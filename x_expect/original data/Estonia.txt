The UK's permanent representative to the UN, Dame Barbara Woodward, has told an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council that "Russia has brought us to the brink", as she urged the country to "step back".

Cabinet minister Sajid Javid said: "We are waking up to a very dark day in Europe and it's clear from what we have already seen and found out today that the Russians, President Putin, has decided to attack the sovereignty of Ukraine and its territorial integrity."

The Health Secretary told Sky News: "We have seen that he has recognised these breakaway eastern regions in Ukraine and from the reports we can already tell that he has sent in tanks and troops.

"From that you can conclude that the invasion of Ukraine has begun."

Latvia's foreign minister said sanctions are effective in the long term in response to Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine.

Edgars Rinkevics told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "In a short perspective, yes of course - sanctions cannot stop Russia from invading Ukraine or from doing what they did, but in the long term, especially, those sanctions are related to technology transfers, to financial sector, they actually would slow down developmental pressure and that would actually repeat some kind of Soviet Union experience.

"That at one given time in history, Soviet Union simply collapsed."

He called for the UK, EU and US to apply sanctions to oligarchs and key contacts of Mr Putin, increase Nato's presence on Russia's borders from the Baltics to Romania, to support civil society in Russia, and back Ukraine financially and with military equipment.

The sanctions being considered by Boris Johnson will target individuals closely linked to the Kremlin, Sajid Javid said.

The Health Secretary told LBC: "There will be sanctions, the Prime Minister has been clear about that.

"I am sure from what has already been shared by the Prime Minister that individuals that have close contacts with the Russian regime will be targeted, as will certain economic sectors."

Kurt Volker, a former US ambassador to Nato, said Russia's actions in Ukraine have created a "very dire" situation.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Russian leader Vladimir Putin's decision to recognise two regions of Ukraine as independent states "opens the door to a lot of new steps by Russia".

"We've already seen him putting forces into those territories. The portion of Luhansk and Donetsk that Russia occupies are not the entire territory of Luhansk and Donetsk.

"So that also opens the possibility that they will view Ukraine as an occupier of those territories, and then fight to remove Ukrainian forces and take more.

"That in turn could lead to much greater skirmishes and fighting with Ukrainian forces which could easily escalate out of control, so this is a very, very dire time."

He said "devastating sanctions" should be imposed immediately.

General Sir Richard Sherriff, Britain's former top Nato commander, has called the Ukraine situation the most perilous in Europe for decades.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "This is the most dangerous moment in Europe probably at least since 1962 and the Cuban missile crisis, but it could be much worse than that because this is the invasion of a sovereign country which could turn into a catastrophic war with warfare on a scale not seen in Europe since 1945.

"So I think it's difficult to overstate the seriousness of the situation."

He said that while the war would initially be between Ukraine and Russia, the possibility that Nato could get involved is "very real".

He told the programme: "Nato has got to man the ramparts now."

He added that the West has to "assume the worst" when it comes to Russia's nuclear strategy.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has "completely torn up international law" by his actions in Ukraine and there will now be an "immediate package of economic sanctions", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.

These sanctions will be aimed not just at entities at regions including Donetsk but also "in Russia itself, targeting Russian economic interests as hard as we can".

He said further details will be given in the House of Commons later today.

Mr Johnson was speaking in Downing Street after a 6.30am meeting of the Cobra committee where he was briefed on the latest intelligence after Mr Putin ordered his troops to carry out "peacekeeping" duty in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Boris Johnson has said the "first barrage of UK economic sanctions against Russia" will be revealed today as he warned Vladimir Putin is bent on a "full scale invasion of Ukraine".

After hosting an emergency Cobra meeting, the Prime Minister said: "This is I should stress just the first barrage of UK economic sanctions against Russia because we expect I'm afraid that there is more Russian irrational behaviour to come.

"I'm afraid all the evidence is that President Putin is indeed bent on a full scale invasion of the Ukraine, the overrunning, the subjugation of an independent, sovereign European country and I think, let's be absolutely clear, that will be absolutely catastrophic."

Boris Johnson said the UK will work to ensure that "Putin should fail" if he carries out a full-scale invasion of Kyiv, "which is what he seems to be proposing to do".

The Prime Minister told broadcasters that the UK will continue diplomatic efforts to avert violence but added: "I just want everybody to be in no doubt that if Vladimir Putin continues down this track of violence, of aggression, of a full-scale invasion, of encircling Kyiv itself which is what he seems to be proposing to do, capturing the Ukrainian capital, it is absolutely vital that that effort, that conquest of another European country, should not succeed and that Putin should fail."

Boris Johnson said the UK's sanctions will hit the "economic interests that have been supporting Russia's war machine".

Speaking after a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee, the Prime Minister said: "They will hit Russia very hard and there is a lot more that we are going to do in the event of an invasion.

"Be in no doubt that if Russian companies are prevented from raising capital on the UK financial markets, if we unpeel the facade of Russian ownership of companies, of property, it will start to hurt."

Boris Johnson said there had been a failure to stand up to Russia in 2014 when Crimea was annexed.

"We have got to recognise that we were not tough enough and in the end we didn't do enough, as Europeans, to wean ourselves off Russian hydrocarbons, off Russian oil and gas," the Prime Minister said.

The volatility in gas prices in Europe was a "consequence of that failure", he said.

"We have got to make sure that we cut the umbilicus, we snip the drip feed into our bloodstream from Nord Stream," he added.

Boris Johnson said Russian President Vladimir Putin has "gravely miscalculated" the situation.

"He believes that Ukraine has no real right to exist as a sovereign, independent country," the Prime Minister said.

"But that goes against everything that we struggled to achieve at the end of the Cold War, it goes against the aspirations of the Ukrainian people.

"The most difficult thing now for Vladimir Putin in prosecuting this war... he will come up against something that I think will be very hard for him to beat, and that is the Ukrainian sense of national pride and their determination to defend their country and to fight for it."

Speaking about the crisis in Ukraine at a Joint Expeditionary Force defence ministerial meeting in Leicestershire on Tuesday, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: "What we saw through the night was President Putin's declaration that he is going to recognise independent states in the Donbas region, which includes territory which is actually on the other side of the line of control.

"We've seen, in open source reporting, Russian military equipment moving into that region.

"We'll have to verify that given what we know about Russian media performances and truth versus reality.

"These are worrying signs, of course - the clear fact that Russia has broken international law, and I just want to point correspondents to President Putin's speech itself."

Boris Johnson said shifting away from Russian oil and gas would help with energy security.

The Prime Minister said: "In the UK we have been able to reduce our dependency on Russian gas very substantially.

"Only 3% of our gas supplies now come from Russia."

Mr Johnson said the response includes granting licences for UK gas reserves but also shifting to low-carbon energy, including nuclear power.

He added: "The faster this country can be more self-reliant on our own energy, the more prosperous we will be, but also, of course, the more sustainable our energy prices will be, and that will benefit the UK consumer."

Continuing his opening speech at the Joint Expeditionary Force defence ministerial meeting, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: "It's incredibly serious what's happening in Ukraine.

"Many of us were forewarning that President Putin already had an agenda - you heard that agenda in his speech last night.

"This is a sovereign state which has now had some of its land effectively annexed from it.

"This is a sovereign state, a democratic state in Europe. All of us in Europe should worry and not hesitate to take whatever action we need to to deter President Putin from undermining both Nato, but also Europe and, more importantly, our values."

Cabinet minister Sajid Javid compared the Ukraine situation to the Cuban Missile Crisis at the height of the Cold War.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I do think it's as serious a situation as that. There is still an opportunity here for President (Vladimir) Putin to step back, despite him having now chosen confrontation over dialogue. It is not to late for him to step back and bring his troops back into Russia and open dialogue.

"But we have to be realistic - clearly that does not seem his intent, certainly at this point in time, and we have to respond very significantly.

"This is a real test for the West as well."

Ukraine is not a member of Nato, but Mr Javid made clear that if Russia does carry on and invade one of the alliance's eastern states, then there will be war.

"If the territorial integrity of a single Nato member is violated then that is tantamount to declaring war on every member of Nato."

Hungarian airline Wizz Air said it will continue to operate flights between the UK and Ukraine.

It said in a statement: "Wizz Air continues to closely monitor the situation in Ukraine.

"Currently, we have not made any changes to our schedule and all of our flights to/from Ukraine continue to operate as normal.

"All passengers with booked flights to and from Ukraine are advised to regularly check their mailboxes for further information about booked flights."

Speaking about the Ukraine crisis at the Joint Expeditionary Force defence ministerial meeting on Tuesday, Latvian minister Artis Pabriks said: "They (Russia) will have a small period of reconnaissance and thinking about what the West is doing and what it is planning.

"They will assess the responses, and if these responses aren't strong enough or convincing enough then the next stage will be more incidents on the de facto Ukrainian border.

"This will not be stopped by simply trying to apply for his mercy - it can only be stopped if we mean business and we are ready to engage.

"Our answer should be, 'our dear friend, we are a very peaceful alliance, but we are also ready to go into war for our freedoms. We are not afraid of you. If you want a war, you will get a war'."

The Foreign Office is increasing the support available to help Britons leave Ukraine.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: "The safety and security of British nationals in Ukraine is our top priority.

"All Brits should leave now via commercial routes while they are still available.

"We are bolstering our teams in the region to support British people as they leave and once they have crossed the border."

The deployment of Russian troops to two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine "amounts to renewed invasion of the country", Downing Street said.

But the UK does not currently view the move as a "full-scale invasion", according to the Prime Minister's official spokesman.

Asked for the Government's assessment of what will happen next, he told reporters: "There is no doubt that the deployment of these forces that we've seen reported in sovereign Ukrainian territory amounts to renewed invasion of the country. President Putin has sent his troops in, he's broken international law, he's repudiated the Minsk agreement.

"We believe that Russia's actions overnight could well be a precursor to a full-scale invasion. But clearly, we want to continue to pursue any diplomatic avenues that exist and we'll be speaking to other world leaders, as I say, and urging Russia to step back from this action."

The PM's spokesman went on to say: "I think what is true is that we do not see a full-scale invasion currently taking place. As I say, we have seen the deployment of these forces, which does amount to an invasion in that area. I wouldn't say necessarily it's a two-step process, but we will continue to see if there are ways to get Russia to pull back."

Downing Street said the UK would be prepared to "go further" with sanctions "should Russia choose to proceed with further aggression" towards Ukraine.

Asked if it was time for a "full panoply" of sanctions, or if there was still time for a "graduated approach", Boris Johnson's official spokesman said: "I'm not going to get into full details of what the Prime Minister will rightly set out to the House.

"He said this morning this would be the first barrage of sanctions, which gives you... an idea of what we will be setting out, and obviously we stand ready to go further should Russia choose to proceed with further aggression."

The Foreign Office is sending "rapid deployment teams" to countries neighbouring Ukraine to assist British nationals who cross over the border, Downing Street said.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said teams were being deployed to Poland, Moldova, Lithuania and Slovakia to provide consular support.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman told reporters: "This morning the Foreign Office has summoned the Russian ambassador. The meeting is expected to be taking place about now."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Russia's ambassador Andrei Kelin had been summoned "to explain Russia's violation of international law and disregard of Ukraine's sovereignty".

"We are imposing severe sanctions in response," she added.

Mr Kelin was meeting the senior official at the Foreign Office, permanent under-secretary Sir Philip Barton.

Downing Street said the Prime Minister believes it is right to "snip the feed of Nord Stream from our bloodstream".

It comes after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz took the significant step of blocking the certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would have supplied gas directly from Russia to Germany.

Asked if Boris Johnson was pleased by the move, his official spokesman said: "Yes. I mean, we've seen what the Germans have said on this. And I think, you know, this has been something that the Prime Minister has been calling for for some time, and indeed again this morning - that Europe has to wean itself off Russian hydrocarbons.

"It's a point we've made consistently with regards to Nord Stream 2. As the Prime Minister said, it's right that we snip the feed of Nord Stream from our bloodstream."

Prime Minister Boris Johnson accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of having "flagrantly violated" the Minsk peace agreements by recognising the "supposed independence" of two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine, telling MPs: "In a single inflammatory speech, he denied that Ukraine had any tradition of genuine statehood, claimed that it posed a direct threat to the security of Russia and hurled numerous other false accusations and aspersions."

Mr Johnson said Russian tanks and armed personnel carriers have "since been spotted" in the breakaway regions, adding: "The House should be in no doubt that the deployment of these forces in sovereign Ukrainian territory amounts to a renewed invasion of that country.

"And by denying Ukraine's legitimacy as a state and presenting its very existence as a mortal threat to Russia, Putin is establishing the pretext for a full-scale offensive."

Boris Johnson told MPs: "I think honourable members will struggle to understand or to contemplate how in the year 2022 a national leader might calmly and deliberately plot the destruction of a peaceful neighbour.

"Yet the evidence of his own words suggest that is exactly what President Putin is doing.

"When I said on Saturday that his scheme to subvert and invade Ukraine was already in motion before our eyes, the events of the last 24 hours have sadly shown this to be true.

"We must now brace ourselves for the next possible stages of Putin's plan.

"The violent subversion of areas of eastern Ukraine by Russian operatives and their hirelings followed by a general offensive by the nearly 200,000 Russian troops gathered on the frontiers at peak readiness to attack."

Boris Johnson told MPs: "If the worst happens then a European nation of 44 million men, women and children would become the target of a full-scale war of aggression waged without a shred of justification for the absurd and even mystical reasons that Putin described last night."

In response to President Putin's military action in Ukraine, the Prime Minister told MPs: "Now the UK and our allies will begin to impose the sanctions on Russia that we have already prepared using the new and unprecedent powers granted by this House to sanction Russian individuals and entities of strategic importance to the Kremlin."

Those being sanctioned included five Russian banks and three "very high net worth" individuals.

Boris Johnson added: "Any assets they hold in the UK will be frozen, the individuals concerned will be banned from travelling here and we will prohibit all UK individuals and entities from having any dealings with them.

"This the first tranche, the first barrage of what we are prepared to do and we hold further sanctions at readiness to be deployed."

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the resolve of the UK to defend Nato allies is "absolute" and "immovable".

He told MPs: "Let me emphasise what I believe unites every member of this House with equal determination: the resolve of the United Kingdom to defend our Nato allies is absolute and immovable.

"We've already doubled the size of our deployment in Estonia, where the British Army leads Nato's battle group, and when I met President Levits of Latvia, Prime Minister Kallas of Estonia in Munich on Saturday I told them that we will be willing to send more British forces to help protect our allies if Nato makes such a request.

"We cannot tell what will happen in the days ahead, but we should steel ourselves for a protracted crisis.

"The United Kingdom will meet this challenge side by side with our allies, determined that we will not allow Putin to drag our continent back into a Hobbesian state of nature."

The UK will "not give up" on a diplomatic solution to tension in Ukraine, the Prime Minister said as he announced new sanctions against Russia.

Boris Johnson said: "I will tell the House we will not give up. We will continue to seek a diplomatic solution until the last possible moment.

"But we have to face the possibility that none of our messages has been heeded and that Putin is implacably determined to go further in subjugating and tormenting Ukraine.

"It is because we suspect this much that the UK and our allies repeatedly sounded the alarm about possible new invasions and we disclosed much of what we knew about Russia's military build-up."

Boris Johnson said it is "precisely because the stakes are so high that Putin's venture in Ukraine must fail, must ultimately fail and must be seen to fail".

The Prime Minister added: "That will require the perseverance and the unity and the resolve of the entire western alliance and Britain, the UK, will do everything possible to ensure that that unity is maintained.

"And now, our thoughts should turn to our valued Ukrainian friends, who threatened no one, who asked for nothing except to live in peace and freedom.

"We will keep faith with them in the critical days that lie ahead. And whatever happens, Britain will not waver in our resolve."

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: "We know Putin's playbook. He seeks division. We must stay united."

He told the House of Commons: "Yesterday was a dark day for Europe.

"We must all stand firm in our support for Ukraine. We support the freedom of her people and their right to determine their own future without the gun of an imperialist held to their head.

"There can be no excuses for Russia's actions. There is no justification for this aggression."

He said President Vladimir Putin fears democracy and knows that, given a choice, people will not choose to live under the rule of an "erratic and violent authoritarian".

Sir Keir added: "So we must remain united and true to our values across this House and with our Nato allies. We must show Putin that we will not be divided."

Boris Johnson insisted there is "no chance" of holding football tournaments in a Russia that "invades sovereign countries".

With St Petersburg due to host this season's Uefa Champions League Final, the Prime Minister told MPs: "It's absolutely vital in this critical moment that President Putin understands that what he is doing is going to be a disaster for Russia.

"And it is clear from the response of the world to what he has done already in Donbas that he is going to end up with a Russia that is poorer as a result of the sanctions that the world will implement.

"A Russia that is more isolated, a Russia that has pariah status - no chance of holding football tournaments in a Russia that invades sovereign countries.

"A Russia that is engaged in a bloody and debilitating conflict with a fellow Slav country. What an appalling result for President Putin.

"I hope that he steps back from the brink and does not conduct a full invasion."

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the sanctions announced by Boris Johnson and the collective international response, but said "we must be prepared to go further".

Sir Keir said he understands the tactic of holding back sanctions to try to deter an invasion of the rest of Ukraine, "but a threshold has already been breached".

He said a sovereign nation "has been invaded in a war of aggression", and "if we do not respond with the full set of sanctions now Putin will once again take away the message that the benefits of aggression outweigh the costs".

He said he would work with the Prime Minister and international allies "to ensure that more sanctions are introduced".

He said Russia should be excluded from financial mechanisms like Swift, trading in Russian sovereign debt should be banned, Russia Today should be prevented from "broadcasting its propaganda around the world", and Nord Stream 2 should be cancelled.

Boris Johnson suggested the UK will consider offering further military support to Ukraine.

He told the Commons: "The UK will continue to offer support to our Ukrainian friends.

"I do think it's been right for us to be out in front in offering military assistance, defensive military assistance to the Ukrainians. I think that has been the right thing to do.

"I spoke last night to President Zelensky, who made further requests, and we will consider them - we're doing everything we can to offer support in the time that we have and we will do that."

Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves tweeted: "Labour stands in solidarity with the Ukrainian people who have shown resilience throughout Putin's aggression.

"This too must be a turning point and mark an end to the UK being a soft touch on oligarchs and illicit finance."

SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford gave his backing to the sanctions imposed on Russia and said his party stood united with the UK Government.

Mr Blackford added: "We stand with the Ukrainian people who are now under us all. A European country, an ally, is under attack.

"We should be very clear about what is now happening. This is an illegal Russian occupation of Ukraine just as it was in Crimea.

"Russia has effectively annexed another two Ukrainian regions in a blatant breach of international law. This effectively ends the Minsk process.

"It is a further violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.

"No one should even repeat the Russian lie that this is about peacekeeping. This is warmongering, plain and simple."

Conservative former prime minister Theresa May said the world was in the "gravest of times" which shows "we can never take our eyes off Russia".

Mrs May told the Commons: "While the focus today is rightly on protecting Ukrainian independence and territorial integrity, what lies behind this is a wider worldwide trend of authoritarian states trying to impose their way of thinking on others.

"And that the battle in which we must now engage is nothing more or less than the defence of democracy itself."

Boris Johnson said Mrs May was "entirely right", adding: "That is what's at stake and what happens in Ukraine now is being watched around the world, and the echoes will be heard in Taiwan, in east Asia and throughout the world."

In a joint statement, the 10 defence ministers of the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) said: "We have reviewed the progress we have made in the development of the JEF as an agile, capable and ready force, and today agreed to undertake a series of integrated military activities across our part of northern Europe - at sea, on land and in the air.

"For example, we will shortly conduct an exercise demonstrating JEF nations' freedom of movement in the Baltic Sea.

"These and subsequent activities will remain preventative and proportionate.

"In acting together, we shall demonstrate the JEF's solidarity, capability and resolve to stand together for security and stability in our region."

The BBC Russian service should receive more funding so Russian people can "hear the truth" about what is happening in Ukraine, the Prime Minister has heard.

In the Commons, Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Tom Tugendhat asked: "May I ask, as we are talking about sanctions today and rightly so, will he commit to a foreign agents registration act?

"We have seen the action of the insidious work of the United Front for China and indeed of different outfits for Russia to undermine our democracy and threaten our way of life.

"Would he please bring in that act? And while he is doing it will he finance much more the Russian service of the BBC so that the Russian people can hear the truth and not the lies that are being spread by their own government?"

The Prime Minister replied: "I think the Russian service of the BBC has done an invaluable job and I think it is very important that it should continue to be financed.

"On his proposal for a foreign agent registration law, we are indeed considering what more we can to do counter threats to this country from within."

Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy tweeted: "We welcome the sanctions announced today, but we should go further.

"We need to impose a full set of sanctions now. If we do not, Putin will once again take away the message that the benefits of aggression outweigh the costs."

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said "we must stand ready with more military support for Ukraine to defend itself and we must stand ready to do more to reassure and reinforce Nato allies in eastern Europe".

Sir Keir said "we must also get our own house in order", adding "we have failed to stop the flow of illicit Russian finance into Britain" and that "Russian money has been allowed to influence our politics".

"We have to admit that mistakes have been made," he said, adding "this must be a turning point, an end to oligarch impunity".

He said Companies House must not provide "easy cover" for shell companies, and that anti-money laundering laws must be enforced, "we need to crack down on spies", and "we have to make sure money isn't pouring into UK politics from abroad".

He also asked what international efforts were going on to pursue diplomacy, saying "even at this late hour we must pursue diplomatic routes to prevent further conflict".

Sir Keir offered the support of the opposition to "do the right thing" and said President Putin "believes the benefits of aggression outweigh the consequences, so we must take a stand".

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said Vladimir Putin should not be allowed to "exploit" events like the Champions League final to legitimise the invasion of Ukraine.

"I have serious concerns about the sporting events due to be held in Russia, such as the Champions League final, and will discuss with the relevant governing bodies," she said.

"We won't allow President Putin to exploit events on the world stage to legitimise his illegal invasion of Ukraine."

Ukraine will have to be given the "means to defend itself" from future aggression or some "sort of security guarantee", Conservative former cabinet minister Liam Fox has said.

The MP for North Somerset told the House of Commons: "Can I say to my right honourable friend, sanctions can only achieve so much when dealing with an undemocratic state and someone like Putin. What we're witnessing is the real-time cannibalisation of a European democratic state bite by bite.

"And ultimately, we will have to ensure that either Ukraine is given the means to defend itself from future aggression or give some sort of security guarantee, or we will find Russian troops on the borders of Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Hungary, which would be an absolute failure of western policy."

Prime Minister Boris Johnson replied: "He's completely right in the sense that we will have to dig in for the long term to support Ukraine in every way that we can, economically, diplomatically, by the provision of military support, in the way that we are already."

Julian Lewis, the Conservative chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, called on the Prime Minister to "accept 3% of GDP on defence as a suitable future benchmark".

He asked: "Does (he) accept that too many Nato governments and political parties have accepted energy dependence on Putin and financial dependence on dodgy donations from Russian oligarchs?

"Given that we spent between 4.5 and 5% of GDP on defence throughout the 1980s until the end of the Cold War, will he now accept 3% of GDP on defence as a suitable future benchmark?"

Boris Johnson replied: "Completely right to say that we have failed to wean ourselves off dependence on Russian hydrocarbons since 2014, I think that's been a tragic mistake by European countries.

"In the UK we're in the fortunate position of only having 3% of our gas coming from Russia, but other European countries have learned that they have much more to do.

"By the way, I salute the decision of the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to cancel Nord Stream 2. I think it's a brave step by Olaf and the right thing to do.

"On his point about defence spending, actually we're up at 2.4% now of GDP, I think one of the very highest in Nato, and we are the second biggest contributor, second biggest military power, in Nato already."

The UK should lead a "new European front against authoritarianism and autocracy" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a Ukrainian MP has said.

Dmytro Natalukha, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament's economic affairs committee, told a think tank event on Tuesday that the UK was Ukraine's "boldest" ally.

Speaking from Kyiv to an event hosted by the London-based Council on Geostrategy, Mr Natalukha said: "I think that it's time for London to keep up the absolutely squashed European leadership and to become a new leader in Europe and build up a new European front against authoritarianism and autocracy.

"There is a vacuum of power, a vacuum of leadership, in the European continent. That vacuum needs to be filled and I think this potential alliance of London, Kyiv and Warsaw is a very great step towards filling that vacuum."

Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: "First of all Russia has already invaded Ukraine - they did it in 2014.

"They occupied illegally Crimea, Donbas, and this is a further invasion of that sovereign territory.

"No-one recognises the legitimacy of the occupation and annexation of Crimea - not even the Chinese have recognised that to date.

"We see this next step into Donbas - the recognition of these republics - not only against international law, but basically breaches, or trashes, of the Minsk Agreements, making it very hard to see a resolution in that space."

Russia's ambassador to the UK was told his country would "pay the price for its actions" after he was summoned to the Foreign Office.

Andrei Kelin was called to meet the Foreign Office's senior civil servant, Sir Philip Barton, on the orders of Liz Truss.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: "The UK has urged Russia to explain its recognition of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic and the movement of military forces into Ukraine.

"We have summoned the ambassador today to stress that such actions are a violation of international law.

"The UK reiterates its unshakeable commitment to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine, and insists that Russia immediately withdraw all of its military forces.

"We made clear to the Russian ambassador that Russia would pay the price for its actions through further sanctions if it did not withdraw its troops."

Boris Johnson said "we should not allow our indignation, our rage, at what is happening in Ukraine to spill over into casual Russophobia".

Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi said in the Commons: "I am glad that the Prime Minister is talking tough and taking a strong stand against continued Russian aggression and imperialism, but when will he himself stop playing tennis with Russian oligarchs in exchange for money for the Conservative Party?"

The MP for Slough asked when the Prime Minister will fully implement the recommendations of the Russia report.

Mr Johnson responded by saying the Government is "way out in front of" European partners in what it is doing to implement sanctions on Russian entities.

He said: "Yes, it is absolutely vital that nobody should contribute to a political party in this country unless they are a UK national. And that is something that this Government insists upon.

"But what I don't think we should see, if I may just respectfully say - and I've just been listening to some of the contributions this morning - we should not allow our indignation, our rage, at what is happening in Ukraine to spill over into casual Russophobia.

"I don't want to see us discriminating against Russians as a people or simply on the basis of their nationality."

The way the West responds to Russian troops entering Ukraine will dictate what happens with China and Taiwan, Conservative former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith has said.

Sir Iain told MPs: "Should it not be now - and I commend what he has done so far - but should it not be that we need to hit them if we are going to hit them with sanctions hard and hit them now?

"They need to feel the pain of the first part of this decision. The second thing is, what is the ultimatum to them now? If they move further, are we going to take further action?

"And I simply say right now, we are facing the growth of the axis of totalitarian states. China will watch this and look at Taiwan, how we behave now and what we do as an alliance will dictate what happens in the far east."

Boris Johnson replied: "We are hitting them hard now and we will hit them harder in the future with every day that goes by which they violate the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine, we will continue to punish Russia and, in the end, I don't believe that President Putin has thought this through and I do think that he will fail."

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace continued: "We have a range of sanctions, we've made them public - we put them before Parliament a few weeks ago.

"We have chosen to use some of those sanctions - that doesn't mean to say we won't use more.

"We are prepared with a whole raft of sanctions.

"We also know that the most important message to send to President Putin is that we are completely unified across Nato, the EU and the US and the UK.

"We must do all of these things in lockstep - that's what we're doing."

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey urged the Prime Minister to "go further".

He said: "Freeze and begin seizing the assets of every single one of Putin's cronies in the UK and then expel these oligarchs from our country as part of a much stronger sanctions regime.

"Second, recognise the existential threat posed by Putin to our Nato allies by immediately cancelling (the Prime Minister's) own decision, his misguided decision, to cut our armed forces by 10,000 troops, and third, no longer tolerate international sporting or cultural events hosted in Russia.

"Can I confirm what I think he implied... that he will push for this year's Champions League final to be moved from St Petersburg? President Putin has made a terrible decision, will the Prime Minister make sure he pays a terrible price?"

Boris Johnson replied: "Yes... we are indeed cracking down on ill-gotten gains in London and on the cronies of Vladimir Putin.

"On his point about sporting events... I think it inconceivable that major international football tournaments can take place in Russia after, as I say, the invasion of a sovereign country."

The Prime Minister faced pressure from Labour and Tory backbenchers to go further with sanctions, as Russia had "already committed the crimes that deserve the most punishment".

Labour former minister Hilary Benn said: "The Prime Minister said... 'there is a lot more that we are going to do in the event of an invasion'. The Prime Minister has just told the House that he regards what happened overnight as a 'renewed invasion of Ukraine'. If that is the Government's view then why is he waiting before imposing full sanctions on Russia now?"

Boris Johnson replied: "I have been very clear that what we have wanted to do is have the biggest possible package of sanctions ready to go in the event of the Russians crossing into more sovereign Ukrainian territory. What we will also do is make sure that the sanctions that we implement are done in concert with our allies. That is what we are doing."

Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin (Harwich) said: "President Putin has already achieved so much of what he has set out to achieve and he may have no intention of launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but he has already committed the crimes that deserve the most punishment from the free world.

"What are we going to do to continue to strengthen Nato, to unify Nato, which is exactly, of course, what he didn't want his policy to achieve?"

Mr Johnson said: "What he has succeeded in doing is greatly to unify Nato and to produce a much bigger commitment not just by the UK but by other European powers to reinforce Nato's eastern frontier."

Vladimir Putin could turn Russia into a "pariah state", Boris Johnson has warned.

In the Commons, the Labour MP for Knowsley, Sir George Howarth, said: "For over a decade Russia has been mounting cyber attacks on our critical national infrastructure and commercial infrastructure. For over a decade and there were no consequences.

"For over a decade Russia has been swirling dirty money around the City of London with no consequences.

"In order for Vladimir Putin to understand that he has now gone too far, he needs to be certain that if sanctions and diplomatic means don't succeed, then there will be consequences. Can the Prime Minister agree with me that those consequences need to be still on the table and Vladimir Putin needs to understand that they will be used?"

Boris Johnson replied: "We need to make it absolutely clear to Russia that as a result of this venture, this ill-conceived and disastrous venture in Ukraine, his country will end up, as I have said, poorer, more encircled by Nato, and engaged in a disastrous conflict with fellow Slavs - and a pariah state.

"That is what President Putin is willing on his people, a pariah state."

The Prime Minister said "it's great that the German Chancellor also now sees the importance" of defence spending, adding he had been campaigning for a long time for Germany "to shoulder more of the defence burden" in Europe and "that's a good thing".

He was responding in the Commons to Conservative former defence minister Johnny Mercer, who welcomed the sanctions but said: "We can't continue to consistently relearn the lessons of the past when it comes to drawing a line and being willing to hold that line military, if so."

The MP for Plymouth Moor View acknowledged defence spending has risen, but said the funding must be tailored to meet the threat, adding: "As the German Chancellor has mentioned this morning, that threat is changing."

He asked the Prime Minister to "keep an eye on that defence spending to make sure that if we are asked we can hold a line and we could lead Nato in the way that I know he wants to".

Boris Johnson said: "We have seen massive increases in our defence spending but we want to make sure that it is targeted on things like tackling cyber, disinformation, all the modern forms of warfare in which Putin also specialises."

Mr Johnson also said the threat "is not just to Europe, the threat from an aggressive and expansionist Russian agenda is everywhere, including in Africa".

Conservative former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt pressed the Prime Minister to increase defence spending and go further on sanctions.

Mr Hunt said he "strongly" supported the "robust" approach taken by the UK Government, adding: "But Putin will have predicted and discounted western sanctions long ago, so does he agree that if we are not to be behind in the diplomatic chess game, we need to do some things that he is not expecting?

"Firstly, a sustained increase in western defence capability and spend, and secondly, a sustained reduction in the ability of the Russian state to finance its own armed forces with economic and financial sanctions that don't last just until the next government decides to have a reset but, if necessary, for as long as this dangerous man remains president of Russia?"

Boris Johnson highlighted increased defence spending in the UK, adding in the Commons: "We will sustain that increase in defence spending and he's absolutely right about the financing of Putin's armed forces.

"The tragedy is that they've been financed from the proceeds of the sale of Russian oil and gas to western European nations and that is what's got to end."

Tobias Ellwood, Conservative chairman of the Defence Committee, said Nato "must not be benched".

He said: "Sanctions alone will not be enough, indeed untargeted sanctions may play into Putin's plan to pivot Russia ever closer to China.

"So would the Prime Minister agree Nato must not be benched?

"It was created to uphold European security and we must now consider how we utilise our formidable hard power deterrence in responding to Ukraine's calls for further help, not excluding the formation of a potential no-fly zone."

Boris Johnson replied: "What Nato is not doing and no Nato country is currently considering is sending combat troops to Ukraine, and he will understand the reasons for that, but that does not preclude support by Nato countries for Ukraine and including military support."

The Prime Minister said in addition to military assistance for eastern European allies, "we also need to share technology, particularly in renewables, to allow them to find a different future" and rely less on Russian energy.

He was responding in the Commons to Conservative former business secretary Andrea Leadsom, who asked for assurance that the Prime Minister was already considering what more could be done to protect allies in eastern Europe "from the inevitable consequences of the risky position we find ourselves in, in the dead of winter, with so much dependence on Russian gas".

Boris Johnson also said: "We need to work together to wean ourselves off, to end the dependency on Russian gas."

Conservative former minister Mark Harper asked for assurances that Boris Johnson will implement "further and stronger measures even if President Putin does no more".

Mr Johnson replied: "I think it's inevitable, given what is happening in Ukraine and on the borders of Ukraine, that we will be coming forward with a much bigger package of sanctions.

"What you have today is an opening barrage that we're doing in common with our friends and allies."

Conservative MP John Baron (Basildon and Billericay) told Mr Johnson: "I hope he takes away from this exchange today the strong cross-party support for tougher sanctions now, because that is what is needed."

He also asked the Prime Minister to consider a "substantial and sustained increase" in defence spending to ensure peace and stability.

Addressing reporters at the Joint Expeditionary Force meeting, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: "Ukraine matters because many other countries are watching.

"Our resolve has been tested, as has the ambitions of President Putin's legacy.

"President Putin wants a legacy, it's our duty to make sure he gets a legacy, but not the one he is planning."

Asked if it was too late for diplomacy, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: "It's never too late for diplomacy.

"We have spent weeks trying across Europe. President Macron has tried, the Chancellor of Germany has tried, the Prime Minister... has tried.

"He has not been short of people trying to engage both directly with him, and indeed, many of us in this room have tried to engage with a number of our counterparts.

"So it is never too late, but as I've always said, we'll take them at their word and judge them by their actions."

Asked if Vladimir Putin was planning further invasions in eastern Europe, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: "The actions we've seen today and last night are absolutely according to his playbook.

"It's according to what he wrote in July last year, and if you want to know what his next intentions are, I recommend you listen to his latest speech, that he made last night, full of huge inaccuracies, one of which was that Ukraine is not a proper state.

"I should remind people, Ukraine has been separate to Russia as a nation longer than it has been part of Russia, that is a simple fact of history.

"He should look at his history books, and not selectively pick dates that suit his narrative."

Addressing reporters at the meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Force in Leicestershire on Tuesday, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: "First of all we've doubled from battlegroup to two battlegroups and a brigade headquarters into Estonia.

"We've made available 1,000 troops on readiness - they haven't been deployed.

"A lot of that will be done through the Supreme Allied Commander in Nato to make it available to him should he wish to place them in a place that will counter any threat.

"And we're absolutely open to doing even more if required because we need to send that clear signal to President (Vladimir) Putin.

"As I have warned and warned the Kremlin for weeks and months that as we knew in 2014 he gets the opposite of what he wants.

"He will get more forces on his borders, but just as he did in 2014, he will no doubt get more spending on defence from Nato to things that strategically would be the opposite of what he should be potentially wanting to achieve."

Sanctions on five Russian banks and three individuals announced on Tuesday are "impressive", Conservative MP Jonathan Djanogly has said.

Mr Djanogly, who is vice-chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Ukraine, told a think tank event that the West could return Russia "to the economic dark ages" if it chose to do so, but that this would require coordinated action.

He said it was "impressive" that the Prime Minister had announced sanctions so soon after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying: "In the past, he would not have done that. He would have come to the dispatch box and said we would be working with our European allies."

He added that ministers had given him the feeling that they were "going to take economic sanctions very seriously" and that there were "signs in recent days of the EU pulling together".

Continuing to speak to reporters in Leicestershire on Tuesday, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: "Russia's malign activity is global. Only a few days ago, the French announced a withdrawal from Mali because of the presence and establishment of Wagner, the Russian mercenary group, in that country, joining up with the Malian Government.

"Russia is practising significant amounts of intimidation of the Black Sea, Russia is deploying significant amount of submarines and others into the Atlantic, and indeed further abroad.

"Only last year they went to Hawaii with a significant number of ships which hadn't been seen since the Cold War.

"I think what is clear here is that the president has decided he wants to demonstrate a new Russia, in his view, a Russia with new invested arms and equipment.

"We've seen satellite launches - in fact we've seen the destruction of a satellite that even upset the Chinese not so long ago because of the potential damage it can inflict, and I think that's what we should all be concerned about.

"A man who doesn't follow international law, a man who is now has a very large army on the doorstep of a sovereign state and seems to not even worry that the false flags and the fake news we are watching is so obvious, it is sadly almost comical."

Asked why Russia has not been handed the hardest and harshest sanctions yet, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: "We already have significant sanctions against both individuals and other entities since 2014.

"Secondly the sanctions we have announced today, including against five Russian banks, are significantly harsh.

"There are still more sanctions in the tank, and the main thing is that we do all this together.

"Sometimes that means we have to move at slightly different paces, but fundamentally we are all following a path, both the United Kingdom, the EU, the United States, that will lead to sanctions being ratcheted up and over time I think that is really important that we do it in step.

"If we don't then I think President (Vladimir) Putin would absolutely try to exploit that to his benefit and that's why we will do this today at the level we are.

"On top of that, I think there's a plan to try and have a leaders' meeting to discuss the next stages of Nato."

President Vladimir Putin is in an "irrational frame of mind" and may not respond logically to sanctions, the Prime Minister has warned.

Labour MP for Chester Christian Matheson said: "I welcome the Prime Minister's statement but look, Russia is a mafia sate. Putin is the godfather, the 'capo di tutti i capi', and he won't change until his 'capos' and his under bosses force him to change, and they won't do that until we pull the financial rug from under their feet. We are in a unique position to do it."

Boris Johnson replied: "We are in a position to impose very considerable economic costs on Putin. The question is whether he is going to care enough about it because he is clearly in an illogical and irrational frame of mind."

Elsewhere, Conservative MP Nickie Aiken (Cities of Westminster and London) said the "children of those Russians connected to the Kremlin who may be in schools in this country should be perhaps sent home to Russia and not be allowed to benefit from education within this country".

The Prime Minister replied: "I think when it comes to children, maybe I think I am not quite there. I think that the sins of the fathers or indeed the mothers should not be visited on their children, in my opinion."

It is "inevitable" that there will be more sanctions against Russia, Boris Johnson has said.

The Prime Minister's comments come as Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokeswoman Layla Moran pressed him on what the trigger for further sanctions will be.

She said: "Five banks, three of Putin's cronies but two of which have already been sanctioned by the US. This isn't us working in concert, this is us already behind. I hear what the Prime Minister has said about more sanctions are to come. Can he be clear with us then, what is the trigger?"

Mr Johnson said: "I think it is inevitable that there will be more sanctions to come because I am afraid I think it's inevitable that Vladimir Putin is going to continue with his flagrant violation of international law. What we are doing today is the first barrage that we are orchestrating in concert with our friends and partners, keeping something in reserve because there must still be the possibility that we can avert an hideous outbreak of bloodshed in Ukraine."

Meanwhile, Conservative MP John Howell (Henley), who is the leader of the UK delegation to the Council of Europe, told the Commons he will be calling later today for "the suspension of Russia from the Council of Europe" and asked for the Prime Minister's support.

Mr Johnson replied: "I wholeheartedly support what he just said."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK will go further on sanctions against Russia if it "does not pull back from the brink" in Ukraine.

In a statement, she said: "This first wave of sanctions will hit oligarchs and banks close to the Kremlin. It sends a clear message that the UK will use our economic heft to inflict pain on Russia and degrade their strategic interests.

"And we are prepared to go much further if Russia does not pull back from the brink. We will curtail the ability of the Russian state and Russian companies to raise funds in our markets, prohibit a range of high tech exports, and further isolate Russian banks from the global economy.

"These will be surgically targeted sanctions that will hit Russia hard."

There could be a spike in gas and oil prices as a consequence of "Putin's venture", Boris Johnson has said.

Conservative former minister Robert Halfon told MPs: "Can I just ask my right honourable friend, what assessment have the Government made of the impact from the war on energy prices, of oil prices and the subsequent impact on people, on people at home, and what measures can the Government mitigate those factors, which, as we know, the war is likely to increase the cost of living for ordinary folk across the country?"

Mr Johnson replied: "He is quite right that one of the risks of Putin's venture is that there could be a spike in gas prices, in oil prices...

"The Government will do everything we can to mitigate it and help the people in this country but it's one of the reasons why the whole of Western Europe has got to end their dependence on Russian oil and gas."

Downing Street has rejected suggestions that the sanctions announced by Britain targeting Russian oligarchs and banks would have little effect.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said the measures set out in the House of Commons would have a "real impact" on the Russian economy.

"This only beginning. This is only the first tranche of sanctions we could introduce," the spokesman said.

"The actions we have take together with our Nato allies do create a much more hostile atmosphere for individuals and for banks and will have a real impact on the economic situation in Russia.

"We believe that these are the right measures to introduce now in the light of the actions taken overnight by President (Vladimir) Putin."

Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said "every indication" is that Russia "continues to plan for a full-scale attack" on Ukraine.

But he said "it's never too late to not attack", and urged Russia to "engage in good faith in diplomatic efforts to find a political solution".

Mr Stoltenberg told a press conference in Brussels: "Every indication is that Russia continues to plan for a full scale attack on Ukraine. We see the ongoing military build up... We see that more and more of the forces are moving out of the camps and are in combat formations and ready to strike.

"And we see the ongoing provocations in Donbas and the different false flag operations where they tried to create a pretext for an attack. And then of course we saw last night that further Russian troops moved into Donbas, into parts of Donetsk and Luhansk.

"And then we have the threatening rhetoric, which was actually confirmed in the speech of President Putin yesterday.

"At the same time, it's never too late. It's never too late to not attack. And that's the reason why we continue to call on Russia to step back, to de-escalate, and to engage in good faith in diplomatic efforts to find a political solution."

President Vladimir Putin has called for the "demilitarisation" of Ukraine to end the current crisis.

Speaking at the news conference in Moscow, the Russian leader said the government in Kyiv needed to give up its hopes of joining Nato.

"This would mean that the Western leaders would not lose face," he said, speaking through an interpreter.

Mr Putin re-iterated his concerns that Ukraine could develop nuclear weapons and said "demilitarisation" was the "only objective controlling factor that we could observe and have a proper reaction to".

He added: "Even the appearance of tactical nuclear weaponry in Ukraine, for us this means a strategic threat."

Britain hopes sanctions will prevent further aggression and persuade Russian troops to withdraw and move away from the Ukrainian border, amid concerns the measures do not offer enough of a deterrence.

Conservative former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, speaking as MPs considered the legislation that enabled the UK Government to introduce tougher sanctions, told the Commons: "The question I want to understand more clearly is are we deterring President (Vladimir) Putin from doing more or is the idea to get President Putin to step back?

"Because I'm not all together clear and therefore that means the force of the sanctions is dictated by what we're trying to do."

Foreign Office minister James Cleverly replied: "Our aim is to prevent further aggression, for Russian troops to withdraw from where they have advanced and for them to move away from the Ukrainian border and remove that threat from the Ukrainian people."

Tom Tugendhat, Conservative chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, added: "The ratchet could be misinterpreted as giving a free pass at an early stage rather than drawing a clear line that needs not to be crossed."

Mr Cleverly, in his reply, said: "The pace at which we, in conjunction with our international partners, ratchet up our sanctions response is very much to not just send a message, although sending a message is important, but to actually ensure that these sanctions are meaningfully felt by the Russian leadership and those people around Vladimir Putin funding him and propping him up."

Downing Street said Boris Johnson had spoken to French President Emmanuel Macron about the "chilling developments in Ukraine last night".

In a call on Tuesday afternoon, a No 10 spokesman said: "The Prime Minister updated President Macron on the new sanctions he unveiled against Russia today, and the leaders agreed they needed to continue to work in lockstep to target Russian individuals and entities bankrolling President (Vladimir) Putin's aggressive approach.

"The Prime Minister said that President Putin's actions were a gross violation of international law, and by sending forces into eastern Ukraine he had ripped up the Budapest and Minsk agreements.

"Russia's actions don't just threaten Ukraine's sovereignty, but are a blatant attack on freedom and democracy, the leaders agreed.

"The pair reiterated that together, the UK and France were working to reinforce Europe's borders and defend European security against increasing Russian aggression.

"Both agreed to stay in close contact and speak again in the coming days."

Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said: "The UK Government's actions are not limited to what the Prime Minister has currently announced."

He added: "We are going to bring forward further legislation to further extend the measures available to us."

He said: "We intend to escalate these sanctions, to ratchet up these sanctions, in response to what has already happened in order to deter further aggression and in order to stimulate (Vladimir) Putin to withdraw the troops from Ukraine."

He said the changes would allow the Government "to impose sanctions on a much broader range of individuals and businesses who are or have been involved in... obtaining a benefit from, or supporting, the government of Russia" and would allow sanctions on a "huge scope of individuals and entities", adding: "Should Russian stage any further invasion into Ukraine, we will not hesitate to implement comprehensive and unprecedented additional packages of sanctions in close coordination with our allies around the world."

He added: "These measures will curtail the ability of the Russian state, Russian companies, Russian individuals, to raise funds on our markets and further isolate Russian banks. We will keep ratcheting up the pressure targeting more banks, more individuals, more companies, that are significant to the Kremlin."

He added: "Vladimir Putin has chosen a path of international isolation. The measures that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister announced today demonstrate that they will bare a cost for doing so, and if they do not step back these measures will only increase."

European Union countries have agreed unanimously to adopt a package of sanctions against Russia, the EU's foreign affairs policy chief Josep Borrell has said.

In a press conference, Mr Borrell said it was a "particularly dangerous moment for Europe" and Russia's actions were a "clear escalation of the Russian aggression against Ukraine".

Mr Borrell said that 351 members of the Russian State Duma who "voted (for) this violation of international law" would be sanctioned, as well as "27 individuals and entities who are playing a role in undermining or threatening Ukrainian territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence".

These included "banks that are financing Russia" and "those who waged this information war against Ukraine". He added the bloc would also "target the ability of the Russian state and government to access to our capital and financial markets and services".

He said: "We reached an agreement between the 27 member states - a unanimous agreement to adopt a package of sanctions."

He added that the package would "hurt Russia, and it will hurt a lot".

Oligarchs close to President Vladimir Putin will find it "too easy" to avoid the impact of sanctions, Labour has said.

Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy told MPs his party has "major concerns" and suggestions on how the Government could "go further" on sanctions against Russia.

He said: "Firstly, concerns have been expressed to us that in the way that legislation is currently drafted, oligarchs who are close to Putin will find it too easy to avoid the impact of the measures. They may not hold a formal role in a sanctioned bank or company, but may exert significant control behind the scenes.

"The effects of this would be that some of the most influential and notorious oligarchs, oligarchs who are close to Vladimir Putin, and have purposely structured their enterprises to avoid the appearance of majority ownership and control would go untouched."

Mr Lammy insisted this is a "crucial mistake" as President Putin "couldn't care about sanctions laid against his country or the Russian people", instead, "the only sanctions he really cares about are those against the richest people close to him".

The shadow foreign secretary added: "We believe that we must go further now. Only five banks and three individuals are facing sanctions as a result of UK government's actions today. This is not big enough punishment for the blatant breach of international law that has already been made. And let us not be too slow to act and fall behind our international partners."

The first deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma's committee on international affairs said sanctions imposed on Tuesday by Boris Johnson in light of the Ukraine crisis would have "zero" effect.

Vyacheslav Nikonov told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: "What would be the result of sanctions like they're introduced today by Boris Johnson? Zero, it's nothing. It's sanctioned about three oligarchs and five... small banks. You know, this is a laughable affair, of course.

"We expected something more serious, like switching from... Swift, or cancelling the (buyers) of gas and so on."

The Conservative chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee pressed the Government on why they did not go further on sanctions against Russia.

Tom Tugendhat said: "I welcome the direction that we've taken, but I find myself, I'm afraid along with many others on all sides of this House, asking why not more? Why not further?

"Because what we're doing now is we are in many ways using the actions of a hostile state in eastern Ukraine to justify something that we should have done years ago. The UK sadly has for too long been an avenue for money laundering, for despots and criminals around the world. For too long, we have seen our institutions, our City, our service sector, used to hide the games of corrupt practices abroad and indeed sadly on too many occasions of criminality."

He added: "What he (President Putin) is doing to us, to the people of these islands, is he is unpicking the values and principles that our grandparents fought for 80 years ago. He is unpicking the principle that we embedded into the Constitution of the United Nations, of the Council of Europe. He is unpicking the principle of the rule of law that the debate amongst sovereign peoples should be the way that disputes are settled in this world, and he is replacing the rule of law for the rule of force.

"Sadly, he's demonstrating that not only does it work on the ground, but it also works in the wallet. He's demonstrating that a leader can profit politically and personally from the abuses that he conducts against his own people and his neighbours."

Conservative former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said: "We can do, we should do and we must do more to root out the dirty money that flows through here."

He added: "I really do believe the Government has to take this many notches further and hit them very hard. Yes, with the cleaning out of some of the Augean stables in the financial services area, but secondly also we need to go on grander, more supra national sanctions, working with our allies, absolutely to cut off supplies of money, such that the Russians cannot and President Putin cannot find a way through this and they feel the pain. We must hear them squeal when we hit them with these sanctions."

Sir Iain warned: "We must move, we must move hard, we must move now and we must make them squeal, if we do not do that then we will have failed."

SNP's foreign affairs spokesman Alyn Smith said: "It's weak tea, it's not nothing, but it's not much."

He added: "This is really small beer and I cannot understand it, the UK seems to be casting about for somebody else's leadership because I really don't detect much in the actions and announcements that we've heard today."

Labour's Chris Bryant (Rhondda) said: "We've been pitiful, we've been puny, we've vacillated, we've been spineless and quite often we've looked as if we're craven because we just want Russian money."

He added: "I am angered by the naivety that I sometimes see in this country, I've seen it often in this chamber and I see it too from the Left."

He went on: "Of course I support the statutory instrument, I'm glad we're doing this, but today's sanctions the ones that have been announced today which rely on this, are wholly inadequate."

Conservative former cabinet minister Robert Jenrick said the UK should be taking action "hard now", explaining: "That is what a dictator like (Vladimir) Putin can understand.

"Deterrence by way of sanctions thus far has failed. It's probably likely to fail. It does have value, however, it does show resolve, it does inflict cost on Russia and if we're going to do that why wouldn't we do it strong now?

"I don't understand why we would be suggesting that we would be bringing forward the other measures that I know the Government is considering only in the event that Russia makes further incursions into Ukraine or further serious egregious assaults upon Ukraine or other allies within the region."

Mr Jenrick said he could see Foreign Office minister James Cleverly shaking his head at this suggestion, adding he could understand it if the Government needs further time to develop harsher measures or wants to introduce them at the same time as their allies.

He also told the Commons: "My suggestion to the Government would be to bring forward further measures as quickly as possible, preferably in concert with our allies."

Bob Seely, Conservative MP for Isle of Wight, said "it's quite clear that deterrence has failed" before adding: "I make criticism of policy over the past 10, 15 years, this is too little, too late."

Conservative MP and a former United Nations commander who led peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, Bob Stewart (Beckenham), said: "Mr (Vladimir) Putin may well have won. He may well have won because we've not reacted hard enough.

"Small banks sanctioned, but actually not real sanctions. So he'll be sitting there tonight in Moscow thinking 'I've just got to sit this one out and the gains we've got I will be able to play up extremely well to the Russian people'. We are really in dangerous ground by our weakness."

Conservative MP Jonathan Djanogly (Huntingdon) said thousands of Russians live in the UK, and many are not supportive of President Putin's regime and "many Russians here are here to escape the clutches of Putin's regime".

He said: "For those Russians here I would urge caution and due process in the way that they are treated, because just throwing them all in prison, for instance, as the UK did with all German residents in the beginning of World War Two, is not going to work, or indeed enhance our own democratic reputation.

"On the other hand, there does come a tipping point towards war when individual interests are to some degree going to be affected or subsumed by just being a citizen of the country concerned.

"It seems that these regulations are effectively preparing the ground for this to happen. I support these proposals, and feel that ultimately in the circumstances presented they are appropriate."

Liberal Democrat Layla Moran said: "While so far we may have talked the talk, I'm afraid to say today's list of sanctions were gruel. I don't think that they've done anything. I don't even think there is a line in the sand there."

The MP for Oxford West and Abingdon told the Commons she welcomed the sanctions but she wants the Government "to do so much more than it's done today".

She spoke of the need to tackle "Putin's cronies" and also used her parliamentary privilege to name 35 people she said were on a list of "key enablers" compiled by Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and his team over a year ago.

US President Joe Biden has announced his own sanctions against Russia.

In a statement from the White House, Mr Biden said the measures were only the "first tranche" and he would "escalate sanctions if Russia escalates".

He said: "We're implementing full blocking sanctions on two large Russian financial institutions, VEB and their military bank.

"We're implementing comprehensive sanctions on Russian sovereign debt. That means we've cut off Russia's government from Western financing, it can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or European markets either."

He said: "Starting tomorrow and continuing in the days ahead we will also impose sanctions on Russia's elites and their family members. They share in the corrupt gains of the Kremlin policies and should share in the pain as well."

Mr Biden said the US had worked with Germany in the halting of Nordstream 2, and he added: "As Russia contemplates its next move, we have our next move prepared as well. Russia will pay an even steeper price if it continues its aggression, including additional sanctions."

Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said sanctions will be ratcheted up because of "what has already happened" and not just in response to "what might happen in the future".

Speaking in the Commons, Mr Cleverly told MPs: "I can confidently inform the House that they are demanding of the Government something which the Government is absolutely determined to do. You are pushing at an open door."

The Foreign Office minister added: "The question that was asked is, 'are these sanctions only going to be escalated in response to further aggression?'

"I can assure this House that these sanctions will be ratcheted up because of what has already happened, not just in response to what might happen in the future. Our intention, as I say, is to prevent even further invasion of Ukraine, to have those troops that are currently in Ukraine removed and then have them returned to their own barracks once they are back in Russia."

US President Joe Biden said the US would also continue to provide "defensive assistance" to Ukraine, and he had authorised the movement of US forces to other Baltic states.

He told a press briefing: "In response to Russia's admission that it will not withdraw its forces from Belarus, I have authorised additional movements of US forces and equipment already stationed in Europe to strengthen our Baltic allies - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

"Let me be clear, these are totally defensive moves on our part. We have no intention of fighting Russia.

"We want to send an unmistakable message though, that the United States together with our allies will defend every inch of Nato territory and abide by the commitments we made into Nato."

Joe Biden said he expected the Kremlin to start a war and that "none of us should be fooled".

The US President told reporters: "We still believe that Russia is poised to go much further in launching a massive military attack against Ukraine."

He said: "There are still well over 150,000 Russian troops surrounding Ukraine, and as I said, Russian forces remain positioned to Belarus to attack Ukraine from the north, including warplanes and offensive missile systems.

"Russia's moved troops closer to Ukraine's border with Russia.

"Russia's naval vessels are manoeuvring in the Black Sea to Ukraine's south including amphibious assault ships, missile cruisers, and submarines.

"Russia has moved supplies of blood and medical equipment into position on their border. You don't need blood unless you plan on starting a war."

(Corrected repetition, amends incorrect word in par four)

President Joe Biden has said the world has heard "the full extent of Vladimir Putin's twisted rewrite of history" but added the US is still "open to diplomacy".

Speaking at a White House briefing on the Ukraine crisis, said he had been in "constant contact" with European leaders on how to respond "in unison" to any threat from Russia.

"Yesterday the world heard clearly the full extent of Vladimir Putin's twisted rewrite of history," he said.

"Nothing in Putin's remarks indicate any interest in pursuing real dialogue in European security in the year 2022. He directly attacked Ukraine's right to exist."

However, Mr Biden added that there was still a chance to "avert the worst-case scenario" which would "bring untold suffering to millions of people".

"The United States and our allies remain open to diplomacy, if it is serious," Mr Biden said. "But when all is said and done, we're going to judge Russia by its actions, not its words, and whatever Russia does next we're ready to respond with unity, clarity and conviction."

Speaking in Parliament, former Nato secretary-general Lord Robertson of Port Ellen said he backed the Government and "the resolution of the West against this unprovoked attack on an individual nation state".

He said: "It is outrageous and we are at a very dangerous point in European history."

The Labour former defence secretary told the House of Lords: "Can I suggest to the Government that we need to do much more to answer some of the disinformation now being put out by the Russians? For example, President (Vladimir) Putin tries to pretend that he has had nothing to do with agreements regarding the sovereignty of Ukraine.

"But in 2002 Vladimir Putin signed the Rome Declaration... which said the participating states respect sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all states and their inherent right to choose the means to ensure their own security and the inviolability of borders.

"That was signed up to by Vladimir Putin 20 years ago and now he seems to pretend that Ukraine does not exist.

"Surely we need to do much more to counter some of the lies coming out. Because the battle of narratives is going to matter just as much as the battle of the military on the ground."

Tory former solicitor general and QC Lord Garnier said the imposition of sanctions by the UK against three billionaire allies of Vladimir Putin and five Russian banks over Ukraine "really isn't enough".

Speaking in the Lords, Conservative peer: "Kleptocrats like drug dealers really do not like having their money, their ill-gotten gains, removed from them.

"We have sanctioned three individuals and five banks, that really isn't enough.

"President Putin has vast sums squirreled away in the West, held by nominees. The Government must know who these nominees are and may I suggest that the Government speedily sanctions all those whom it knows to be doing President Putin's work."

Responding, Tory Lords leader Baroness Evans of Bowes Park said: "The sanctions announced today are only the first tranche and we will step sanctions if Russian aggression continues."

Former head of the Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service Lord McDonald of Salford said, to be effective, sanctions imposed on Moscow "have to be international and coordinated".

He told the upper chamber: "This needs to be an international effort which usually would be coordinated through the United Nations. The security council clearly is not available as the Russians have a veto.

"In what international forum will the Government coordinate the necessary sanctions effort?"

Tory Lords leader Baroness Evans of Bowes Park said the Government had been working with allies through Nato, the UN and G7 as well as having bilateral meetings.

"We are working internationally and we are coordinating our response with our allies and partners," she said.

Former Navy chief Lord West of Spithead has said the UK and US should be preparing to make Vladimir Putin's "eyes water" over Ukraine, arguing the allies had superior cyber capability in the GCHQ and the National Security Agency.

The Labour peer, a member of Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, said: "We can run rings around the Russians if we really want to. We should be getting ready to do that... to really make his eyes water so he knows what he's done."

He told the Lords: "We mustn't delude ourselves, Russia has invaded Ukraine."

Referring to the Russian leader, Lord West said: "He's made a calculation the pain isn't that much and I have to say at the moment I would rather agree with him. He's not getting that much pain.

He added: "Since 2010 we have reduced our military by a third. That has not gone unnoticed."

Independent crossbench peer Lord Skidelsky, who until last month was a director of oil refining firm Russneft, said the lack of understanding of Russia's position was "absolutely appalling".

He told the Lords: "Will the Government urgently and imaginatively search for a diplomatic agreement on the Ukraine problem?

"The lack of imagination and lack of understanding of Russia's position is absolutely appalling in my view and very depressing.

"The atmosphere of the House reminds me very, very much of 2003 prior to the invasion of Iraq."

But disagreeing, Conservative Lords leader Baroness Evans of Bowes Park said: "Russia has been falsely accusing Russia of provocation and nothing could be further from the truth.

"Nato has always been a defensive alliance and poses no threat to Russia.

"Nato allies remain committed to a dual track approach, strong deterrents and defence combined with meaningful dialogue, but Russia has to stop its aggression towards Ukraine."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Britain will "use every lever at our disposal to stop (Vladimir Putin) in his tracks".

Writing in The Times, Ms Truss said: "Time after time, we and our allies have said that any further invasion would have severe consequences. Now Russia has chosen to abandon diplomacy, we have a moral duty to stand with Ukraine and demonstrate that we mean what we say.

"We have put in place our toughest sanctions regime against Russia. Nothing is off the table."

Ms Truss said she had held a call with G7 allies to "agree the next package".

"We are looking at sanctioning members of the Russian Duma and Federation Council. And we will extend the territorial sanctions imposed on Crimea to the separatist-controlled territories in the Donbas," she said.

"We have a long list of those complicit in the actions of the Russian leadership. Should Russia refuse to pull back its troops we can keep turning up the heat, targeting more banks, elites and companies of significance."

She added: "In time, even those close to President Putin will come to see his decisions this week as a self-inflicted wound."

President Vladimir Putin has appeared in a video address after ordering Russian forces into two rebels regions in eastern Ukraine, sparking fears of all-out war.

Around 10,000 Russian troops have entered the breakaway territories of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine – known collectively as the Donbas region — while Russian authorities have denied Ukraine’s right to sovereignty.

In the video, Putin says he is ready for “diplomatic solutions” surrounding the crisis but Russia’s interests are “non-negotiable”.

The EU has called for sanctions to be extended to Belarus, after new satellite images revealed new Russian military build-up on its soil, just 40km north of the Ukrainian border.

The Ukrainian government made a number of announcements on Wednesday, including the drafting of army reservists aged 18-60.

Ukrainian civilians have also been given the right to carry firearms and defend themselves, after the country‘s parliament voted in favour of the emergency measure.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison addressed the nation to reveal Australia’s response to the crisis, including a string of fresh sanctions.

Vladimir Putin appears in new message

President Putin has appeared in a video message to celebrate a Russian public holiday — Fatherland Day.

In a long message to Russians, where he bragged, “we have weapons that are second to none in the world and they are operational”, Mr Putin said the Kremlin is open to “honest dialogue” but warned “the interests of Russia are non-negotiable”.

“Comrade officers,” he said.

“Ensuring that our country can defend itself remains a primary responsibility of government, and the Armed Forces serve as a reliable guarantee of our national security, the peaceful and orderly lives of our people and Russia’s stable and steady development.

“We can see the difficult international situation and the threats posed by current challenges, such as the erosion of the arms control system and NATO’s military activities.

“And yet, Russia’s appeals to build a system of equal and indivisible security that would reliably defend all countries, remain unanswered.

“Our country is always open to a direct and honest dialogue and ready to search for diplomatic solutions to the most complicated issues.

“But I want to repeat that Russia’s interests and the security of our people are an indisputable priority. So, we will continue to strengthen and modernise our Army and Navy, striving to increase their effectiveness, so they are fitted out with the most cutting-edge equipment.

“We will continue to develop promising weapon systems, including hypersonic weapons and those based on new physical principles, and expand the use of advanced digital technology and elements of artificial intelligence. Complexes like these are weapons of the future, which can boost the potential of our Armed Forces several-fold.

“As Supreme Commander-in-Chief, I have confidence in you, Russian soldiers and officers, in your high professionalism, bravery and reliability, that you will guard the peace of our people, and stand up for the national interests of our great country.

“I wish you good health and every success in your service. I want to extend the best wishes to your families and friends.

“Again, my sincere greetings to you on this holiday.”

Ukraine to announce state to emergency

Ukraine is set to annouce a state of emergy as it urged its three million citizens living in Russia to leave the country immediately.

The state of emergency is expected to last approximately 30 days after Ukraine’s security council approved the plan in response to Russia’s advance.

The move must be formally approved by parliament before coming into effect.

Russia began evacuating diplomatic staff from Ukraine, its embassy in Kyiv told AFP, a day after lawmakers in Moscow granted President Vladimir Putin to use force abroad.

Asked if the evacuation had begun, the embassy’s spokesman Denis Golenko told AFP by phone: “Yes.”

Moscow’s foreign ministry announced Tuesday it would evacuate diplomats from the country soon.

Russian ambassador hauled into Canberra meeting

Russia’s ambassador to Australia has been hauled to Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and TradeAustralia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade office.

Alexey Pavlovsky was pictured entering the Canberra building and was inside speaking with the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Defence and Trade Kathryn Campbell for approximately half an hour as Russian troops entered breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.

He avoided the media as he left but the Prime Minister hasn’t ruled out kicking Mr Pavlovsky out of the country.

“We haven’t taken that step,” Mr Morrison said.

“Other countries, and I’ve discussed this with other leaders, they haven’t taken those decisions as yet. But we will see where this proceeds.”

New photos reveal scale of Russia’s ‘invasion’ plans

Newly-released satellite pictures have revealed the extent of Russia’s planned “invasion” of Ukraine.

One of the images, from Maxar Technologies, show a deployment of forces and vehicles in Belarus, north of the border with Ukraine.

Another shows masses of troops in Pochep, western Russia, while a third reveals a new deployment, material support and troops gathered near Belgorod, Russia.

EU’s foreign affairs chief Josep Borrel called for sanctions to be extended to Belarus if an attack is launched by Russian troops from its soil.

“I want to repeat once again that any further aggression against Ukraine will have a strong answer from the European Union,” Mr Borrell said in Brussels following a 10-hour meeting with 27 foreign ministers.

Lithuania’s foreign affairs minister Gabrielius Landsbergis claimed some of the Belarusian armed forces were taking orders from Russia

“Belarusian troops are receiving their commands now more and more from the Russian political decision-makers … and that means that there’s low, very low, levels of independence in the Belarusian army,” he said.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has previously said it is “clear whose side Belarus will be on” if war breaks out in the region.

Scott Morrison speaks with Ukrainian PM

Scott Morrison and Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal spoke by phone this evening to discuss the developing situation, after the Prime Minister announced sanctions against Russia.

“Prime Minister Morrison reaffirmed Australia’s unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and denounced Russia’s aggressive behaviour towards Ukraine as unacceptable, unprovoked and unwarranted,” a spokesman said.

“The Prime Minister informed Prime Minister Shmyhal of Australia’s immediate action to sanction Russian individuals, organisations and banks as part of an international effort to impose a sharp cost on Russia for its actions against Ukraine.

“The Prime Minister affirmed Australia’s preparedness to do more, working with our partners, and in response to Ukraine’s needs.”

Australian sanctions revealed

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has confirmed there will be travel bans and financial sanctions against eight individuals linked to Russia’s national security council, with restrictions also placed on the transport, energy, telecommunications and oil gas and mineral reserves industries in the rebel regions.

He added sanctions would also be rolled out against Russian banks as part of a “first tranche” of sanctions, and said Australia’s response was designed to be “in lock-step” with the US.

The sanctions will include “travel bans and targeted financial sanctions” to “ensure we can target those … who are aiding and abetting this invasion”.

He said Russia’s acts had “no validity under international law” and that “we won’t hesitate to take further action”.

“It’s included to capture persons and entities of what is termed ‘strategic and economic significance to Russia’ and so that gives us a broad coverage to ensure that we can target those who are particularly involved in these actions and who are aiding and abetting this invasion.”

He said Australia had been stepping up its preparedness for potential cyber attacks

Mr Morrison confirmed that more than 400 Ukrainians have so far applied for temporary asylum in Australia, and that their applications would move to the “top of the pile”.

Opposition Labor Anthony Albanese offered bipartisan support for the sanctions on Russian, saying “Australians stand as one”.

Full-scale invasion ‘in 24 hours’: PM

Mr Morrison has confirmed that while the invasion of Ukraine had already begun, a full-scale invasion would occur within the next “24 hours”.

“The invasion of Ukraine has effectively already begun,’’ he said.

“As President Biden has also remarked, the invasion is unjustified. It’s unwarranted. It’s unprovoked. and it’s unacceptable.”

He added that while the invasion would ramp up within hours, “there are even reports already of shelling and things of that nature, which could indicate that it has already begun”.

But Mr Morrison stressed that: “Australians always stand up to bullies and we will be standing up to Russia, along with all of our partners … and all of those who believe that it’s absolutely unacceptable that Russia could invade its neighbour and seek to extract some concessions or advantage out of threats of terrible violence upon its neighbour.”

He added that “there must be consequences” for Russia’s behaviour, accusing Russian authorities of acting like “bullies and thugs”.

UK sanctions designed to ‘inflict pain’ on Russia

UK foreign secretary Liz Truss has endorsed her government’s sanctions against Russia, warning the “tepid response” is the “toughest sanctions regimen we have ever put in place” against the nation.

When asked if Russian political donors to the UK would be included in the sanctions, Mrs Truss said “nothing is off the table in terms of who we‘re targeting”.

She said the UK’s initial response was to “inflict pain” on Russia as it advances into Ukraine, warning more action will be taken if President Vladimir Putin persists.

She warned it was “highly likely” Putin will ”follow through on his plan for full-scale invasion”.

“We have not yet seen a full-scale invasion but we are very clear that if President Putin escalates, we the international community will escalate our sanctions,” she said.

‘One last chance’: Russia’s grim threat

Vladimir Putin brutally mocked his own spy chief, urging the senior official to “speak plainly” during a televised meeting on Monday.

The clash came as Mr Putin appeared to grow frustrated by Director of Foreign Intelligence Sergey Naryshkin’s failure to adequately support Russia’s move to recognise Ukraine’s pro-Russian breakaway regions.

But while much of the attention so far has been on Putin’s humiliation of Mr Naryshkin, one of his comments have revealed Russia’s grim threat to the West before an “invasion” of Ukraine.

“With the suggestion of Nikolai Platonovich, that we could give our, how to say it, Western partners, one last chance,” Mr Naryshkin said.

“Presenting them with the choice, in the shortest time frame, to force Kyiv to choose peace and implement the Minsk agreements

“In the worst case, we must make the decision that we are discussing today.”

“What does it mean, ‘in the worst case’? Are you suggesting we start negotiations?” Mr Putin fired back.

“Or to recognise sovereignty?”

Mr Naryshkin stuttered as he tried to respond, prompting Mr Putin to demand he “speak, speak, speak plainly!”

“I support the proposal about the entry of the Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples’ Republics into the Russian Federation,” Mr Naryshkin replied.

“We’re not talking about that,” Mr Putin shot back. “We’re not discussing that. We’re talking about recognising their independence or not.”

“Yes,” Mr Naryshkin eventually confirmed.

“I support their proposal for independence.”

Fears for Australia after new sanctions announced

Concerns are growing that Australia could face Russian cyber attacks in response to new sanctions imposed as a result of the Ukraine crisis.

Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews warned that the nation’s “critical infrastructure” could be a target.

“We are concerned about protecting Australia’s interests and we are concerned about the potential for a cyber attack on our critical infrastructure,” she said.

“Now, that doesn’t mean we are going to go lightly in our response to Russia because their behaviour needs to be called out.”

It’s expected that PM Scott Morrison will announce additional financial sanctions in a 12.45pm address following today’s National Security Committee meeting.

We’ll bring you all the updates here.

Russia’s new threat as ‘invasion’ begins

Any hopes of avoiding war in Europe are fading fast as Russia vows it won’t stop the “invasion” of Ukraine, denying the neighbouring country‘s right to exist.

The provocative warning comes amid a huge language shift among world leaders, who now confirm the situation in Ukraine is an invasion and that the threat of all-out war is rising fast.

Around 10,000 troops and tanks and equipment have already moved into the two pro-Russian rebel Ukrainian territories of Luhansk and Donetsk after Mr Putin yesterday recognised them as separate entities.

Russia’s parliament voted to allow the use of armed forces outside Russia while President Putin declared he wanted to see “demilitarisation” in Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced that Russia now recognised the breakaway regions in borders which existed when they declared their independence back in 2014, including parts of eastern Ukraine on the other side of the so-called “contact line” between the two nations.

NED-5555-Putins-Terminator-tanks

Mr Putin also said Russia recognised Donetsk and Luhansk “within borders outlined in their constitutions”, while Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia did not recognise its democratic neighbour’s right to sovereignty in what has been seen as a major hint that war was looming.

Mr Lavrov justified his comments by arguing that sovereignty was only the right of nations that represented their entire populations, alleging Kyiv had failed ethnic Russians.

“Nobody can assert that the Ukrainian regimen, starting with the state coup of 2014, represents all the people who live on the territory of the Ukrainian state,” he said.

The language used by Mr Putin and Mr Lavrov have been seen as confirmation Moscow would not back down in its “invasion” of Ukraine.

Ukraine’s reservists called in

Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced he has called up army reservists to assist as the situation with Russia escalates.

“There is no need for general mobilisation today. We need to promptly replenish the Ukrainian army and other military formations,” he said.

“As the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, I issued a decree on the conscription of reservists during a special period.

“We must increase the readiness of the Ukrainian army for all possible changes in the operational situation.”

Ukraine’s desperate plan to defeat Russia

Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has revealed Ukraine’s two plans in the fight to protect its territory from Russian invasion.

“We have two plans,” Mr Kuleba said in today’s press conference.

“Plan A is to utilise every tool of diplomacy to deter Russia and prevent further escalation. “And if that fails, Plan B is to fight for every inch of our land, and every city and every village.

“Then, to fight until we win, of course.”

UN slams Russia

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has fronted the press in New York in light of the Ukraine situation, slamming Russia’s provocative decision to recognise the rebel regions.

“Let me be clear. The decision of the Russian Federation to recognise the so-called independence of certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions is a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine,” he said.

Mr Guterres also lashed Russia’s claim troops were in the regions for \"peacekeeping” purposes.

“When troops of one country enter the territory of another country without its consent, they are not impartial peacekeepers,” he said.

“They are not peacekeepers at all.”

World on ‘edge of the largest catastrophe since World War II’.

Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has also held a joint press conference with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, slamming the “unprovoked and unjustified war on another sovereign state in Europe which Russia now intensifies”.

“We all are at a critical juncture for the security of Europe as well as international peace and security more broadly,” he said.

“Russian aggression has brought the world to the edge of the largest catastrophe since World War II.

“Yesterday, President Putin moved to recognise two pieces of Ukrainian land as independent entities.

“Ukraine does not and will never recognise this absurdity, neither will the world recognise it.”

Mr Kuleba also had some strong words for those who hesitated to describe the crisis as an invasion.

“There’s no such thing as a minor, middle or major invasion. Invasion is an invasion,” Mr Kuleba said.

Expert says Russian sanctions doomed to fail

Hugh White, a professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University, told ABC News Breakfast on Wednesday that sanctions imposed against Russia would be all but useless.

“When a country as powerful as Russia, and it does remain a powerful country militarily, decides to move to armed force, really only armed force can respond and I think the fact is that Putin is now asking the rest of the world to choose between a Ukraine which is allowed to join NATO on the one hand, what the West wants, or a Ukraine which is steadily dismantled by Putin as he increasingly puts military pressure on it,” he said.

“What I think what we have seen today is quite possibly just the first step of a broader serving of incursions in the country.

“We’re brought face-to-face, if you like, with the reality that the rules-based order we all hoped to see emerge in the world after the Cold War, really does still find itself subject to the harsh realities of power and in Ukraine, in eastern Europe, the harsh reality of power goes Putin’s way.”

Ukraine shelled 80 times in 24 hours

Ukraine’s Defence Ministry has claimed Ukrainian territories were shelled a staggering 80 times in just 24 hours from the breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.

In a statement, the ministry confirmed 58 of those incidents were from weapons which are specifically banned under the Minsk agreements – a ceasefire pact hashed out in 2014 and 2015.

However, Mr Putin has stated that the Minsk accord “no longer exists”.

At least one fatality has been recorded in Ukraine so far, as well as a handful of injuries.

She has also called for all remaining Australians in Ukraine – believed to be around 100 – to leave immediately.

Biden’s sanctions revealed

US President Joe Biden spoke earlier, describing the crisis as “the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine”.

He also announced a slew of severe new sanctions against Russia.

“We’re implementing full blocking sanctions on two large Russian financial institutions: VEB and their military bank,” he said.

“We’re implementing comprehensive sanctions on Russia’s sovereign debt. That means we’ve cut off Russia’s government from Western financing. It can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or European markets either.

“We’ll also impose sanctions on Russia’s elites and their family members. They share in the corrupt gains of the Kremlin policies and should share in the pain as well.

“We’ve worked with Germany to ensure that Nord Stream 2 will not … move forward.”

Mr Biden said if Moscow “continues its aggression” there could be tougher sanctions to come.

Russia has ‘now undeniably moved against Ukraine’: Biden

US President Joe Biden has condemned Vladimir Putin and announced a slew of sanctions in a fiery address this morning.

A clearly angry Mr Biden stated that Moscow had “now undeniably moved against Ukraine” after Mr Putin “bizarrely asserted that these (two breakaway) regions are no longer part of Ukraine and their sovereign territory”.

“To put it simply, Russia just announced that it is carving out a big chunk of Ukraine,” he said.

“Last night, Putin authorised Russian forces to deploy into this region, today he asserted these regions are actually extending deeper than the two areas he recognised.

“He is setting up a rationale to take more territory by force in my view … he’s setting up a rationale to go much further. This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine as he indicated.”

Mr Biden said tough sanctions would be imposed “far beyond the steps we and our allies and partners implemented in 2014”.

They will include severe economic measures, which will target Russia’s financial institutions as well as members of Mr Putin’s inner posse.

“If Russia goes further with this invasion, we stand prepared to go further with sanctions,” he said.

“Who in the Lord’s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belonged to his neighbours?

“This is a flagrant violation of international law.”

Russia’s move described as an ‘invasion’

US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin described Russia’s military intervention as an “invasion”.

Mr Austin said the “latest invasion” of Ukraine was “threatening the peace and security and prosperity of Ukraine, and of the transatlantic community,” and that the US would impose additional “severe economic costs as events dictate.”

Mr Biden’s deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told CNN, “an invasion is an invasion, and that is what is underway.”

“Russia has been invading Ukraine since 2014 … I am calling it an invasion.”

ANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news.

ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Alisyn Camerota. Welcome to CNN NEWSROOM.

VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN HOST: I'm Victor Blackwell.

Erin Burnett is in Lviv, Ukraine.

Erin, we just heard from President Biden, announcing new sanctions. You are there. What are you seeing?

ERIN BURNETT, CNN ANCHOR: All right, I'll tell you what we're learning right now just actually in this moment.

Here in Lviv, where I am, in western Ukraine, as you know, military bases near here were struck early this morning.

The city is saying at 11:00 p.m., about 90 minutes from now, they'll turn off the streetlights here, all building illuminations.

And they're also asking anyone who lives here to turn off the lights in their homes. They're making it very clear that this is for preventive measures.

I know just over the past, you know, two weeks, talking to you guys every day, there's a big tower behind me. It's a communications tower. It is not illuminated now. It's at the top of the tallest hill in the city. But that's what they're saying.

As you can see behind me -- I'm making sure you can see -- obviously, there's light in the city. All of that, we're told, is going to go off at 11:00 p.m. As I said, in about 90 minutes in a country that is very much on edge.

You have clashes going on right now in the east of this country, in the north of this country, in the south of this country as we speak.

It's night. Again, the fears of more potential strikes. Nobody knows what is next.

As you all know, it comes as President Biden called Vladimir Putin a bully for launching war here in Ukraine and Europe and for destroying peace in a place that held here since World War II.

After months of denials and lies, Putin invaded Ukraine by land, by air, and by sea. More than 100 missiles starting in the early morning hours.

President Biden, moments ago, issuing new, what he calls, severe sanctions against Russia, including family members of elites.

We don't know yet who they are. That's very important. And right now, not yet, against Putin himself.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. Now he and his country will bear the consequences.

We have purposefully designed these sanctions to maximize a long-term impact on Russia and to minimize the impact of the United States and our allies.

This aggression cannot go unanswered. If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse.

America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BURNETT: Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs reports nearly 400 instances of shelling by Russian forces in Ukraine today.

Ukrainian officials said at least 40 have been killed. Most of them in the military. I must say, though, we're very much in the fog of war. No one knows the real numbers.

We do know Ukrainian are using subway stations as bomb shelters in Kharkiv in the east of this country.

They've been putting a run on ATMs for cash. It's the only place today, in fact, where we have seen any groups of people. You see a group, you know it's an ATM.

Clogging major roads to flee from the war that NATO's leader calls brutal and reckless and unprovoked.

I want to go now to CNN's Scott McLean.

When we talk about people fleeing, that is live on the Poland/Ukrainian border where Ukrainians are crossing.

Scott, one of the most powerful images today was seeing rows and rows of completely blocked highways of people leaving Kyiv and heading west. Many of them leaving the country, their own country for their safety.

Tell me what you're seeing.

SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Erin. Let me set the scene. We're in the town of Madika. It's not very big, maybe a few thousand people. It's a border town. There's been a steady stream of people coming out.

So this pathway you're seeing people come up is a pedestrian crossing. As you can see where it's illuminated, that's the actual border crossing.

What we've seen since we've been here for the last few hours is a lot of families coming out here.

And the reason why you don't see more people, Erin, is because we are told by many people that we have spoken to that there's a backlog on the other side.

People are having to wait six, seven, nine hours outdoors to cross the border. Again, they have children and it's right around freezing right now.

[14:35:03]

Let me show you what else we're seeing. There's a whole bunch of people in this area because they have to figure out where to go once they actually get here.

A lot of them are milling about with their suitcases trying to arrange taxis and trying to arrange a ride.

There's buses here, as well, taking people to nearby towns. That one is going to a city maybe less than an hour from here.

You also have -- sorry. Here is another family who just arrived here.

Do you speak English?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

MCLEAN: Where did you come from?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

MCLEAN: People are just trying to figure out where they're trying to go now.

Honestly, Erin, many people we've spoken to -- let me take you around the other way. You can see there seems to a lot more volume of people coming in.

A lot of people we have spoken to, Erin, frankly, they don't know exactly where they're going to go. They're trying to figure out a hotel. They're trying to figure out some kind of accommodation.

Other people are trying to get to Warsaw to try to get to the airport, as well.

We know that the Polish government has set up these sorts of welcome centers up-and-down the border. We're not exactly sure where the welcome center is in this area. It's not well advertised.

What you don't see in this area is any kind of organized aid. You don't see UNHCR. You don't see police. You don't see really any helpers try to assist people, which is really remarkable.

Sorry, I'll get out of the way. People are trying to get on the bus as it's going to the town nearby.

Again, it's a bit chaotic in this area, frankly, Erin.

Again, it breaks your heart to see children, especially, you know, having to wait in the cold and not knowing where they're going.

Most of the people we have spoken to, as well, they don't think they'll be gone for long or perhaps they're hopeful they're not gone for long.

You know, maybe they think they'll be gone for a week or so. Then they'll be able to go back.

There's also been a remarkable, well, maybe not remarkable, but a surprising number of people going the other way, back into Ukraine.

I spoke to one woman earlier today who is a Ukrainian living here in Poland. Not too far from the border.

She went back in because she said she simply could not stay home. She just wanted to do something. So she ended up ferrying people to train stations to try to assist them in getting out.

Another woman actually is a Ukrainian living in London. About a week ago, she went to visit her mother, thinking there's no way there's going to be an attack.

Obviously, well she was very wrong. Now she was fleeing today with her child and, also, with her mother, as well.

Virtually, everyone we have spoken to is united in the fact that they did not see this coming.

Many Ukrainians simply thought it was a bluff by Vladimir Putin. Perhaps there would be some military action going on in the east of the country.

But it seems like nobody expected what we're seeing here today in terms of the bombing and shelling and the things you're seeing inside of the country -- Erin?

BURNETT: Yes. That's what we've seen here, as well. People heard the intelligence. They knew the intelligence. They simply did not believe that such an incomprehensible and counter-factual thing could happen. Yet here we are. Thank you very much, Scott.

I want to go to Nick Paton Walsh. He is in southern Ukraine. That's where President Zelensky said some of the worst fighting is going on.

Nick, it's one of the things, as we're talking about it, sometimes it's near people on our team. Sometimes it isn't. But the fighting is happening. It's happening as we speak.

What are you seeing? What do you understand is happening near where you are?

NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR: Yes, I'm in the Black Sea coast. It's had an awful day, frankly.

We didn't see as we came into this vital city of Kherson, we heard quite a lot of explosions.

And some gunfire toward a key bridge that the Russians possibly have pushed over to get on to this, the Kyiv essentially, sort of northern side of the Dnieper River that runs through Ukraine.

They pushed out this morning, it seems, from Crimea, which has for the last eight years, been held illegally by Russia after the annexation in 2014.

They appeared to have got to the other side of the bridge here near this town where I'm standing, Kherson. Then an extensive fire fight occurred for control of a bridge.

When we got here, we heard the gunfire and the violence, it seemed, on this side of the river, essentially, about eight kilometers east in this town city, on its outskirts.

The question we're asking ourselves now, obviously, is some of their ambitions to cross the bridge and moving on?

President Zelensky seemed to think their goals from taking this part of territory and the hydroelectric power station. But we also learned they have fallen in their hands. And a further area to the east, as well.

[14:40:08]

But they may be trying to move eastward toward essentially the separatist areas on the outer Azov Sea coast. That's unclear.

What we don't know is whether Kherson is potentially a target for the advancing forces or they're essentially moving on through.

It's eerie here, frankly, shut down. A lot of the lights are off. It's very quiet.

As of now, unclear if that's a lull or what we're going to see next or if it's essentially a route for the Russian forces heading west to where we were this morning out in Odessa, Ukraine's third-largest city -- Erin?

BURNETT: All right, Nick, thank you very much.

You can see how dark it is. He's talking about the loss of light. That's what we'll be seeing that here in just over an hour. All of the lights will go off. They're asking everyone to turn them off at home as well.

So when you say, how much Russian forces are in the country, what are they doing, how many tanks, where is the fighting?

The person with the best eyes on the ground on this is Frederick Pleitgen, because he's live on the Russian side of the border near the city of Belgorod.

Fred, I want to the give everyone a sense here, Fred, you've been watching the convoys for days. Then you watched them file through.

You have a sense of the scale and the scope and how long it continued and how many have been coming in from where you are. You've seen artillery rockets from Russia being fired into Ukraine throughout as the convoys went.

What are you seeing right now?

FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Erin, essentially, what we've been seeing and continue to see, at the last border crossing toward Ukraine, toward the city of Kharkiv, the Kharkiv frontline, you said it correctly, a steady stream of Russian forces moving across there.

It's quite interesting because some of them are armored convoys. You have a lot of fighting vehicles going across. Of course, the very important for the Russian campaign.

But then, also, larger vehicles, as well. We saw main battle tanks.

One interesting thing we thought, the main battle tanks, we saw them go past us, their tracks were full of mud. They must have been dug in some position close to where we were. And they had come out and took the main road into Kharkiv.

That seems to have possibly indicate maybe the Russians made some headway in Kharkiv and moving the front line further into Ukrainian territory.

Then we also saw some pretty heavy Howitzers, as well. They can cause a lot of damage. Those shells are very heavy.

And especially if they're used in civilian areas. That, obviously, would be something that would be completely devastating. We did see a lot of those.

But one of the things that stood out is the fact we saw those artillery rockets being fired from the position that we were at. It happened at various occasions throughout the day that salvos were fired.

Those artillery rockets have a pretty long range. They're not necessarily the most accurate weapons that the Russians have. They can do a lot of damage and they are certainly feared, as well.

So from our vantage point, what we can see, Erin, the offensive is extremely large scale. We've seen Russian troops go in there pretty much throughout the entire day. It's out in a large area.

And it certainly shows absolutely no signs of slowing down -- Erin?

BURNETT: All right. Thank you very much, Fred.

Just an incredible sense of scale, as he said. No signs of slowing down and still just coming in more and more and more into this country.

If you need to ask yourself, is it over? Is this all he's going to do? You have your answer. The answer is no. They're here.

President Biden just imposed additional sanctions on Russia in response, as they said they would do. They have ramped them up in his restricting the country's banks, banning technology exports.

Let's go to our chief White House correspondent, Kaitlan Collins.

Kaitlan, Biden also said there's going to be new sanctions targeting Russian elites with close ties to Vladimir Putin. He said we'll learn more in the coming days.

Obviously, it's a key part of the sanctions plan. We don't yet have more details yet, do we?

KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, they have released the name was of the Russian elites. This is coming from the Treasury Department, of course, in charge of the sanctions.

It will -- basically, the main extent of these sanctions that President Biden announced today that the White House has been talking about, for some time now, are going after Russian banks, going after Russian elites, and adding more of them to the sanctions list.

Also, going after technology exports. These will affect things like Russia's military capabilities when it comes to things like lasers, sensors, semiconductor chips.

Those are the nature of the sanctions they're going after Russia with.

What President Biden was talking about there, when he was laying out the consequences he said Russia is going to bear, is they will take some time to take effect.

They're not as immediate, as you could see other measures go into effect. So it will take time.

President Biden was arguing he does believe, over time, it will weaken Russia and these sanctions will be effective.

[14:44:59]

One argument he did make, which is notable, given what White House aids and top national security officials have been saying for several weeks, is he didn't believe the sanctions were going to stop Putin from going forward to do what he did.

We've talked about them being a deterrence, as the White House felt they wanted to wait until Putin actually went in and attacked Ukraine to put these sanctions in place, as they're doing today.

Erin, one other thing we should note the Treasury Department announced is they'll be sanctioning a list of individuals from Belarus, including the defense minister, which is notable, for helping Ukraine or helping Russia with the invasion into Ukraine.

Last night, as the attack was happening, we know there were reports on the ground of the Russian forces coming in from the border with Belarus.

Now they have a list of individuals, I believe it's about 24 of them who are now also being sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department.

The larger scale of this, of course, is what the sanctions will actually do.

The question has been, how effective can they be in deterring someone like Putin, who seems dead set on doing what he wants to do and rebuilding the Soviet Empire, as President Biden said, is his main goal.

That's something President Biden talked about just a few moments ago.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BIDEN: The threat of the sanctions and imposing the sanctions and seeing the effect of the sanctions are two different things.

(CROSSTALK)

BIDEN: They're two different things. We're going to -- he's going to begin to see the effect of the sanctions.

COLLINS: And what will that do -- how will it change his mindset here, given he's --

(CROSSTALK)

BIDEN: It will weaken his country. He'll have to make a very, very difficult choice as to whether to continue to move toward being a second-rate power or, in fact, respond.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

COLLINS: There, President Biden saying what he believed would happen to Russia if he continued to move forward with this.

One chilling thing he said also, Erin, is he believes President Putin has his sights are set much higher than just Ukraine, saying he's intent on rebuilding the Soviet Empire.

And raising questions where Putin can go from where he started last night.

BURNETT: Kaitlan, thank you very much.

And joining me now are CNN national security analyst Steve Hall. Of course, you know him, the former chief of Russian operations for CIA. And Ambassador Ivo Daalder. He is the former U.S. ambassador to NATO.

Thank you very much to both of you for your time.

Steve Hall, where do you think we are in this are right now in the context of, another night, the city is going to be dark across this country? As I said, we're about an hour from that. Formerly, we saw it in the south.

And convoys that just seem to be unrelenting still crossing the border from Russia into Ukraine.

STEVE HALL, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, Erin, I guess, a day or so ago, we had the luxury of wondering whether or not he was -- Putin, that is -- was just going to go into the Donbass under these strange artificial circumstances that Putin himself created and stop there.

That's clearly not going to happen. It's clearly much bigger than that.

And so we're beyond the part now where we say, well, are these threats of sanctions going to actually have an impact on Vladimir Putin? Clearly, they haven't.

And that was sort of what is going on, I think, in the press conference today. You had a lot of people asking, OK, now what?

It's clear Putin will go in and take, at the very least, the entire country of Ukraine. I suppose it's not clear whether he'll try to hold it like he has Crimea, just annexed it.

Or try to install some sort of public government, which is, in my view, probably more likely because it's perhaps less troublesome for Putin.

But there's a bigger question that now is laid at the world's doorstep. Which is, what do we do with a country that has simply flaunted the entire international system of rule of law?

And I think the answer is, well, we have to somehow contain them and make them, as the president said, a pariah state.

But where we are now is certainly very different from where we were 24, 48 hours ago.

And of course, you all on the ground in Ukraine know that much better than we do back here.

BURNETT: Ambassador, let me ask you about what the president said he did think was important. You know, that putting more supplies to NATO, more troops to bolster NATO. Making it clear U.S. troops will not fight Russia in Ukraine.

The NATO thing is great. It's only relevant if Putin goes beyond Ukraine, right? I suppose you can view it as a deterrent.

But it seemed like what the president was saying there was very clearly he felt that Vladimir Putin did intend to go farther than Ukraine.

I think that's sobering for anyone hearing it around the world. Is that what you heard?

IVO DAALDER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO: Yes, I think that is a risk that is clearly present now.

The massive scale of this invasion that you've all been observing and reporting on just demonstrates that this is not about a little part of Ukraine, and it really isn't about Ukraine.

It is about trying to figure out how to remake the current system of European security.

And it is our goal -- I think, as Steve rightly says, the need now is to focus on containing, containing and, ultimately, through containment, affect internal change in Russia.

[14:50:08]

It's the only way we won the Cold War. It's how we need to fight this new fight. Which is not for weeks or months. It will be years.

And the key components of that are the sanctions the president announced. I agree with those who say the more, the better, the quicker.

The second component is to support the Ukrainians as best they can, not only to people who are crossing the border, but the Ukrainian forces fighting inside.

Whether that is now to counter the invasion or, afterwards, to counter an occupation through an insurgency just to raise the cost for Russia.

And this finally, this really important issue of bolstering NATO and all of NATO.

I'm particularly concerned, if you look at the map and realize that Belarus and Russia are now a single military command zone.

There's a 60-kilometer border between Belarus and Kaliningrad, which, if the Russians were to take that -- of course, that means attacking Polish and/or Lithuanian territory.

But if they take that, you would cut off three Baltic States from the land corridor to NATO. That's what we need to prevent.

I think hopefully tomorrow, when the NATO summit or a virtual summit gets together, there's an agreement to deploy significant forces and significant tens of thousands of troops in this part of the region to prevent that.

BURNETT: Steve, today, I went to one of the military installations near Lviv here that was hit.

And one of the officers in the woods down a dirt road, they're not talking to the media, allowing the media on to the military installations.

But they did come out and speak to me. And they said they were hit by two rockets and they believe they came from Belarus.

Now I don't know whether they did or didn't. But we know a lot of things did come from Belarus. Belarus says it wasn't their soldiers but they are one with Russia.

Is it, at this point, essentially Belarus and Russia is just one place, is that a border with any distinction?

HALL: Certainly, in the context of Ukraine, and I would argue that probably not.

I mean, Lukashenko is essentially a lapdog of Putin on a very short leash. The Russian military can do pretty much whatever it wants and Lukashenko and the Belarusians won't do anything. And that's very useful for Putin.

But I think you also have to remember there's a price that the Belarusians pay. And there's certainly a price that the Russians will pay.

By taking this course of action, by going to war and invading a neighboring country, and then having the sanction that it will come down on Russia, Putin has essentially condemned Russia to be essentially a third-world country with nuclear weapons, sort of like maybe Pakistan or something like that.

If it works as it seems it's going to, because of the unity in the West, Russia will not have a lot of whole lot options beyond perhaps these military ones, which are not going to go that much further, I don't think.

BURNETT: It's interesting to see where it goes. I've been to Iran during the height of their sanctions. It does completely diminish a country from greatness. But it's unclear whether these will go anywhere near in that direction.

Thank you both so very much. I appreciate it. Steve Hall and Ambassador Ivo Daalder, thanks so much. So now let's send things back to you, Alisyn and Victor.

BLACKWELL: All right, Erin, thank you for that context.

[14:53:32]

President Biden just announced that thousands of additional U.S. troops will head to Europe to defend NATO territory. But he doubled down on his promise to not send troops into Ukraine. We've got new details ahead.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[14:58:27]

CAMEROTA: As Russian troops move into Ukraine, the Pentagon is deploying 7,000 U.S. troops to Europe and moving U.S. military assets further east.

That includes sending six F-35 fighter jets into the NATO nations of Estonia, Lithuania and Romania.

BLACKWELL: Let's bring in retired Lieutenant Colonel Cedric Leighton for more. He's a CNN military analyst and former member of the Joint Staff at the Pentagon.

Colonel, there have been reports of and explosions heard across the country far beyond the Donbass region.

What's your assessment of the situation now?

LT. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: So, Victor, let's take a look at those explosions because what we see here are quite a few different areas.

And when you see the geographic diversity of all of these areas, where there's been an explosion, either from a missile or from a bomb or from a rocket or artillery shell that was sent by the Russians, it's basically covering the entire country.

And that is really quite significant because the Russians always believe that artillery was kind of their god of war. This is the pure demonstration of that very fact.

And you see just by the sheer number of explosions that they intended to do this by blanketing the whole country.

CAMEROTA: Colonel, what are you seeing in the airspace above Ukraine?

LEIGHTON: So, Alisyn, that's also something very interesting.

So let's first go to the restricted airspace area.

[14:59:49]

These are the airports, the main airports in Ukraine. And they handle a lot of traffic, particularly in Kyiv and in Lviv and also Odessa. Those are basically the three main areas. Also followed by Kharkiv.

But what happened here, when the Russians came in, they decided that they needed to blanket the airspace and block it off to all traffic.

Voices: Putin has got the west wrapped around his paranoid little finger

If Russian lawlessness had been tackled back in 2006 when Alexander Litvinenko’s widow beseeched world leaders to do something about it, perhaps Ukraine wouldn’t be suffering now

Estonia warned us. So did Latvia and Lithuania. The Baltic States have a long experience of Vladimir Putin’s aggression. They told Europe, the UK and the US, but no one paid much attention. Well, as the cruise missiles, bombs and rockets rain down on Ukraine, everyone’s paying attention now.

The Russia [https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/russia]/Ukraine debacle has been likened to the Cuban missile crisis or even the build-up to the Second World War. But as the west scrambles to sanction Russia and defend Ukraine, those who predicted this disaster are saying: “I told you so.”

In fact, we didn’t need to be told by the Baltic states, who spoke from bitter personal experience. Evidence of Russian malignity was there in front of our noses. It was there in 2006 when Alexander Litvinenko [https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/alexander-litvinenko] had a sushi lunch on Piccadilly, was taken ill and – his face ghastly yellow against the hospital pillows – gradually deteriorated, dying three weeks later from polonium poisoning. His widow said “nothing was done” after a public inquiry into Litvinenko’s death.

A full 12 years then passed before a nerve agent attack on the streets of Salisbury [https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/salisbury]. You’d have thought lessons would have been learned, but the immediate response was confused, and the EU was divided.

It was a similar picture in 2020 when parliament’s intelligence and security committee accused the British government of failing to carry out an adequate assessment of Kremlin attempts to interfere with the 2016 Brexit referendum.

Why has the UK missed so many opportunities to take action? As Lithuania’s prime minister Ingrida Šimonytė told The Guardian earlier this month, we have allowed Putin’s cronies to become embedded in British society. “We have overlooked how these people are using our way of living. They like our universities, our hospitals, banks, because they know rules exist in this part of the world and no one will come and strip them of your possessions. You can go to court to protect yourself, yet at the same time they are trying to undermine our way of living in any way they can,” she said. No wonder they call our capital city “Londongrad”.

Opposition MPs scoffed yesterday when Boris Johnson told them: “We do not raise money from Russian oligarchs.” And while it’s true the law dictates that foreign nationals can’t donate to a UK political party, many extremely wealthy people with dual UK-Russian nationality, or with significant business links with Russia, have bankrolled the Conservatives to the tune of nearly £2m since Johnson became prime minister, according to figures compiled by the Labour Party.

There is, as Šimonytė eloquently explained, a “dangerous schism”: we rail against Moscow and its contempt of our laws, yet still the streets of our capital city are paved with Russian roubles.

Britain told the United Nations Security Council in 2018 that the Salisbury poisoning “was an unlawful use of force – a violation of article two of the United Nations charter, the basis of the international legal order.” Sanctions followed, but Putin remained entirely unscathed.

The same approach is being taken now. Even as Putin prepared to send his fighter jets over the border to Ukraine, Johnson spoke loudly but carried a relatively small stick – to turn President Roosevelt’s famous dictum about foreign policy on its head.

So as the west returns Putin’s artillery fire with an opening salvo of sanctions, the man in charge of the second most powerful military power in the world doesn’t seem to care. If Russian lawlessness had been tackled back in 2006 when Litvinenko’s widow beseeched world leaders to do something about it, perhaps Ukraine wouldn’t be suffering now. But the west’s apparent inability to think beyond political short-term expediency has now created a crisis which will be with us for years to come.

And if our leaders appear incapable of thinking sufficiently far ahead to outwit a master tactician, Putin’s obsession with history also exposes our embarrassing ignorance of the lessons of the past.

No wonder Commonwealth soldiers laughed nervously yesterday when the defence secretary, Ben Wallace namechecked the Crimean War as evidence that the UK had “kicked the backside” of Russia before and “can always do it again”. Had he forgotten the Charge of the Light Brigade, when hundreds of British cavalry were accidentally ordered to ride to their deaths at the hands of Russia’s artillery?

We have short memories. Putin, on the other hand, forgets nothing, and rewrites history accordingly. Back in 2016, the Lithuanian foreign minister, Linas LinkeviÄius, summed up the situation: "Russia is not a superpower, it’s a super problem." If only we’d listened – and acted – then.

The latest on the Russia-Ukraine crisis[https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-attack-a05e7c4563ac94b963134bba83187d46] :

TOKYO — The Ukrainian ambassador to Japan is urging China to join international efforts to stop the Russian “massacre” in his country amid Beijing’s lack of criticism of Moscow’s actions.

“We would very much welcome that China exercises its connection with Russia and talks to Putin and explains to him that it is inappropriate in the 21st century to do this massacre in Europe,” Ukrainian diplomat Sergiy Korsunsky told a news conference in Tokyo.

China has not criticized Russia over its actions against Ukraine, and has joined in verbal attacks on Washington and its allies.

“I do believe China can play a much more active role to work with Putin in a manner we expect for civilized countries to do,” he said.

Korsunsky also asked support from the United States and its allies to provide anti-missile defense equipment to fight Russian cruise missile attacks. He said Ukraine wants to join NATO and called for its support in resolving the conflict.

KYIV, Ukraine — Explosions are being heard before dawn in Kyiv as Western leaders scheduled an emergency meeting and Ukraine’s president pleads for international help.

The nature of the explosions was not immediately clear, but the blasts came amid signs that the capital and largest Ukrainian city was increasingly threatened following a day of fighting that left more than 100 Ukrainians dead.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the government had information that “subversive groups” were encroaching on the city, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Kyiv “could well be under siege” in what U.S. officials believe is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismantle the government and replace it with his own regime.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers on a phone call that Russian mechanized forces that entered from Belarus were about 20 miles from Kyiv, according to a person familiar with the call

___

BEIJING — China’s Embassy in Ukraine says it is arranging evacuation flights for Chinese citizens. An embassy statement Friday says conditions in Ukraine have “deteriorated sharply” but makes no mention of the Russian invasion.

The embassy gave no details on where the evacuation flights would be leaving from. Nor did it say when the charter flights might happen, saying that scheduling will depend on the “flight safety situation.”

It says travelers should be packed and ready to react quickly once flight schedules are announced. Passengers must have a passport from China, Hong Kong or Macau or a “Taiwan compatriot card.”

The embassy earlier advised Chinese in Ukraine to stay home and to put a Chinese flag on their vehicles if they planned to travel long distances.

___

MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines top diplomat says he will travel to Ukraine’s border with Poland to ensure the safety of Filipinos fleeing from the eastern European country now under attack by Russian forces.

Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. did not specify in his tweet Friday where he is going. Nor did he say how many of the approximately 380 Filipinos in Ukraine are trying to flee amid the Russian invasion.

Locsin expressed gratitude to Poland for agreeing to accept fleeing Filipinos without entry visas.

The Philippines has not condemned Russia’s assault on Ukraine but has called for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Its outgoing president, Rodrigo Duterte, has been a vocal Asian critic of U.S. security policies and has nurtured close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jingping.

TOKYO — Asian stock prices are higher early Friday after U.S. shares recovered toward the end of a wild trading day Thursday as the world slapped sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

Benchmarks are up in Japan, South Korea, Australia, Hong Kong and Shanghai.

Japan announced additional sanctions on Russia, including freezing the assets of Russian groups, banks and individuals and suspending exports of semiconductors.

Prices for oil and other commodities have risen sharply, raising inflation fears.

Despite uncertainty about the Ukraine crisis, as well as worries about COVID-19, the turnaround on Wall Street seemed to buoy Asian trading.

___

BRUSSELS — European Union leaders are putting on a united front after a six-hour meeting during which they agreed on a second package of economic and financial sanctions on Russia.

The EU Council president accuses Russia of using “fake pretexts and bad excuses” for justifying its invasion of Ukraine and says sanctions will hurt the government,

The legal texts for the sanctions agreed on are expected to be finalized overnight and be submitted for approval to EU foreign affairs ministers Friday.

EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen says the package includes targeting 70% of the Russian banking market and key state-owned companies.

She says Russia’s energy sector also will be targeted “by making it impossible for Russia to upgrade its refineries.” And there will be a ban on sales of software, semiconductors and airliners to Russia.

___

ADELAIDE, Australia — Australia’s prime minister is accusing China of throwing Russia a lifeline by easing trade restrictions at a time the much of the world is trying to stop the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison was reacting Friday to a report in The South China Morning Post that China had announced it was fully open to Russian wheat imports.

Morrison noted that Australia, the United States, Britain, the European Union and Japan are imposing sanctions on Russia, and said China 's easing of trade restrictions "is simply unacceptable.”

In his words: “You don’t go and throw a lifeline to Russia in the middle of a period when they’re invading another country.”

___

TOKYO — Japan has announced additional sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Friday that the new measures include freezing the assets of Russian groups, banks and individuals and suspending exports of semiconductors and other sensitive goods to military-linked organizations in Russia.

Kishida says that “Japan must clearly show its position that we will never tolerate any attempt to change the status quo by force.”

Earlier in the week, Japan suspended new issuances and distribution of Russian government bonds in Japan, aiming of reduce funding for Russia’s military. It also banned trade with the two Ukrainian separatist regions.

Japan has long sought to regain control of northern islands Russia seized at the end of World War II and previously had tended to be milder toward Moscow.

UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council will vote Friday on a resolution that would condemn Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine “in the strongest terms.” It also would demand an immediate halt to Russia’s invasion and the withdrawal of all Russian troops.

A senior U.S. official says the Biden administration knows the measure will be vetoed by Russia, but believes it is very important to put the resolution to a vote to underscore Russia’s international isolation.

The official says the council vote will be followed by a resolution voted on quickly in the 193-member U.N. General Assembly where there are no vetoes.

The final draft resolution, obtained Thursday by The Associated Press, would reaffirm the council’s commitment “to the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.”

The council is scheduled to vote at 3 p.m. EST Friday.

WASHINGTON — The White House is expressing outrage at “credible reports” from Ukrainian officials that the staff at the shuttered Chernoybl nuclear plant have been taken hostage by Russian troops.

Press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that “we condemn it and we request their release.”

Psaki says the U.S. has no assessment on the state of the plant where radioactivity is still leaking decades after the worst nuclear disaster in history. But she says hostage taking could hamper efforts to maintain the nuclear facility and is “incredibly alarming and greatly concerning.”

Psaki spoke after Alyona Shevtsova, an adviser to the commander of Ukraine’s Ground Forces, wrote on Facebook that the staff at the Chernobyl plant had been “taken hostage” when Russian troops seized the facility.

BRUSSELS — An official at France’s presidential office says the aim of French President Emmanuel Macron’s phone call to Russian leader Vladimir Putin was to demand the immediate halt of military operations.

According to the official at the Elysee Palace, Macron called Putin from Brussels on Thursday just before the start of an urgent meeting of European Union leaders focusing on sanctions against Russia.

The official says Macron made the call after consulting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The official says Macron reminded Putin “that Russia was facing massive sanctions.” The official spoke anonymously in accordance with the French presidency practice.

According to the Kremlin’s report on the call, Putin and Macron agreed to continue their contacts.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says 137 civilians and military personnel have been killed so far in the Russian invasion of his country.

He calls them “heroes” in a video address released early Friday in which he also says hundreds more have been wounded.

Zelenskyy says that despite Russia’s claim it is attacking only military targets, civilian sites also have been struck. In his words: “They’re killing people and turning peaceful cities into military targets. It’s foul and will never be forgiven.”

The president says all border guards on Zmiinyi island in the Odesa region were killed Thursday. Ukraine’s border guard service earlier in the day reported that the island was taken by the Russians.

___

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s president is ordering a full military mobilization to challenge the Russian invasion.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued a decree Thursday evening saying the mobilization would last 90 days.

He ordered the military’s General Staff to determine the number of those liable for service and reservists as well as the order of the call-up.

Zelensky gave his Cabinet the job of allocating funds to pay for the mobilization.

___

BRUSSELS — European Union leaders pledged Thursday to impose tough economic and financial sanctions on Russia, but there is a lack of consensus within the West over cutting the country off the SWIFT financial payment system.

The Belgium-based cooperative is used by more than 11,000 institutions globally. It shuffles money from bank to bank, and removing Russia from it would likely also have an impact on European economies.

Ukraine has requested the move. While the head of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, said EU sanctions need to include the exclusion of Russia from the scheme, many EU leaders remain unconvinced.

Dutch Prime minister Mark Rutte, for instance, said such a decision would also hurt European economies. Rutte said it should be a last-resort measure that could be decided at a later stage.

“A number of countries are hesitant since it has serious consequences for themselves,” he said.

___

BUDAPEST, Hungary - Several thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the Russian embassy in Hungary’s capital on Thursday to denounce Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and demand that Hungary’s government cut its close ties with Moscow.

Waving the flags of Ukraine and the European Union, protesters chanted for peace and an end to the Russian attacks, and demanded that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban pull his country out of its business dealings with Russia.

The demonstration in Budapest was organized by a coalition of six opposition parties that have united to unseat Orban and his ruling Fidesz party in parliamentary elections April 3.

That coalition’s candidate for prime minister, independent conservative Peter Marki-Zay, criticized Orban for his close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and urged the prime minister to “take a clear stand on Hungary’s commitment to the European Union and NATO, our allies.”

___

BRUSSELS — Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat, said he spent his day “reaching out all over the world” to organize a united front against Russia.

Borrell carried his two phones upon arrival at the urgent meeting of EU leaders held on Thursday evening in Brussels.

He said he called more than 20 countries.

“The African Union, (countries in) Latin America, in Southeast Asia, India, Japan, .... a lot,” he said.

Borrell added that the sanctions he prepared with the EU’s executive arm that were agreed by leaders in retaliation to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will start having effect once adopted by the EU Council during a meeting of foreign affairs ministers scheduled Friday.

The EU said sanctions will cover “the financial sector, the energy and transport sectors, dual-use goods as well as export control and export financing, visa policy, additional listings of Russian individuals and new listing criteria.”

___

PARIS — French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Thursday that sanctions that the European allies are discussing to impose on Russia are “massive and aimed at asphyxiating Russia’s economy”.

Measures that will be taken against Russia are “very massive, very strong and I believe they will be very effective,” Le Drian said in an interview with the French broadcaster TF1.

France is working with allies in NATO and at the United Nations on getting an international consensus to isolate Russia following President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine.

___

WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department has at least temporarily withdrawn its remaining diplomatic presence from Ukraine.

The department says a core group of essential personnel who had relocated from the capital of Kyiv to the western city of Lviv near the Polish border earlier this month will now work from offices in Poland rather than on Ukrainian territory.

Earlier this week, the department had instructed those diplomats to work in Lviv during daylight hours but to spend their nights in Poland.

The department says they were ordered late Wednesday not to make the commute back to Lviv to work beginning Thursday until further notice.

___

VIENNA — The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency says it has been informed by Ukraine that “unidentified armed forces” have taken control of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant, adding that there had been “no casualties or destruction at the industrial site.”

IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi called for “maximum restraint” to avoid actions that could put Ukraine’s nuclear facilities at risk.

“In line with its mandate, the IAEA is closely monitoring developments in Ukraine with a special focus on the safety and security of its nuclear power plants and other nuclear-related facilities,” he said in a statement.

___

WASHINGTON — U.S. aviation regulators widened the area of eastern Europe and Russia where U.S. airlines and pilots are barred because of the conflict.

In a new directive Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration prohibited U.S. airlines from flying over any part of Ukraine or Belarus and the western part of Russia.

Earlier restrictions had barred U.S. airlines from flying over the eastern part of Ukraine. The restrictions cover both passenger and cargo flights, but not military ones.

___

MOSCOW — A Russian military plane crashed in the country’s Voronezh region that borders with Ukraine, the Russian military said Thursday night.

The An-26 plane was carrying out a planned flight transporting military equipment and crashed because of technical failure, military officials said, adding that the plane’s entire crew died in the crash.

They didn’t specify how many crew members were on board of the plane.

___

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden says the sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine will not disrupt the global oil and natural gas markets.

Biden says, “Our sanctions package is specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue.”

The president announced a series of sanctions at a White House speech Thursday. The sanctions include restrictions on exports to Russia and sanctions on Russian banks and state-controlled companies.

Biden also says that U.S. oil and gas companies should not exploit the geopolitical risks to hike their prices and raise their profits.

A key concern has been preserving Russian oil and natural gas exports, which are vital sources for Europe and other countries. Financial markets already view the Russian invasion in Ukraine as straining energy supplies with the soon to expire futures contract for Brent crude increasing more than 5% to top $100 a barrel.

___

UNITED NATIONS -- Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Nations has asked the president of the 193-member General Assembly to prepare for an emergency session in the coming days in light of Russia’s military aggression.

Ukraine’s U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya tweeted Thursday that the meeting should be held under the so-called “Uniting for Peace” resolution. The resolution gives the General Assembly the power to call emergency meetings to consider matters of international peace and security when the Security Council is unable to act because of the lack of unanimity among its five veto-wielding permanent members -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France.

The U.N. Security Council is expected to vote Friday on a resolution condemning Russia in the strongest terms possible for attacking Ukraine and demanding the immediate withdrawal of all its forces — knowing that Russia will veto the legally binding measure, according to a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.

___

ROME — Addressing fellow G-7 leaders, Italian Premier Mario Draghi warned that the crisis over Ukraine “could last for a long time, we must be prepared.”

He thanked U.S. President Joe Biden for sharing intelligence in recent weeks. He also had praise Thursday evening for the European Commission for putting what he called “a good proposal of sanctions on the table.”

Italy is “completely aligned with France, Germany and the European Union” on sanctions, he said.

“We must be united, firm, decisive and we must re-affirm in every possible moment our full support to Ukraine,’’ Draghi said in his G-7 remarks, according to the premier’s office.

___

JERUSALEM — Israeli police say they arrested four people suspected of scrawling anti-Putin graffiti on the gate of the Russian embassy in Tel Aviv during a protest.

Several hundred people staged a demonstration outside the Russian Embassy in Tel Aviv on Thursday over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Another smaller protest was held outside the Russian consulate in the northern port city of Haifa.

Israel is home to a large population of immigrants former Soviet Union and their descendants who arrived in the 1990s and 2000s.

Israel maintains good relations with both Ukraine and Russia and has tried to avoid involvement in the conflict. Earlier on Thursday Israel’s foreign minister condemned Russia’s invasion.

___

UNITED NATIONS — Repeating a plea for Russia to halt its invasion of Ukraine, the U.N. chief said Thursday the world body was freeing up $20 million for urgent humanitarian needs in the country.

“Stop the military operation. Bring the troops back to Russia,” Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at U.N. headquarters. He called the offensive wrong and unacceptable, but not irreversible.

“It’s not too late to save this generation from the scourge of war,” Guterres said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the assault is meant to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists have been fighting the government for nearly eight years. The U.S., however, said ahead of time that Russia would try to justify an invasion by falsely claiming that the rebel-held areas were under attack.

The U.N. said Thursday it was relocating some of its roughly 1,500 staffers in Ukraine. However, Guterres reiterated that the U.N. will continue providing aid to people in the country, “regardless of who or where they are.”

___

BRUSSELS — Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said European Union leaders need to adopt sanctions that will be strong enough to impact the Russian economy and the country’s military industrial complex.

“We don’t need sanctions that bark, we need sanctions that bite,” De Croo said upon his arrival at an urgent meeting of EU leaders in Brussels to discuss a new package of measures targeting Russia.

De Croo said the main goal of the sanctions should be to make it hard for Russian financial institutions to access international markets.

Asked whether Russia should be expelled from the Swift payment system financial system that moves money from bank to bank around the world, De Croo said he is open for discussions on that topic.

___

OTTAWA, Ontario — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he spoke with President Zelenskyy and says Canada is imposing more severe sanctions.

The sanctions will target 58 people and entities connected to Russia, including members of that country’s elite and their families, the paramilitary organization known as the Wagner Group and major Russian banks.

The measures, announced Thursday after Trudeau attended a virtual G-7 meeting, will also affect members of the Russian Security Council, including key cabinet ministers.

Canada is also cancelling existing export permits for Russia and will not issue new ones.

Trudeau also says the federal government will be prioritizing immigration applications for Ukrainians who want to come to Canada and is launching a dedicated telephone line for anyone who has any urgent questions about immigrating from Ukraine.

___

KYIV, Ukraine — An adviser to Ukrainian president says that Ukraine has lost control over the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant after a fierce battle.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the condition of the plant’s facilities, a confinement shelter and storage of nuclear waste is unknown.

A nuclear reactor in then-Soviet Ukraine exploded in April 1986, spewing radioactive waste across Europe in the world’s worst nuclear disaster. The exploded reactor has been covered by a protective shelter to prevent radiation leak and the entire plant has been decommissioned.

Podolyak said that after “absolutely senseless attack of the Russians in this direction, it is impossible to say that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe.”

He charged that Russia may mount provocations there and described the situation as “one of the most serious threats to Europe today.”

___

NEW DELHI, India — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi phoned Russian President Vladimir Putin late Thursday night and appealed for an “immediate cessation of violence,” his office said in a statement.

Modi called for efforts to return to diplomatic discussions, saying the “differences between Russia and the NATO group can only be resolved through honest and sincere dialogue.”

Modi also expressed concern over Indian citizens in Ukraine - officials earlier in the day said some 4,000 out of the 20,000 Indian nationals had been evacuated with efforts on to bring the rest back home.

The conversation between the two leaders comes hours after the Ukraine envoy in New Delhi urged Modi to contact Putin, saying the country “has a special relationship with Russia and New Delhi can play a more active role in controlling the situation.”

___

WARSAW — Some of the first refugees from Ukraine have arrived in European Union member Poland by road and rail.

A scheduled train from Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine arrived Thursday afternoon in the Polish town of Przemysl, near Ukraine’s western border, carrying a few hundred passengers.

The passengers of various ages, arriving with bags and backpacks, told The Associated Press they were fleeing war. Some live in Poland and were returning urgently from visits to their homeland.

The chief of Poland’s border guards, Gen. Tomasz Praga, said there was a visible increase in the number of people wanting to cross into Poland.

Officials said Poland has prepared at least eight centers with food, medical care and places to rest.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that “innocent people are being killed” in Ukraine and appealed to the Poles to extend every possible assistance to the Ukrainians who have found themselves in need of help.

___

NAIROBI, Kenya — The African Union chair is urging an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine “to preserve the world from the consequences of planetary conflict.”

The statement by Senegal President Macky Sall and AU Commission chair Moussa Faki Mahamat also calls on Russia to respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity and international law, expressing “extreme concern at the very serious and dangerous situation.”

Few among Africa’s 54 countries have publicly reacted to the invasion.

___

PRISTINA, Kosovo - Kosovo leaders on Thursday rejected Russian President Vladimir Putin’s claim of similarities with Ukraine’s eastern rebel provinces.

Kosovo’s president, prime minister and other senior ministers issued a joint statement denouncing Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

“The massive and unprovoked attack against Ukraine’s cities and villages is one of the most dangerous hits made to the architecture of the international security built after World War II,” said the statement.

Kosovo declared independence in 2008 after a bloody conflict with Serbia years earlier left more than 10,000 people dead and triggered a NATO intervention. Pristina’s government is recognized by the United States and most EU nations, but Belgrade has refused to recognize its independence and relies on support from Russia and China in its bid to retain claims on the territory.

“Dictator Putin’s effort to refer to the Kosovo case and draw parallel are totally unstable, abusive and an attempt to camouflage the lack of any base or reason for the barbarous attack of its forces against a sovereign state,” said the statement.

___

LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would aim to cut Russia off from the U.K.’s financial markets as he announced a new set of sanctions in response to President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

The sanctions include freezing the assets of all major Russian banks, including VTB Bank, the nation’s second-biggest bank, Johnson said Thursday. Britain also plans to bar Russian companies and the Russian government from raising money on U.K. markets.

Britain will also ban the export of a wide range of high-tech products, including semiconductors, to Russia and bar the nation’s flagship airline, Aeroflot, from landing at U.K. airports.

The slate of sanctions comes days after Johnson was criticized for acting too cautiously in response to Russian aggression earlier this week.

Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.K., Vadym Prystaiko, earlier called on world leaders to ban trade in Russian oil and gas and block foreign investment in the country.

___

MOSCOW — The Russian Defense Ministry has formally confirmed that its forces have moved into Ukraine from Crimea.

Until Thursday's statement Russia had said only that it unleashed a barrage of air and missile strikes on Ukrainian air bases, air defense batteries and other military facilities.

The ministry said it has destroyed a total of 83 Ukrainian military facilities. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov confirmed that Russian ground troops advanced toward the city of Kherson northwest of the Crimea peninsula.

Kherson sits on water reservoir used in the past to provide the bulk of fresh water for Crimea until Ukraine cut it with a dam in 2017 in response to Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Konashenkov said Thursday's move allows the resumption of the water supply to Crimea.

___

BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has made a televised address to the nation condemning the Russian attack on Ukraine sharply and vowed that Russian President Vladimir Putin “will not win.”

Scholz said Thursday evening that “we will not accept this violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty by Russia” and vowed to imply severe sanction together with Germany’s allies.

Regarding the military attack on Ukraine, Scholz stressed that Putin “is on his own. It was not the Russian people who decided to go to war. He alone bears full responsibility for it. This war is Putin’s war.”

The chancellor said that “Putin should not underestimate NATO’s determination to defend all its members. That applies explicitly to our NATO partners in the Baltic States, in Poland and in Romania, in Bulgaria and in Slovakia. Without ifs and buts. Germany and its allies know how to protect themselves.”

___

UNITED NATIONS -- A senior U.S. official says the U.N. Security Council is expected to vote Friday on a resolution condemning Russia in the strongest terms possible for attacking Ukraine and demanding the immediate withdrawal of all its forces — knowing that Russia will veto the legally binding measure.

The United States believes it is very important to put the resolution to a vote to underscore Russia’s international isolation, and emphasizes that the veto will be followed quickly by a resolution in the 193-member U.N. General Assembly where there are no vetoes, the official said Thursday. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.

“This is a first step in how the U.N. responds to this premeditated war of choice that Russia has chosen to take, and we will see action in the General Assembly in the coming days,” he said, adding that it is part of a much broader, coordinated response that includes steps the Biden administration and its allies are taking.

The resolution is drafted under Article 7 of the U.N. Charter, which can be enforced militarily, according to the official.

MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin says he was “forced” to order a military action in Ukraine because of the Western refusal to heed Russian security demands.

Speaking at a Kremlin meeting with businesspeople Thursday, Putin said the military action was a “forced measure” that stemmed from rising security risks for Russia.

He said that he was surprised by the West’s “intransigence” regarding Moscow’s security demands. “I was surprised that didn’t move a millimeter on any issue,” he said. “They have left us no chance to act differently.”

Turning to Western sanctions, he said “Russia remains part of the global economy and isn’t going to hurt the system that it is part of as long as it remains there.”

“Our partners should realize that and not set a goal to push us out of the system,” he said in an apparent warning to the West.

___

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensnkyy has urged Moscow to end hostilities, adding that Russian airborne troops have been checked outside Kyiv.

“It wasn’t Ukraine that chose the path of war, but Ukraine is offering to go back to the path of peace,” he said Thursday.

He said a Russian airborne force in Hostomel airport outside Kyiv, which has a big runway, has been stopped and is being destroyed.

The Ukrainian leader said many Russian warplanes and armored vehicles were destroyed but didn’t give numbers. He also said an unspecified number of Russian troops was captured.

He said a difficult situation is developing in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city just over 20 kilometers from the Russian border. In the north the Russians are slowly advancing toward Chernihiv, Zelenskyy said.

He appealed to global leaders, saying that “if you don’t help us now, if you fail to offer strong assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door.”

___

BERLIN — Group of Seven leaders have strongly condemned Russia's attack on Ukraine.

The German government, which currently heads the G7, put out a joint statement after a virtual leaders’ meeting Thursday, vowing to bring “forward severe and coordinated economic and financial sanctions.”

It called “on all partners and members of the international community to condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms, to stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine, and raise their voice against this blatant violation of the fundamental principles of international peace and security.”

___

HELSINKI — Baltic NATO members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have received the first batches of U.S. military troops and equipment promised this week by U.S. President Joe Biden in the wake of the Ukraine crisis.

An undisclosed number of U.S. F-35 fighters landed Thursday afternoon at NATO’s air base in Amari, near Estonia’s capital Tallinn, Estonian media reported. F-35 fighters were reported to have arrived also at NATO’s air base in Lithuania.

On Wednesday evening, the first 40 American soldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade arrived in Latvia, Latvian media reported.

___

A senior U.S. defense official says Thursday's attack by Russia appears to be the first phase in what will likely be a multiple phased, large-scale invasion.

The official said it began around 9:30 p.m. U.S. eastern time, with land- and sea-based missile launches. The official said that roughly more than 100 missiles, primarily short-range ballistic missiles, but also medium-range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, surface-to-air missiles and sea-launched missiles, were launched in the first few hours of the attack.

The official said the Russians are moving on three axes: From Crimea to Kherson, from Belarus toward Kyiv, and from the northeast to Kharkiv.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it’s not clear how many Russian troops are in Ukraine now, and the main targets of the air assault have been barracks, ammunition warehouses, and 10 airfields. The official said Russian ground forces began to move in to Ukraine from Belarus around 5 a.m. Eastern time.

LONDON — Hundreds of protesters have gathered in London to urge Britain and other democracies to step up action against Russia.

Ukrainians living in the U.K. and activists gathered outside Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Downing Street office Thursday, singing the Ukrainian national anthem.

Natalia Ravlyuk, who helped organize the protest, said they wanted the “toughest sanctions and total isolation of Russia now.”

“We ... feel betrayed by democratic states because we have been talking about this war for eight years,” she said. “They just need to wake up and stop Putin now.”

Earlier dozens of protesters also gathered outside the Russian embassy in London.

___

UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations migration agency says it's ready to respond to emerging humanitarian needs in Ukraine.

Antonio Vitorino, director general of the Geneva-based International Organization for Migration, said: “IOM ... is committed to staying and delivering vital assistance to the people of Ukraine.”

“Eight years of conflict in Ukraine have displaced over 1.4 million people who now rely on assistance to meet their daily needs,” he said in a statement. “This escalation will only deepen the humanitarian needs and compound the suffering of millions of families.”

New sanctions and information for LHV customers

25.02.2022

LHV is not directly or through customers significantly influenced by the economies of Russia, Belarus or Ukraine. We are paying close attention to what is happening in Ukraine, but the economic risks or risks to the LHV's services have not increased due to international tensions. We monitor constantly the situation, analyse possible effects and, if necessary, react to changes.

We ask our customers to take into account the following:

* All incoming and outgoing payments are not allowed in any currency to Russian banks Bank Rossiya, Promsvyazbank and VEB.RF. Restrictions also apply to both incoming and outgoing payments in all currencies to Russian banks VTB Bank, Bank Otkritie, Sovcombank and Novikombank and their subsidiaries. US dollar payments to SberBank will not be made.

* Other international payments to and from Russia will be made. However, there may be delays due to sanctions. Please also note that restrictions resulting from sanctions may increase and change over time.

* Due to the events in Ukraine, our foreign brokers have restricted trading in Russian shares. This applies in particular to the purchase of shares in Russian listed companies, but in some cases it may not be possible to sell shares (mainly in the case of GDRs listed on the London Stock Exchange). For those who want to close their existing positions in Russian companies, brokers will try to find suitable solutions.

* Keep in mind that all Estonian natural and legal persons have to comply with the sanctioning regimes of the United Nations, the European Union and the respective countries.

The purpose of financial sanctions is to disrupt the economic well-being of individuals, businesses, economic sectors or even countries by restricting access to assets and other financial instruments.

LHV takes the utmost care and diligence not to allow the movement of funds through the Estonian financial system that may be related to persons included in the sanctions lists. In the event of any suspicion, we will collect additional information from our customers. Therefore, payments related to Russia, Belarus and Ukraine may take longer than usual. To ease the movement of payments, we ask customers to include the exact address of the recipient when making a payment to Russia, Belarus, or Ukraine, and to ask their business partner to include their full address when making payments from those countries. We hope for understanding and will give more information if further developments in Ukraine should have any additional impact on LHV's customer payments.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) says it is "highly likely" Russian forces have captured the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

A statement from the MoD said: "Russian forces have highly likely captured the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Workers have reportedly been detained by Russian troops."

In an intelligence update just after 1am, the MoD also said it is "unlikely" Russia achieved its planned objectives for the first day of its military action in Ukraine.

"The Ukrainian Armed Forces have reportedly halted Russia's advance towards Chernihiv," the MoD statement said.

"Fighting probably continues on the outskirts of the city.

"It is unlikely that Russia has achieved its planned Day 1 military objectives. Ukrainian forces have presented fierce resistance across all axes of Russia's advance."

Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine marks the "beginning of a new era" as she outlined a package of further sanctions on Russia.

Ms von der Leyen said on Twitter: "First, this package includes financial sanctions, targeting 70% of the Russian banking market and key state owned companies, including in defence.

"Second, we target the energy sector, a key economic area which especially benefits the Russian state. Our export ban will hit the oil sector by making it impossible for Russia to upgrade its refineries.

"Third: we ban the sale of aircrafts and equipment to Russian airlines.

"Fourth, we are limiting Russia's access to crucial technology, such as semiconductors or cutting-edge software.

"Finally: visas. Diplomats and related groups and business people will no longer have privileged access to the European Union.

"These events mark the beginning of a new era. Putin is trying to subjugate a friendly European country. He is trying to redraw the map of Europe by force. He must and he will fail."

The Ukrainian foreign minister has said "horrific rocket strikes" have hit Kyiv in an attack he compared to the city's 1941 shelling by Nazi Germany.

"Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany," he tweeted.

"Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one. Stop Putin. Isolate Russia. Severe all ties. Kick Russia out of (everywhere)."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on Twitter the UK has been "true to our word" that Russia's invasion would result in the "toughest sanctions we have ever imposed".

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Russia's assault on Ukraine is "barbaric, unjustified and shows a callous disregard for human life".

She tweeted: "Solidarity with (Ukrainian foreign minister) @DmytroKuleba and the Ukrainian people.

"Putin's assault on Ukraine is barbaric, unjustified and shows a callous disregard for human life. We will continue to hold Putin to account and remain steadfast in our support. £StandwithUkraine".

Mr Kuleba said in a tweet just before 4am on Friday that "horrific rocket strikes" hit Kyiv in an attack he compared to the city's 1941 shelling by Nazi Germany.

The EU ambassador to the UK has said the sanctions imposed on Russia "is a show of strength" from other nations.

Joao Vale de Almeida told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme the package of sanctions are "robust, massive and unprecedented".

He said: "I think equally important is the message that we are sending out. The first one is solidarity with Ukrainian people and Ukrainian leaders, who are suffering right now.

"The second one is condemnation, clear condemnation of the action of Russia and its leader.

"Thirdly, that unity of the West, unity of those that share the same values, not only inside the European Union, but with the United Kingdom, with the US, with Canada, with Japan, Australia and beyond.

"This is a show of strength on our side."

The EU ambassador to the UK has said the sanctions on Russia will have a "huge impact".

Joao Vale de Almeida told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme they will "touch the heart" of the country's economy.

He added: "The measures we are taking today will have a huge impact on Russia, it impacts 70% of the banking system.

"It touched the heart of the state-owned companies that financed the war effort."

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said it is believed Russia intends to invade the whole of Ukraine.

Asked if it is his view the Russians are intent on taking Kyiv and removing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from power, he told Sky News: "It's definitely our view that the Russians intend to invade the whole of Ukraine."

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he would expect Russian President Vladimir Putin to be "held to account" if he committed a war crime.

He told Sky News: "If President Putin commits a war crime, then, just as I do if I were to commit a war crime, I should expect to be held to account."

Asked if Mr Putin's actions already constituted a war crime, he said: "I'm not, I'm afraid, an international lawyer.

"I couldn't tell you the difference between breaking international law insofar as directing your forces to invade another country, versus a war crime - eg. things like genocide, and indeed, you know, torture, etc.

"I wouldn't want to speculate the differences. What I would say is he's clearly broken international law, he's occupying or trying to occupy a sovereign country who made one mistake in his eyes. Their mistake in his eyes was not to choose the Kremlin as a way for their future. And that's all they have done."

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said "it doesn't matter how much effort we made" to prevent an invasion of Ukraine because Vladimir Putin "has been set on this for many, many months and certainly over a year".

He told Sky News: "I wrote an article in January that President Putin was beyond this type of persuasion. President Putin, I said and got criticised at the time, there was a whiff of Munich about President Putin.

"It wasn't the bit about appeasement I was referring to, I was referring that in ... Munich in 1938 Adolf Hitler all along had a plan to invade parts of Europe and all the diplomacy was about a straw man sort of attempt by him to buy time.

"Putin has been set on this for many, many months and certainly over a year, and I think that's why, you know, it doesn't matter how much effort we made - and we all made unbelievable amounts of effort, we saw President Macron go, my Prime Minister regularly spoke to Putin - didn't matter.

"As we're seeing today, it's not about the Donbas, it's not about a minority, it is about a greed to subsume Ukraine into the Russian Federation, or indeed for President Putin to land-grab."

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Russia had "failed to deliver" on its "day one" objectives.

He told Sky News: "Our assessment as of this morning is that Russia has not taken any of its major objectives, in fact it is behind its hoped-for timetable.

"They've lost over 450 personnel. One of the significant airports they were trying to capture with their elite Spetsnaz has failed to be taken. In fact, the Ukrainians have taken it back.

"So, I think contrary to great Russian claims and indeed President Putin's sort of vision that somehow the Ukrainians would be liberated and would be flocking to his cause - he's got that completely wrong. The Russian army has failed to deliver on day one its main objective."

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin's legacy will be "isolation", adding that "diplomacy is absolutely off the table" at this stage.

He told BBC Breakfast: "I think President Putin is slowly but surely building a wall around himself. He will be isolated.

"I think, you know, his legacy is not what he hopes it will be. I think his legacy will be isolation."

He added: "I think at the moment diplomacy is absolutely off the table. We tried. I went to Moscow, Liz Truss went to Moscow, (the) Prime Minister spoke regularly to President Putin and met him on a number of occasions, as did practically every president of, or prime minister of, senior countries in the West.

"So, you know, I'm not sure what more diplomacy would achieve at this very moment in time."

He added: "I think it's important to have a diplomatic link, it's important for us to give messages to the Kremlin direct."

Boris Johnson committed to providing further support to Ukraine after receiving an update from president Volodymyr Zelensky on the "terrible developments" in Kyiv.

A Downing Street statement said: "The Prime Minister spoke to President Zelensky this morning to express his solidarity with Ukraine.

"President Zelensky updated the Prime Minister on the most recent Russian military advances, including missile and artillery strikes on Ukrainian cities and the terrible developments in Kyiv in the early hours of this morning.

"The Prime Minister assured President Zelensky that the world is united in its horror at what Putin his doing. He paid tribute to the bravery and heroism of the Ukrainian people in standing up to Russia's campaign of violence, and expressed his deep condolences for those who have been killed.

"The Prime Minister committed to provide further UK support to Ukraine in the coming days as the people of Ukraine and the world continue to demonstrate that Putin cannot act with impunity."

President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine demands "effective counteraction" from allies against Russia including further sanctions after talking with Boris Johnson.

The Ukrainian leader tweeted: "Held talks with PM @BorisJohnson. Reported on the course of (Ukraine's) defence and insidious attacks on Kyiv by the aggressor. Today (Ukraine) needs the support of partners more than ever.

"We demand effective counteraction to the Russian Federation. Sanctions must be further strengthened."

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said British troops will not be sent to fight "directly" with the Russians.

He told BBC Breakfast: "I said very clearly about a month ago that we are not going to be sending British troops to fight directly with Russian troops.

"We are going to hold the line in Nato. We've always supported Ukraine's application to Nato over the last 15 years, not every country has wanted them to join.

"We've done the next best thing, which is train over 20,000 Ukrainians, provided them with lethal capabilities, which they are using right now.

"But I'm not putting British troops directly to fight Russian troops. That would trigger a European war, because we are a Nato country, and Russia would therefore be attacking Nato."

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he believes "further financial restrictions" against Russia are needed.

Speaking on Good Morning Britain, Sir Keir said he supported the Government's package of sanctions announced on Thursday but called for extra measures.

He said the UK should "break open" shell companies in Britain providing support to Vladimir Putin and target Russia via Swift, an international financial system.

Reacting to news that Russian troops were nearing Kyiv, Sir Keir said the situation was "extremely serious" and Britain should be "absolutely clear" in its stance.

"We have to stand together with our allies, particularly Nato, and it's very important we must stand together as one United Kingdom, and therefore yesterday was significant in Parliament because all political parties spoke with one voice in our support for Ukraine and our support for Nato.

"In relation to the sanctions, I thought what the Government put forward earlier this week was not strong enough. They came forward yesterday with a stronger package and I was able to say that we, the opposition, will support those further sanctions.

"I do want to go further. I think that we do need further financial restrictions, particularly the Swift mechanism. I also think we've got to break open the shell companies we have here in the UK that are providing financial support for Putin."

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said political parties across Parliament will "not be divided" in the response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain, he said Vladimir Putin had "calculated the benefits of aggression outweigh the costs" and said MPs must stand together against him.

"Putin wants to see division among our allies, among our Nato members, and among political parties back here in the United Kingdom, and we are not going to be divided," he said.

But he added that there needs to be a "change" in the way Mr Putin is handled.

"The combined package in response to this, financial measures, sanctions, etc, must not only isolate Russia but must be capable of crippling its ability to function."

"He added: "We are talking about Russia invading a European country here. It's as serious as it gets. We must have an absolutely full response."

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Russian President Vladimir Putin "won't stop" after invading Ukraine.

He said the decision not to "put British service personnel in direct fighting" was not about "risk", but to avoid triggering a "war across Europe".

"It's not about risk, as much as I care for my personnel. It's not about risk," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

"It's about if we were to directly attack Russian aircraft, we would have a war across Europe."

He added: "I have said continually for a long time, as has Britain, and the Prime Minister has supported this position, that Putin is not rational.

"He is trying to invade Ukraine. He won't stop after he's ... with Ukraine. He will use everything in the Baltic states. He doesn't believe the Baltic states are really countries.

"And we will have to stand up to it. Now, I cannot trigger a European war and I won't trigger a European war. But what I will do is help Ukraine fight every street with every piece of equipment we can get to them, and we will support them, and that is the reality."

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said Jeremy Corbyn was wrong about Nato and the party itself has "never wavered" in its support for the alliance.

Asked on Sky News about the former Labour leader's stance on stopping the expansion of Nato, Sir Keir said: "Jeremy Corbyn was wrong about that but the Labour Party's policy never shifted under his leadership and I've been very clear."

Sir Keir added that the "collective failure of the West" in the past response to Vladimir Putin may have emboldened the Russian president but described the party's support for Nato as "unshakeable".

He said: "I do think that the failure, the collective failure, of you know, the West... in relation to action he's taken in the past, so many examples - Georgia, Crimea, Donbas - have given him the sense that as I say the benefits of aggression outweigh the costs.

"We have to be clear that that isn't the case here in relation to Ukraine and that that response package from the rest of the world will be so strong that it will not only isolate Russia but also cripple its ability to function."

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Britain has been asked to provide more support to defend Ukrainian airspace.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "So first of all, anti-air is being supplied to the Ukrainians, and has been.

"A number of the Baltic states, the United States provided Stinger missiles, which has brought down clearly a number of Russian aircraft.

"The ability to defend their airspace from (the) ground has been enabled. And (of) course, there is more to do and... we've been asked and a number of other nations for that.

"But... to do a no-fly zone... I would have to put British fighter jets directly against Russian fighter jets. Nato would have to effectively declare war on Russia because that's what you would do."

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said if Boris Johnson brought forward tougher sanctions on Russia, they would be voted through Parliament "very, very quickly" with the Labour Party's support.

He also strengthened his appeal for Russia to be banned from international financial system Swift, describing the move as a "now decision" which should be made as soon as possible.

"That is a now decision and the Labour Party would support it in full. We think it should happen now," he told BBC Breakfast.

Sir Keir called for shell companies in the UK supporting Vladimir Putin's regime to be targeted, saying there was "frustration" in Parliament that the Government hasn't "got on with this".

"What I've said to the Prime Minister is whatever criticism I've got for you, not having done it now, do it now. If you bring forward legislation, I said to the Prime Minister on Monday, we the Labour Party will vote for it.

"We could bring this through Parliament very, very quickly because those shell companies are hiding assets that are supporting Putin and we have to get our house in order and there's such a will in Parliament at the moment."

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Britain will "work all day" to try to get the Swift international payment system "turned off for Russia".

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Britain wants the Swift system to be turned off for Russia. But unfortunately the Swift system is not in our control - it's not a unilateral decision."

Mr Wallace said the system is used "to move money around", explaining: "When you pay Russia for its gas, it probably goes through the Swift system, for example. It is based in Belgium. It has a number of partners that control it, or nation states."

He added: "We want it switched off. Other countries do not. We only have so many options. We are going to work all day to try and get it (switched off for Russia)."

An urgent question on the military situation in Ukraine will take place in the House of Commons from 11am.

It has been tabled by Conservative MP Peter Bone (Wellingborough).

The House of Lords will be debating Ukraine and Russia from 10am.

The Government has been pressed to give an update on China's position on Ukraine and on missiles "arriving in Serbia ready to destabilise" peace in Bosnia.

As the Commons began a Friday sitting, Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin (Harwich and North Essex) said: "I appreciate there is an urgent question on Ukraine later on, but I wonder if the Government has given any indication about whether they are going to make a statement about our relations with China, given that China has done nothing to condemn the Ukrainian incursion, and whether the Government will also make a statement about what is happening in the Balkans where I understand that missiles are arriving in Serbia ready to destabilise the Dayton Agreement and create a new crisis there."

Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he was sure the Government would take Sir Bernard's comments "very seriously".

Sir Lindsay said: "I have been given no notification that anything is forthcoming. What I would say is that we do have the urgent question and I am sure that he may be able to press the minister if he were able to catch my eye."

Conservative MP Peter Bone (Wellingborough) has tabled an urgent question on the latest information about the invasion of Ukraine, due to be answered at 11am Friday.

Defence minister James Heappey is expected to respond to the urgent question granted in the Commons on Ukraine at 11am.

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries welcomed Uefa's decision to strip St Petersburg of the Champions League final over the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

She said: "I welcome Uefa's decisive action to strip St Petersburg of staging this year's Champions League Final.

"Russia must not be allowed to exploit sporting and cultural events on the world stage to legitimise its unprovoked, premeditated and needless attack against a sovereign democratic state."

Defence minister Baroness Goldie said there is currently no indication Russia intends to "directly target" UK or Nato forces, but they "remain on guard", with cyber attacks expected.

Opening a debate in the House of Lords, Lady Goldie said 1,000 troops are on stand-by to deal with the exodus of people from Ukraine.

She told peers: "It goes without saying that our thoughts and prayers remain with the Ukrainian people, many of whom have family and friends in the UK, and will now find themselves under attack for no reason whatsoever.

"But at the same time we remain on guard. While there is no indication at present that Russia intends to directly target British or Nato forces, we should expect their forces and proxies to launch cyber attacks and misinformation campaigns, seeking opportunities to embarrass the UK or Nato and to undermine our resolve.

"We stand ready to protect our country against any threats, whether conventional or in cyberspace.

"However, I'm afraid there's no disguising the fact that a dark new chapter has opened in our history."

The UK will send further armed forces to Estonia "earlier than planned" to reinforce the Nato ally in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Responding to an Urgent Question, Defence minister James Heappey told the Commons: "In addition to the Royal Tank Regiment battle group that has been in place in Estonia for the last six months, the Royal Welsh battlegroup will be arriving in Estonia earlier than planned to double up our force levels and those doubled-up force levels remain indefinitely.

"They will be augmented by the headquarters of 12 Mechanised Brigade, meaning that the United Kingdom will have an armoured brigade in Estonia reassuring one of our closest Nato allies."

Nato troops must not enter Ukraine because of the "risk of miscalculation" leading to "existential" threat, a minister has said.

Defence minister James Heappey told MPs that the Government would "explore all that we can do to support the Ukrainians themselves over the next few days".

He added: "But we must all in this House be clear that British and Nato troops should not, must not, play an active role in Ukraine.

"We must all be clear what the risk of miscalculation could be and how existential that could very quickly become if people miscalculate and things escalate unnecessarily."

A software engineer and Masters student in Kyiv has said that Ukrainians are "scared, but hopeful and extremely angry" as Russia targets the Ukrainian capital.

Olesia, 22, has been sheltering with friends and family in her home and said she has heard sirens go off four times on February 25.

She told the PA news agency: "We hosted some people, because our house is more reliable, and are hosting family and friends here. We've heard sirens that indicate air alarm, I believe, four times today...

"We have some acquaintances in the part of the city where heavy shelling was coming just now, glad to know they're okay.

"People are scared, but hopeful and extremely angry. We trust our military, we believe we will withstand the attacks, some of my relatives have gone to the territorial defence, I'm considering that too."

She added that she wants the "international public to realise this is a threat to world's safety, not just Ukraine" and for governments across the globe "to ban Russia from Swift and to shelter Ukrainian sky, to provide military and financial help to Ukraine".

Conservative MP Peter Bone asked the minister to update the House on whether the UK and Western allies will institute a no-fly zone on Ukraine.

The MP for Wellingborough said: "We are seeing history repeat itself, as a powerful country, headed by a mad man, is extending its territorial boundaries. First by annexing regions of sovereign countries and then invading those countries. This, of course, is what happened in the 1930s and led to World War."

He added: "The Ukraine ambassador to the United Kingdom has asked for us and our allies to institute a no-fly zone of Ukraine. As the ambassador said, people are dying as we speak.

"This action will be a significant and a real help for the people of Ukraine. Yesterday, when I asked the Prime Minister about this request, he indicated it was not ruled out. Could the minister update the House on this request for help?"

Defence minister James Heappey said a no-fly zone is "somewhat difficult to implement in a hostile airspace against a peer adversary".

He noted eyes must be open to the reality that "in such an event, Nato jets would not possibly, but would most certainly probably, come into a combat situation with Russian jets."

Mr Heappey went on: "The risk of miscalculation and escalation and the triggering of Article 5 could not be understated in those circumstances. In the air domain, the risk of miscalculation is greater because things are happening at Mach 2. And there is no time for political calibration."

Shadow defence secretary John Healey pressed the Government on whether the UK will provide Ukraine with short-range handheld anti-tank missiles.

He said: "On Wednesday, the Prime Minister told the House the UK will be shortly providing a further package of military support to Ukraine. We understand the minister's comments about detail, but has this further military assistance being provided?

"The minister knows he has Labour's full support for this."

Mr Healey said the "UK's short-range handheld anti-tank missiles are working well", adding: "He knows that the Ukrainians need more of these urgently to defend Kiev and their other cities. So, can he confirm that he is willing to go that bit further?"

Mr Healey concluded his remarks by saying: "We've taken peace and security in Europe for granted since the end of the Cold War. We can no longer do that.

"I fear that we will be dealing with the consequences of this Russian invasion now for years to come."

Responding to shadow defence secretary John Healey, Defence minister James Heappey said anti-tank missiles had "already proven to be invaluable" in the conflict in Ukraine.

Mr Heappey said the weapons were "high on our list of things that we are looking to supply", adding: "They are unsubstantiated reports, but nonetheless we are aware of the number of circumstances in which they have been used to defeat Russian armour, and we are therefore very aware of their utility both in open battle during the initial phase of the conflict but also in the urban domain in any resistance or insurgency that might follow."

The Defence minister also shared insight that Russia's invasion had not been as successful as planned.

He said: "Suffice to say, we are pretty certain that in the Kremlin last night there will have been some pretty urgent reflections on the speed of the advance compared to what they anticipated.

"I think that Russian people should be calling President Putin and the kleptocracy that surrounds him out on that, because young Russian men and women are being sacrificed in the name of President Putin's hubris."

A total of 1,000 UK troops are on stand-by to support Ukraine's neighbours with refugee responses, a Defence minister has said.

Labour MP for Pontypridd Alex Davies-Jones asked: "Will the 1,000 UK troops that he has placed on stand-by to help with the humanitarian crisis now be urgently deployed?"

Defence minister James Heappey replied: "Just to be very clear - because I think unless I am almost doing her a dis-service - I might have understood her question to be will the 1,000 troops go into Ukraine as they did into Kabul into the summer to facilitate the egress of Ukrainians.

"I am afraid she will be disappointed. That is just not something that could realistically be done. This is a highly kinetic combat situation and the probability of Nato troops being caught up in combat with Russian armed forces is far too high and would lead to huge escalation.

"The 1,000 troops that are on stand-by are there to support Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Poland with the expected humanitarian challenges that they will face as people make their way out of Ukraine."

Conservative MP Dr Luke Evans (Bosworth) asked: "What sanctions and steps will we take to make sure that Belarus feel the pain for what they are doing?"

Mr Heappey replied: "The Belarusian ambassador has been summoned to the Foreign Office today to have the views of Her Majesty's Government shared with them. Belarus has also been included in the sanctions regime."

Downing Street said "nothing is off the table" in support of Ukraine.

A spokesman for Boris Johnson said: "We remain firmly behind Ukraine and will continue to support them."

The spokesman said he could not go into detail over the support being provided but the UK had "talked about protective equipment, helmets, body armour, as well as some of the defensive lethal aid that we've provided in terms of anti-tank weaponry".

The UK Government is working "incredibly closely" with Ukraine's neighbours to support those fleeing the country, No 10 said.

"You'll be aware that we deployed an extra 350 troops to Poland a fortnight ago to help exactly with that task," a spokesman for Boris Johnson said and he pointed towards the Home Secretary's announcement on visa extensions.

Boris Johnson is expected to raise the prospect of banning Russia from the Swift payment system with allies again on Friday, Downing Street said.

A spokesman for the Prime Minister was asked whether the UK would be pushing for the sanction and he said: "You'll have heard the Prime Minister's comments in the House on this yesterday, we will continue to work with allies to try and cut Russia off from Swift.

"You'll be aware that the PM raised this in his call with G7 leaders yesterday, I expect he will raise it at the Nato leaders meeting again today."

The spokesman would not be drawn on which countries were holding out on the proposal but he said: "We've set out why we want to ensure that we can do this, as the Prime Minister said yesterday to ensure that we send a clear message to Vladimir Putin that his efforts will not succeed and to ensure that we can deal a severe blow to the Russian economy."

"As I say, the Prime Minister will raise it again later today," he added.

Conservative MP Nickie Aiken (Cities of London and Westminster) wondered if President Vladimir Putin may listen to the Russian mothers of the soldiers who are now undertaking his aggression.

She said: "As I said goodbye to my own children this morning and wish them a good day in school, my thoughts turned to the mums in Ukraine who now fear for the future of their own children.

"And, as we saw in the newspaper today, and I was taken by the photos in the Daily Mail of children, primary school children taking shelter in in bomb shelters, if President Putin has failed to listen to the major international diplomatic efforts, if he has failed to listen to Nato, to the EU, and the Ukrainian people, does my right honourable friend think he may listen to the Russian mothers of the soldiers who are now undertaking his aggression?"

Defence minister James Heappey said: "I hope so, but I fear that he's not the sort of man that does and that's why we need to do everything we can to empower those people with all the information we can get them about the complete disregard that President Putin has for the lives of their boys and girls."

Mr Heappey said he was "struck" by reports of the Russian use of mobile crematorium to follow their front lines as whilst colleagues back from Iraq and Afghanistan were buried in flag-draped coffins, "Putin just sends around a mobile crematorium and burns them".

This is a "social media rage war", defence minister James Heappey has said.

Mr Heappey's comments came as Labour former minister Dame Diana Johnson pressed the minister on whether the Government will be recording the use of sexual violence in warfare.

She said: "I wanted to just press the minister a little bit more on war crimes. I'm very pleased to hear that they are being recorded and monitored.

"I wondered, in particular, if the minister could just say something about the use of sexual violence in warfare, and how his Government will be recording that, and then what exactly will happen next, just so I understand what the process will be?"

Mr Heappey replied: "It's no consolation to the people of Ukraine but within the British armed forces we've given a huge amount of thought to how we must operate in future conflict very mindful of women, peace and security, and the challenges that far too many women and children face in conflict broadly pursued between men.

"I'm not sure, I'm afraid, that there is that much regard for that being given by the Russians. But I would come back to it if I have any information to the contrary."

The minister insisted war crimes will be monitored "as best we can", adding: "As she's seeing from all of the open source intelligence that's available on social media, this is a very different type of war to even Gulf War One and Two. This is a social media rage war. And these outrages are often there."

Boris Johnson will host the leaders of the V4 countries in London next month to discuss the Ukraine crisis.

No 10 said the Prime Minister will hold a meeting with the leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia on March 8 to "discuss the situation in Ukraine and the UK's support for security in the region".

More sanctions are needed to hit Russia, including targeting Vladimir Putin's inner circle, Boris Johnson has agreed with the leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF).

The JEF is a UK-led group comprising Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Latvia and the UK which works together to deliver forces at high readiness, across a range of roles.

A No 10 spokesman said the Prime Minister spoke to the leaders on Friday.

The spokesman said: "He reiterated that this was a defining moment in European history, with global implications. The Prime Minister said he believed the Ukrainian people would continue to fight and had done so gallantly in the recent hours and days.

"The leaders agreed that more sanctions were needed, including focusing on President Putin's inner circle, building on the measures that had already been agreed."

Mr Johnson said more support must be given to Ukraine "as a matter of the greatest urgency".

Maxim Yermalovich, the ambassador to the UK from Russia-ally Belarus, has arrived at the Foreign Office after being summoned over the Ukrainian invasion.

Russia has said the Defence Secretary could have used "similar adjectives" to describe Boris Johnson when he told troops that Vladimir Putin had gone "full tonto".

Ben Wallace made the unguarded comments while chatting to serving military personnel earlier this week.

Maria Zakharova, Russia's foreign affairs ministry spokesperson, was asked about the comments by Sky News at a press briefing on Friday.

According to the translation on Sky News she said it was "surprising that such evaluations are given by (the) defence minister of the UK regarding authorities of a different state".

She said that "I think he could have thought up of similar adjectives... thinking of (the) British Prime Minister, if we talk about personal judgment."

The bulk of Russian forces advancing on Kyiv remain "more than 50km from the centre of the city", the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said.

In an intelligence update posted about 3.30pm, the MoD said the Russian armoured forces had "opened a new route of advance towards Kyiv having failed to capture Chernihiv".

The report said there were "reports of sporadic clashes in the northern suburbs of Kyiv, which we continue to monitor" but that "the bulk of Russian forces advancing on Kyiv remain more than 50km from the centre of the city".

Foreign Office minister James Cleverly urged Belarus to "stop supporting Russia's illegal and unprovoked" offensive in Ukraine after summoning Minsk's ambassador.

A Foreign Office statement added: "Belarus needs to desist from its support to Russia and respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty in line with its international obligations."

Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said President Putin's actions in attacking Ukraine were "disgraceful".

Speaking in Newcastle, she said: "It is absolutely heartbreaking to see the footage out of Ukraine, and the responsibility and the death and the bloodshed lies with Putin.

"He shouldn't have done this. He knows that he's broken international law.

"This is devastating to see what's happened here and the hand of history will not be kind to Putin and his regime for what they've done.

"It is really devastating to see what's happening.

"All of my thoughts are with the people of Ukraine and people who are watching that, and people in Russia who have strong links to family in Ukraine who are seeing this.

"It's disgraceful what Putin has done and he will be judged by his actions by the international community."

Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner welcomed the Prime Minister's vow to help Ukrainian refugees.

Speaking in Newcastle, she said: "We should be working with our international allies and partners to support every Ukrainian who needs that support at the moment.

"They are in need, and we should be responding to that need."

She said she was proud to be British and to see the support shown for Ukrainians.

Ms Rayner said: "To see those pictures and to hear that statement for those soldiers that wouldn't give up when they were told to give up, 13 of them, and they all were killed, to see that and to see the defiance against that regime who was trying to use bloodshed to bring people to their knees.

"I'm incredibly proud of the Ukrainians and I'm proud I'm proud of what our country is doing to support their freedom and their right to exist.

Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has said "the world will hold Russia and Belarus accountable for their actions".

Addressing a press briefing following a virtual meeting of Nato leaders, Mr Stoltenberg said: "We call on Russia to stop this senseless war immediately."

He warned that "the Kremlin's objectives are not limited to Ukraine" and that "we are facing a new normal in European security where Russia openly contests the European security order and uses force to pursue its objectives".

He said: "President Putin's decision to pursue his aggression against Ukraine is a terrible strategic mistake."

Mr Stoltenberg added that although significant sanctions had already been announced "we must stand ready to do more, even if it means we have to pay a price, because we are in this for the long haul".

The secretary-general said Nato had deployed thousands more troops to the eastern part of the alliance, and will "do what it takes to protect and defend every ally and every inch of Nato territory".

Britain's chief of defence intelligence has said that Russian forces are seeking to encircle the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, with a view to imposing a pro-Moscow regime.

Lieutenant General Sir Jim Hockenhull said the Ukrainian military was continuing to offer "strong resistance" in the face of the Russian advance.

"Russian forces continue to advance on two axes towards Kyiv.

"Their objective is to encircle the capital to secure control of the population and change the regime," he told reporters.

"Overnight Russian launched a concerted series of strikes on targets Kyiv. Ukrainian armed forces continue to offer strong resistance focusing on the defence of key cities throughout Ukraine."

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng met with BP's chief executive Bernard Looney on Friday to discuss the company's 20% stake in Russia's state-backed oil giant Rosneft.

Mr Looney also sits on the Rosneft board, along with former BP boss Bob Dudley.

Rosneft's chief executive Igor Sechin - a close ally of Vladimir Putin - is on the US sanctions list.

A Whitehall source told the PA news agency: "BP left the meeting with no doubt about the strength of the Business Secretary's concern about their commercial interests in Russia."

Boris Johnson has told Nato leaders that "immediate action" must be taken to ban Russia from the Swift payment platform to "inflict maximum pain" on Vladimir Putin.

The Prime Minister attended a virtual meeting of the leaders on Friday afternoon and warned Nato leaders that Mr Putin was "engaging in a revanchist mission to overturn post-Cold War order", according to a No 10 spokesperson.

The spokesperson said the PM had "urged leaders to take immediate action against Swift to inflict maximum pain on President Putin and his regime"

Mr Johnson told the leaders "the UK would introduce sanctions against President Putin and foreign minister Sergei Lavrov imminently, on top of the sanctions package the UK announced yesterday", bringing the Government in line with measures announced by the EU.

The spokesperson said: "He warned the group that the Russian president's ambitions might not stop there and that this was a Euro-Atlantic crisis with global consequences."

No 10 said Boris Johnson told Nato leaders that the UK armed forces "stood ready for any further request" for further military support.

A Downing Street spokesperson said the Prime Minister told a meeting of Nato leaders on Friday "that the world must make certain President Putin would fail in this act of aggression".

The spokesperson said the PM told the meeting "Ukraine was showing strong resistance, he added that there could no normalisation of relations with Russia after this act".

"The Prime Minister outlined details of the UK's new offer to Nato across its eastern flank. The UK stood ready for any further request from Nato's Supreme Allied Commander Europe to go further with military support to Nato from UK Armed Forces, he said," according to the spokesperson.

"Nato should have primacy in the future of European security and it was vital that it was strengthened now, the Prime Minister added."

Western allies fear Russia could use thermobaric weapons against Ukrainian forces if they continue to hold up their advance.

Western officials believe Russian forces missed most of their day one objectives of the invasion and could resort to indiscriminate firing to make up ground.

One official said this could include thermobaric weapons which Russia is known to have in its armoury and has used in past conflicts - although they have not been seen so far on the battlefield in Ukraine.

"My fear would be that if they don't meet their timescale and objectives they would be indiscriminate in their use of violence," the official said.

Ireland's deputy premier Leo Varadkar has branded Vladimir Putin the "Hitler of the 21st century".

The Tanaiste acknowledged that sanctions such as the potential banning of Russia from the Swift payment network would have economic implications for Ireland.

But he said those consequences needed to be accepted given the situation in Ukraine.

"I don't think we're in that space where we can be concerned about the economic impact on Ireland when a democratic country in the European Union is being invaded and the attempt is being made to overthrow a democratic government there," he told RTE Radio One.

Mr Varadkar added: "The last time I can think of that happening in Europe is in the 1930s and I think we should see this conflict in that context.

"We knew that Putin was a bad man, we've known that for a long time now, but we didn't think that he would be the Hitler of the 21st century and I think he's putting himself into that space."

Russian ambassador to Ireland Yuri Filatov has claimed his country's invasion of Ukraine is a "humanitarian intervention".

Mr Filatov said there was no proof that Russian forces had targeted civilians in the assault.

He claimed Ukraine had used engagement in diplomacy in recent times as a cover for preparing an offensive on the Donbas region of the country.

"It's not our choice, the military option is not our choice," he told RTE.

He added: "There was no other choice to end the suffering of Donbas through real humanitarian intervention - that's what this special operation is exactly about.

"The only aim of the operation is to neutralise the ability of the Ukrainian military to inflict any more suffering on Donbas. Ukrainians should not be afraid of that."

His comments come amid increasing calls from opposition parties in Ireland to expel Mr Filatov from the country.

Asked why he should be allowed to stay, the ambassador said: "You might ask your Government, it's up to them. I can leave any time."

The Transport Secretary said he has extended a UK flight ban on Russian aircraft to include private jets.

The Government previously announced it was banning Russia's flag carrier Aeroflot from landing in the UK.

Grant Shapps tweeted: "Putin's actions are unlawful and anyone benefitting from Russia's aggression in Ukraine is not welcome here. I've strengthened our ban in the UK so that no Russian private jet can fly in UK airspace, or touchdown - effective immediately."

Boris Johnson has addressed a message directly to the people of Russia, saying in Russian: "I do not believe this war is in your name."

In a video posted on social media, the Prime Minister also spoke Ukrainian after urging an end to the conflict "because the world needs a free and sovereign Ukraine".

He said: "The scenes unfolding in the streets and fields of Ukraine are nothing short of a tragedy.

"Brave young soldiers and innocent civilians are being cut down, tanks are rumbling through towns and cities, missiles raining indiscriminately from the skies.

"It's a generation or more since we witnessed such bloodshed in Europe. We hoped we would never have to see such sights again."

Mr Johnson continued: "The people of the United Kingdom stand with our Ukrainian brothers and sisters in the face of this unjustifiable assault on your homeland.

"We salute the fierce bravery and patriotism of your government, your military and your people."

The Prime Minister went on to say: "Like Ukraine, Russia's poets and artists and authors have shaped our culture and Russia's soldiers fought so bravely with us in the struggle against fascism.

"But Putin's actions are leading to complete isolation for Russia, shunned by the rest of the international community, hit by immense economic sanctions and facing a needless and bloody war that is already costing countless lives, from innocent Ukrainians to your Russian soldiers who will never see their families again."

Putin’s war on the West is a bid to redraw Europe

Vladimir Putin has embarked on his biggest gamble, one that will ­redraw the map of Europe, trigger devastating war and partly restore his beloved Soviet empire.

The Russian President has ­orchestrated an unspeakable ­carnage as innocent Ukrainians cower under a brutal onslaught of bombs and tanks in scenes more reminiscent of Hitler’s invasion of Poland than modern Europe.

The rest of the world, including Australia, is watching in jaw-dropping horror at Russia’s invasion, hurling its collective disgust at Putin and threatening to impose evermore sweeping financial and economic sanctions on Moscow.

And yet the West is all but powerless to stop this war. It can only watch on helplessly as Putin drives a stake through the heart of those who naively believed the fall of the Berlin Wall three decades ago marked the end of Russian despots. An unprovoked attack on a major European power was confined to the history books, or so we thought.

What is remarkable about his attack on Ukraine is how Putin, a lifelong risk-taker, has managed to turn the odds in this crisis so heavily in his favour. At least for now.

The US and NATO will not bend in their refusal to intervene militarily to defend Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. Even if there were a will to try to defend Ukraine militarily, a war fought right on Russia’s border would come at a cost in lives that no Western nation would accept.

From his vantage point in the Kremlin, Putin sees nothing but opportunity. He sees a divided Europe which too often seemed more concerned about losing access to Russian gas supplies than it was about the invasion of a sovereign nation. He sees a polarised America, weary of foreign wars with an ageing President who is still damaged by the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Polls this week show just 26 per cent of Americans think the US should play a major role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, giving Joe Biden little room to move.

With China, Putin has worked assiduously in recent months to forge closer links with Beijing and neutralise any opposition on Ukraine.

As Michele Flournoy, the top Pentagon policy official in the Obama administration, says; “We’re seeing that while Beijing doesn’t really like Putin’s tactics, they’re willing to band together as authoritarian states against the Western democracies.”

Satellite imagery released on February 24 shows the movement of Russian military vehicles in south western parts of Belarus, near the Polish and Ukrainian borders.

In the meantime, Putin has slowly and methodically ensured that his invasion, which began in earnest on Thursday, is likely to be a military rout given that he had surrounded Ukraine on three sides with more than 170,000 Russian troops backed by tanks, missiles and overwhelming firepower.

This week, Putin put the final touches on his invasion plans by giving a tortured re-imagining of Ukrainian history to try to argue that Kyiv had no rights as a sovereign nation. Putin’s message to Russians is that an invasion of Ukraine is really not an invasion of another country, but a reclaiming of a lost part of Russia, like a spiritual reunion of long lost friends. It is an argument that sinks under scrutiny but which exploits popular nostalgia for the Soviet empire, the loss of which Putin has called “the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century”.

On every level, Putin has confected this Ukraine invasion like a Russian grand master in chess, carefully moving his pieces into place, politically, militarily and psychologically, over many months to prepare for this terrible moment.

As such he is on the cusp of something he has spent decades longing for.

“Putin’s overarching aim is reversing the consequences of the Soviet collapse, splitting the transatlantic alliance and renegotiating the geographic settlement that ended the Cold War,” says former US intelligence officer Angela Stent. “The current crisis between Russia and Ukraine is a reckoning that has been 30 years in the making. It is much more than Ukraine and its possible NATO membership. It is about the future of the European order crafted after the Soviet Union’s collapse.”

Biden was equally blunt about Putin’s ambitions. Putin “has much larger ambitions than Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is about,” he says.

The question is why now? After all, Putin made similar claims about Ukraine being a natural part of greater Russia when he invaded Ukraine’s Crimea Peninsula in 2014, yet he stopped short of attacking the rest of the country.

At that time, citing Crimea’s long history as part of Russia, Putin said of Crimea: “This strategic territory should be under a strong, sovereign state and that in fact can only be Russia.”

Putin justifies this week’s invasion of Ukraine on the spurious grounds that the country could be a “springboard” for a NATO ­attack against Russia.

NATO has certainly provoked Russia by progressively expanding eastwards since the end of the Cold War. But Ukraine is no closer now to joining NATO than it was in 2014. Putin has made a series of impossible demands on NATO, one of which is to promise that there will be no further expansion of the pact, including Ukraine.

For reasons which only Putin can truly know, this was his ­moment to act.

“The President of the Russian Federation is operating at a higher risk-tolerance level,” says Lieutenant General Ben Hodges who commanded the US Army in ­Europe from 2014 to 2017. “He is confident because we, the West, have not stopped him before or forced him to back down.”

But Putin’s decision to invade still comes with significant risk, even if he knows that Russia cannot be defeated militarily by the far smaller Ukraine army.

The size and scale of the sanctions which the West are now set to impose on Russia will dwarf those previously imposed on ­Moscow for Putin’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 or his invasion of Georgia in 2008.

The US and Europe initially announced relatively modest sanctions this week, reserving the toughest measures for a full scale invasion. Biden claims his planned sanctions will effectively cut Russia off from Western financing and inflict grievous harm on Russia’s economy and its leadership. German chancellor Olaf Scholz, who had previously been noncommittal about tough sanctions, this week agreed to put the $11bn Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline on hold, a move that will deny Moscow increased energy sales to Europe. This is one measure that will directly hurt Russia, but it also hits the EU which receives one third of its energy from Russia.

Russian sanctions will also hurt Europe, the US and the global economy and it will be a test of Western resolve to maintain them and increase them. Putin knows that mega-sanctions will damage Russia’s already stagnant economy, but it is obvious that he has already factored this into his overall plan on Ukraine. Putin has planned for this day and for these sanctions. Ever since the West imposed sanctions on Russia after the 2014 annexation of Crimea, Putin has been working to make Russia’s economy “sanction proof” by boosting foreign reserves, buying gold, and exporting more from neutral countries like China. Russia’s central bank has $US630bn in reserves of foreign exchange and gold, having grown from $US368bn in 2015. It would take a complete collapse of Russia’s economy – an unlikely scenario – for Putin’s leadership to be jeopardised.

The greater risk for Putin in invading Ukraine is not the immediate military outcome, but rather the long-term plan if Russian troops were to become an ­occupying force.

It is expected that Putin’s overwhelmingly superior Russian forces will conquer Ukraine in a relatively short period of time. But then what?

Ukraine is a democratic country of 44 million people, the ­majority of whom like their democracy and their freedoms and who say, according to the polls, that they would like their country to one day become a member of NATO.

In announcing his invasion, Putin claimed that he does not intend to occupy Ukraine, but rather seeks to “demilitarise” the country. But it is unclear how he can exert real control over Ukraine without keeping Russian troops there.

By invading and continuing to occupy Ukraine, Putin risks a military quagmire where Russian troops are drawn into a guerrilla-style war against pro-Ukrainian militia. This is what doomed Russia in Afghanistan in the 1980s.

NED-5569-Key cities in Putin’s sights

And then there is the vast human cost, although Putin gives no sign of caring about this. US intelligence estimates project an all-out invasion of Ukraine would see between 25,000 and 50,000 civilians killed or wounded, and between 5000 and 25,000 Ukrainian troops and 3000 to 10,000 Russian troops killed or wounded. It would be easily the most devastating conflict in ­Europe since World War II.

Putin has been careful to keep his options open and watch how the world reacts. His decision early in the week to formally recognise the independence of the breakaway pro-Russian areas of Donetsk and Luhansk in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine and then start sending Russian forces only into that ­disputed region initially confounded the US and Europe. Was it a true “invasion” and what level of sanctions should be imposed on Moscow?

It was only on Thursday when Putin launched his bombing campaign in Kyiv and other cities that his true intentions became clear.

Putin’s journey to this point in history has been a deeply personal one. When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and the Soviet Union disintegrated, he was a KGB officer based in Dresden in Germany. His life’s work to that point became meaningless overnight. Suddenly millions of Russians found themselves living outside Russia, in newly independent countries like Ukraine. A smaller, weaker Russia saw 41 per cent of its GDP vanish overnight. It was no longer a superpower

Putin claimed in a recent speech that he, like millions of Russians, fell on hard times in the 1990s as he tried to remake his life. He even claimed to have been a taxi driver for a while, saying: “Honestly, it’s not very pleasant to speak about.”

After the fall of the Soviet Union, “people found themselves abroad overnight, taken away, this time indeed from their ­historical motherland”, Putin wrote last year in a 5000-word essay which was delivered to Russian troops.

Putin speaks bitterly about what he calls the broken promises from the West at the time that NATO would never extend eastwards beyond Germany.

Observers say a turning point for the Russian President was the decision by NATO to turn eastwards in 2004 and grant membership to Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.

In 2007, Putin angrily accused the US of going too far and of having “overstepped its borders in every way”. NATO’s expansion, he said, was also “a serious provocation that reduces everybody’s trust”.

Then in 2008, NATO prematurely declared that Georgia and Ukraine “will become members of NATO”. It was one provocation too far for Putin who invaded Georgia later that year.

Putin has also detested what he sees as the belittling of Russia by the West in the post Cold War years. The late US senator John McCain famously disparaged Russia as a “gas station masquerading as a country”, while Barack Obama would refer to Moscow as merely a “regional power”.

Rodric Braithwaite, the British ambassador to Moscow when the Soviet Union collapsed, believes Putin’s wounded pride about the collapse of the Soviet Union is shared by many ordinary Russians.

“What Putin says about the humiliation of the Soviet collapse, the enlargement of NATO, and the intimate historical link between Russian and Ukrainian history is not his own idea,” Braithwaite says.

“Millions of Russians think and feel just like he does.”

But the scale of the attack on Ukraine has also shocked many Russians, with thousands taking to the streets to protest before being subdued by police.

Putin’s speech this week days before the invasion saw him reach new levels of sentimental extremes about Ukraine to publicly justify what was about to ­unfold.

“Ukraine is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space,” Putin said.

“These are our comrades, those dearest to us – not only colleagues, friends and people who once served together, but also relatives, people bound by blood, by family ties.”

He portrayed Russia as the victim. “Ukraine will serve as the springboard for the strike (against Russia),” Putin claimed without evidence. “If our ancestors had heard about it, they probably would simply not have believed it. And today, they don’t want to believe it but it’s true.”

Putin continued on this theme when he announced the Russian offensive on Thursday, saying Russia couldn’t “tolerate the threat that emanates from modern” Ukraine. He asserted that the attack was needed to protect pro-Russian civilians in Donbas – even though his forces also ­attacked infrastructure in Kyiv and across the country.

“We were simply left with no chance to act otherwise,” Putin told a meeting of Russian business leaders this week.

Putin has ordered this military offensive knowing that it will come at great cost to US and ­European prestige. He knows that Biden is ultimately impotent to control what now happens in Ukraine.

The US President has sent more American troops to Europe and will reposition them around the Baltic States. Biden has said he will not send in troops to fight Russia in Ukraine but has vowed to defend any attack on a NATO member should Putin seek to ­expand his strikes beyond Ukraine’s borders. Sanctions and angry rhetoric are all that Washington, Europe and Australia can throw at Moscow for now.

America’s inability to persuade Putin to back down is a historic diplomatic failure and the gut-wrenching images this week bombs exploding across Ukraine will only heighten the sense of helplessness that many in the West feel. It has the potential to gravely hurt Biden’s presidency. A new Gallup poll shows just 36 per cent of Americans approve of how Biden has handled the situation with Russia, while 55 per cent disapprove. Worst of all, especially for Australia, is the fear that Western impotence over Ukraine could embolden China over Indo-Pacific flashpoints like Taiwan and the South China Sea.

But this is all a part of Putin’s plan. By invading Ukraine he has forced Washington to look to ­Europe at a time when it wants to concentrate on the challenge of a rising China in the Indo-Pacific.

As The Wall Street Journal puts it: “Russia’s audacious military assault on Ukraine is the first major clash marking a new order in international politics. This emerging order leaves the US contending with two adversaries at once in geographically disparate parts of the world.”

Ever since he came to power in 1999, Putin has been a risk-taker. He has subjugated democracy in Russia to effectively anoint himself as a dictator and has surprised the West with his boldness in sending Russian troops into Syria, annexing Crimea and invading Georgia.

But Putin’s invasion of Ukraine dwarfs his previous excesses. In the eyes of the West, he will now sit in the pantheon of Russian tyrants alongside Stalin and Lenin.

As Biden put it: “Who in the Lord’s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belonged to his neighbours?”

Biden is right when he says Putin has created this “premeditated war” in Ukraine and that “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this ­attack will bring”.

But in the same breath Biden also claims that “the world will hold Russia accountable”. The burning question is how?

The Ukraine Crisis: Eastern European Neighbors Face a Military Reckoning

RZESZOW, Poland -- European countries on the border with Russia or Ukraine put troops on high alert and are rapidly expanding their militaries, with the Russian invasion of its smaller neighbor set to be a watershed moment for the U.S.'s easternmost allieson the continentand the military alliance that binds them together.

Lithuania introduced a state of emergency and reinforced military deployments near its border with Russia, while Poland kept active military personnel on duty and canceled leaves of absence and rotations home for the foreseeable future.

Both countries also called on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to invoke Article 4, a clause that would require all 30 governments in the military alliance to hold consultations on the crisis in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Slovakia and Hungary sent troops to manage a possible influx of people fleeing Ukraine.

Defense ministers, intelligence officers and senior politicians from Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia -- all NATO members that border either Russia or Ukraine -- say the long buildup to the invasion of Ukraine has driven them to aggressively ratchet up their military capabilities.

"We don't want to take chances," said Latvia's Defense Minister Artur Pabriks. "We never again want to be under the rule of such guys as him and under the Russians and we will do whatever it takes to keep them out of the country."

Latvia and its Baltic neighbors called Thursday for Russia to be disconnected from the Swift global payment system, escalating diplomatic pressure for what U.S. officials have seen as a sanction of last resort.

For years, Central and Eastern European countries counted on NATO's common-defense clause to protect them against aggression from Russia. At the same time, the alliance avoided rotating substantial numbers of troops there to avoid provoking Russia or violating commitments under a 1997 Russia-NATO agreement.

But U.S. reticence to move troops through the region has steadily fallen away. On Thursday, the first group of 40 U.S. troops arrived in Latvia, to be followed by hundreds more across the Baltic states. The U.K. is sending tanks and armored cars to Estonia and doubling its troop deployments there.

At the same time, governments in Poland and Estonia are ramping up their own capabilities, to ensure their defenses are enough to deter a Russian invasion -- or repel one for long enough to allow NATO allies to assist them.

The Polish government is seeking to nearly double the head count of the country's military to 300,000 people, which would make it one of Europe's largest by troop levels.

That increase began last July, when Polish President Andrzej Duda received intelligence reports from the U.S., later confirmed by Poland's own security services, that Russia -- supported by Moscow's close ally, Belarus -- was likely to escalate conflicts with neighboring states in coming months, a senior adviser to Mr. Duda said. Those plans accelerated in the fall, when Belarus encouraged thousands of asylum seekers, mostly from the Middle East, to cross Poland's border.

Now Poland is buying 250 Abrams tanks from the U.S., part of $6 billion of other defense equipment purchased from American defense contractors that includes thousands of antitank missiles and other sophisticated weapons systems. The government is seeking more personnel to operate weaponry like the $4.75 billion Patriot air defense missile system, which first arrived in the country last year.

"We saw the signals and we reacted," said the adviser.

Latvia is moving to increase its mandatory military service for young adults -- which is currently one day a month, over two years -- to three weeks, hoping to draw more army recruits. It is negotiating with the U.S. to acquire rocket artillery and new air and coastal defense systems. And all three Baltic countries are also increasingly pooling resources to combine capabilities, officials said.

Foreign Minister Liimets at the special Foreign Affairs Council: our response to Russia's deadly aggression in Ukraine is unequivocally severe

Yesterday 25 February, Foreign Minister Eva-Maria Liimets was in Brussels for a special meeting of the foreign ministers of the European Union , where they adopted sanction packages against Russia and Belarus and had a video call with Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

"By attacking Ukraine, Russia is not only attacking a free country and nation, it is attacking all of Europe, our peace and the democratic values we cherish. Europe's response to Russia's deadly attack in Ukraine is and will be unequivocally severe. With the sanctions imposed against Russia and Belarus, we are punishing nearly 500 individuals for the attack on Ukraine by freezing their assets and in an unprecedented move, they include President Putin, the head of state of a permanent member of the UN Security Council . The sanctions will also seriously affect Russia's economy, financial system and state companies," Foreign Minister Liimets said. Member states are preparing the next sanctions package.

An important point on the agenda was the humanitarian crisis caused by the war and the deteriorating situation of war refugees. The EU is launching a mechanism for helping the population and sharing the burden of member states bordering Ukraine. "Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to leave their ordinary lives and seek shelter from bombs and missile strikes. Many are trying to leave Ukraine and flee to the west, and it is the duty of us all to support Poland and other border countries deal with the refugees. We are also actively offering consular assistance to make sure our people can return safely from Ukraine to Estonia," Liimets said.

The foreign minister reaffirmed Estonia's unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. "We are standing up for Ukraine in both words and deeds. In addition to sanctions and EU level assistance, Estonia has also provided urgent humanitarian aid to alleviate human suffering in war and the Ministry of Defence has prepared an aid package for the defence forces of Ukraine with medical supplies, anti-tank guns, ammunition and other essential equipment. We are ready to respond to Ukraine's needs quickly to help them protect their country and people," Liimets said.

The Ministry of Defence tweeted an intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine, saying: "The bulk of Putin's ground forces remain more than 30km to the north of Kyiv their advance having been slowed by Ukrainian forces defending Hostomel airfield, a key Russian objective for day one of the conflict.

"Heavy fighting continues around Chernihiv and Kharkiv however both cities remain under Ukrainian control.

"Logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance continue to frustrate the Russian advance.

"Despite continued attempts to supress details of the conflict from the Russian population, the Russian Armed Forces has for the first time been forced to acknowledge suffering casualties."

Russian President Vladimir Putin's nuclear warning is a "big attempt to distract away from his troubles in Ukraine", the Defence Secretary has said.

Ben Wallace did not rule out Mr Putin launching a nuclear attack, and was asked on Sky News whether the Russian leader was "crazy enough" to start a nuclear conflict.

Mr Wallace told Sky News: "I think he has certainly done a lot of irrational things recently."

He added: "I think I'm not going to speculate on what he would or wouldn't do, but that's why we all keep our deterrents at a state of readiness in the West."

Ben Wallace said there were "better ways" to help Ukraine than travelling to join the fighting, for those in the UK without military experience.

The Defence Secretary was asked about comments made by Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on Sunday, where she supported anyone who wished to travel to the country to help fight the Russian invaders.

Mr Wallace told Sky News Ms Truss was right that it was a "just cause", but he said: "If you're keen to help and you're a United Kingdom citizen, come and join our armed forces."

He said: "Look, there are people who will go... I think what I would say is unless you are properly trained, unless you are a - you know - experienced member of an armed forces, I think there are better ways for you to contribute to the security of Ukraine."

The Treasury said the UK would strengthen sanctions by targeting Russia's central bank.

The Government will "take all necessary steps to bring into effect restrictions to prohibit any UK natural or legal persons from undertaking financial transactions involving the (Russian central bank), the Russian National Wealth Fund, and the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation", the Treasury said.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: "These measures demonstrate our determination to apply severe economic sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"We are announcing this action in rapid co-ordination with our US and European allies to move in lockstep once more with our international partners, to demonstrate our steadfast resolve in imposing the highest costs on Russia and to cut her off from the international financial system so long as this conflict persists."

Ben Wallace said the announcements about UK visas already made for Ukrainians were only "a first step".

"We're absolutely looking at all the different range of options we can apply to welcome Ukrainians in need," the Defence Secretary told Sky News.

"The first step is to make sure that Ukrainians who have family here - either settled or dual nationals - that they can come and join them.

"But the second step we will look at (is) about what we do with the refugee flows across the board."

He said the Government would "make decisions in the near future".

Russian forces in Ukraine are "strung out" and "behind schedule", the Defence Secretary has said.

Ben Wallace told Times Radio that President Putin "convinced himself that all these people would somehow welcome them with Russian flags and thank them for being great liberators".

But instead the Ukrainian resistance had made these plans "go awry".

Ben Wallace defended the funding given to British armed forces.

The Defence Secretary said there was confusion between a reduction in the number of soldiers, and cuts in defence overall.

He told Times Radio: "We've got the biggest defence spending increase since the Cold War."

Mr Wallace said the priorities of the armed forces reflected the threats present.

The Russian offensive in Ukraine is likely to become "more violent", the Defence Secretary said.

Ben Wallace told BBC Breakfast that although the Ukrainians were putting up "a very strong fight" the reality was they were going up against "the overwhelming scale of the Russian Federation Army".

He said of Russia: "They are behind schedule, they are taking significant casualties and they are feeling public rejection in parts of the Russian system itself; we've seen many protests.

"But the Russian handbook is to then get more violent and commit more forces because fundamentally in the Russian, sort of, doctrine the lives of their own soldiers matter much less than in other armed forces.

"So we have to brace ourselves for what may come next, which could be ruthless, indiscriminate bombing of cities and propelling forward of soldiers and high casualty levels, and that's going to be horrific."

Vladimir Putin's nuclear warning is part of a "battle of rhetoric", the Defence Secretary said.

Ben Wallace told BBC Breakfast that he understood the concerns about the warning made by the Russian leader, and revealed his own 12-year-old son called him worried about the step.

But he said: "We don't see or recognise in the sort of phrase or the status he described as anything that is a change to what they have currently as their nuclear posture.

"This is predominantly about Putin putting it on the table just to remind people, remind the world, that he has a deterrent."

He added: "We will not do anything to escalate in that area, we will not do anything to feed any miscalculation, we take it very, very seriously.

"But at the moment this is a battle of rhetoric that President Putin is deploying, and we just have to make sure we manage it properly."

Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Tugendhat said minister had indicated the UK is "likely" to follow the EU in taking in Ukrainian refugees for up to three years.

The Conservative MP said he had talked with members of Government who were "hopeful" the policy on taking in Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion would be reviewed within the coming days.

Asked whether the UK Government had gone far enough in offering sanctuary to refugees, Mr Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I've been speaking to ministers this morning and I can tell you there are many who are hopeful that this will be something that's reviewed in the coming days."

Asked about the EU's announcement that member countries would grant asylum to Ukrainian refugees for up to three years, Mr Tugendhat said: "I suspect that's likely to be where we end up to be honest."

"I think there's a definite opportunity to be generous," he added.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he does not "want to see British people killed any more than I want to see Ukrainians" as he urged people in the UK not to join the fighting.

Mr Wallace, who served in the Scots Guards, said although he would "always fight for my country", he would not head to Ukraine as a private citizen now to take part in the conflict.

He joked that he would "probably be reduced by now to be in charge of, at my age, the Home Guard or something".

But he said the situation in Ukraine was "very dangerous" and that citizens should find other ways to support the invaded country.

Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Tugendhat has said Russia sees battlefield nuclear weapons as simply "a bigger bang" and could give a military order to use them.

The Conservative MP told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme: "The Russian military doctrine doesn't work in the same way as the Nato military doctrine. They do assume that they may use battlefield nuclear weapons and they see them as just a, if you'll excuse the expression, a bigger bang. They don't treat fallout in the same way we do."

He added that although the situation was "concerning," it was not unprecedented for Russia to threaten nuclear action.

"That said, Russia has frequently threatened nuclear deployments in the past," he said.

"This is not unusual but at the same time it is concerning and it is not impossible a Russian military order to use battlefield nuclear weapons could be given."

Shares in BP slumped sharply after the markets opened lower again in London.

The oil giant initially dropped by as much as 7%, before moving back to roughly 4% lower at 363p per share following its decision to sell its nearly 20% stake in Russian oil business Rosneft.

The FTSE 100 moved 1.02% - or 79.3 points - lower to 7,412.4 points shortly after the markets opened.

Ireland's Foreign Affairs Minister has said the country will send around nine million euros' worth of non-lethal equipment to Ukraine as part of an EU fund.

"Our money will be used for non-lethal weapons - things like helmets, protection vests, medical kits, fuel," Simon Coveney told RTE radio.

"I think the European Union is right to intervene and support the Ukrainian military who are under enormous pressure at the moment.

"I think if the European Union can't take a stand, well, then I think we have to question the moral substance of the European Union."

Mr Coveney also indicated that Ireland might move to expel some Russian diplomats, but ruled out expelling the ambassador.

"The expulsion of diplomats or Russian staff in embassies is quite a significant thing to do. It sends a very strong signal and Russia will respond in kind.

"I think it's likely that something will happen in that space, but we do need to be targeted. We need to bear in mind the interests of Irish citizens, both in Russia and across Ukraine."

Ben Wallace said he has "no doubt" that Britain will do more to help Ukrainian refugees.

The Defence Secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK has a "very generous" track record in helping those in need of aid.

"I think what I would say is, you know, our track record so far, both with Afghans and (the) Arap scheme, and indeed with the Hong Kong nationals who were suffering persecution, has been actually very generous," he said.

"So there's no reason to doubt we won't continue on that path."

He added that it is not yet clear whether the European Union's approach will be to support refugees on the border, with the hope they will be able to return to Ukraine soon, but discussions are continuing.

Russia should be banned from all international sporting and cultural events, shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell has said.

The Labour MP told Sky News: "We need to send a clear and categoric message that Russia from now on will be fully excluded, fully boycotted from all international sporting and cultural events."

Sports bodies such as Uefa and "to some degree" Fifa have started to make "moves in the right direction" to stop Russia's involvement, but a blanket ban is needed "without delay", she said.

With forthcoming competitions such as the World Cup and the European Women's Football Championship, "it shouldn't be a case that Russia can still take part albeit without displaying its country's name", she added.

Ms Powell told the programme: "We now need to see a full and clear categoric signal so that (President Vladimir) Putin, who takes these occasions very seriously when he is hosting or participating in these events, he needs to feel the full force of that where it hurts, and it will send a strong signal to the Russian people as well that they need to stand up to Putin because they will no longer be able to take pride in their country taking part in such events."

She added that Russia is still hosting international volleyball and swimming competitions later this year.

The UK needs a "radical rethink" of its foreign and defence policy following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell has said.

Describing the current situation as "one of the most terrifying eras of my lifetime", she told Sky News: "We didn't ever think, as a generation, that we would see such a breach of those international norms we have been living with for decades with an illegal invasion of a European country on our doorstep by Russia - that is going to require a radical rethink in terms of our public policy, foreign policy and defence policy and so on.

"I think the UK, Nato, the West - we are really waking up to that new threat.

"We have a united agenda here now. We have seen tough action but it could be tougher still.

"We want the UK Government and we want other governments to go further when it comes to those economic sanctions tackling the oligarchs that take safe haven in our country, when it comes to things like sporting and cultural sanctions, and also when it comes to increasing that military aid directly into Ukraine so the Ukrainian people can defend themselves."

Life has been "a rollercoaster" over the past few weeks, according to a UK expat who is now in Poland after deciding it was too dangerous to stay with his family in Kyiv.

Stuart McKenzie told Sky News he initially wanted to stay and "support Ukraine" but decided with his wife that "if there was any danger to our children - that is the point we would have to leave the city".

They left at 4.30am and could hear "bombs dropping in Kyiv" as they went.

Mr McKenzie, who said the Polish have been "fantastic and very flexible" in its support of the Ukrainian people, told the programme: "Everything is so fluid. We do not have any medium or long-term goals - it is just all about survival. It is about getting the people we love out of the country.

"There was a tsunami of refugees at the border right now desperate to get out. It is getting more and more difficult every hour.

"People cannot afford to keep their cars warm because they can't afford to spend the fuel to turn on the engines and to do that for three or four nights in a row with children and elderly.

"My brother has seen someone who has passed away because they were elderly and just died of cold. It is a terrible situation."

Britain is "on the back foot" in helping Ukraine's refugees and "the Government just needs to step up and support people who are fleeing war and terror," the chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee has said.

Meg Hiller, the Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, told Sky News: "I think the EU has set the tone here and Britain is on the back foot.

"Britain have done the same with Afghanistan in making it hard for family members to join.

"It needs to understand that family members are one of the easiest groups to get into the country, with support here already embedded.

"People have got homes, jobs and money to support their family members but it could go much further," Dame Meg added.

"It needs to follow what the EU is doing and we hope, of course, that these refugees will only be temporarily here.

"They want to go back to Ukraine once we hope this conflict is over. In the meantime, the Government just needs to step up and support people who are fleeing war and terror."

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has claimed that Vladimir Putin placed nuclear deterrence forces on high alert after statements from Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.

According to the Interfax news agency, Mr Peskov told a press briefing: "Statements were made by various representatives at various levels on possible altercations or even collisions and clashes between Nato and Russia.

"We believe that such statements are absolutely unacceptable.

"I would not call the authors of these statements by name, although it was the British foreign minister."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is due to make a statement to MPs on sanctions at 3.30pm, the House of Commons has said.

The Irish premier has cast doubt on the idea that Ukraine may be able to join the EU with immediate effect.

Speaking in Dublin, Micheal Martin said: "I don't know whether it can be done immediately.

"But I certainly would be a proponent and supporter of accelerating it and making it very clear that they can become members of the European Union.

"I've always favoured the acceleration of the European perspective for countries in our neighbourhood."

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng will also make a statement on the economic crime measures, the Commons said.

The Taoiseach has said that the decision by Ireland to fund items such as PPE, medical equipment and supplies for Ukraine, as part of a wider EU package, does not undermine the country's longstanding military neutrality.

"Our contribution to the non-lethal strand of that peace facility does not undermine our military neutrality," Micheal Martin told reporters in Dublin.

"We are not politically neutral, and have never been politically neutral in the sense that we uphold democratic values and democratic principles."

An ally of Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has struck back at the Kremlin's claims her remarks played a role in Vladimir Putin ordering Russia's nuclear deterrent on high alert.

"Nothing Liz has said warrants that sort of escalation. It's clearly designed to distract from the situation on the ground in Ukraine," the ally said.

"The Foreign Secretary has always talked about Nato in the context of it being a defensive alliance. Her point is that we stand by Article 5, and that we must do everything we can to help Ukraine short of putting boots on the ground.

"We take it very seriously and want to keep the situation calm."

Boris Johnson will travel to Poland and Estonia for meetings with his counterparts and Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday, Downing Street has said.

Downing Street has said the sweeping sanctions brought in over Russia's invasion of Ukraine are designed to "bring down the Putin regime".

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "The Prime Minister's view is that Putin's regime, and Putin, must be treated like a pariah state and businesses should think very carefully if they are still continuing to do anything that props up the Putin regime.

"The United Kingdom, the Prime Minister, is very clear that we do not want to unnecessarily inflict damage on the Russian people, many of whom are bravely taking to the streets to protest this violence, this invasion.

"But the measures we're introducing, that large parts of the world are introducing, are to bring down the Putin regime, and we think anyone who is actively seeking to support any elements of the Putin regime should think very carefully."

Pressed whether the measures are intended and provoking a regime change, he said: "Yes, the sanctions we've introduced, the widespread sanctions, aim to inflict financial pain on Putin and his regime to stymie the Russia war machine as it attempts to subjugate a democratic European country."

Downing Street has effectively contradicted Foreign Secretary Liz Truss after she said she would support Britons who chose to help Ukrainian troops fight Russia.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "We think the best way we can help Ukraine right now is by ensuring Putin fails. There are a number of ways Brits can show their support for that, and the Ukrainian embassy in London is putting out information about how British can support.

"We fully recognise the strength of feeling about British people wanting to support the Ukrainians following the Russian invasion. There's advice up on travelling to Ukraine, we currently advise against travel to Ukraine."

Downing Street has said Priti Patel will say more on further actions to help Ukrainian refugees flee Ukraine.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "We've set out further measures last night but we will be doing even more, with the Home Secretary expected to say a little more in the House later today.

"As the Prime Minister has said, we will go further than even what was announced yesterday, there will be further support as you would expect for those who are fleeing the violence."

Boris Johnson opened Cabinet by saying Vladimir Putin had made a "colossal mistake" believing his troops would be "garlanded with roses" by Ukrainians.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "The Prime Minister said it is becoming clearer with each day that Putin had made a colossal mistake believing that the guns of his tanks would be garlanded with roses when instead the Ukrainian people had put up a fierce resistance in defence of their homeland.

"He said latest intelligence suggested Putin's advances had been hampered by logistical problems and the heroic efforts of the Ukrainian military who are inflicting significant casualties on Russian troops."

Media mogul Evgeny Lebedev has used The Evening Standard newspaper to appeal to Vladimir Putin to stop the invasion of Ukraine.

Writing in the newspaper, which he owns, the crossbench peer - addressing Mr Putin - said: "I plead with you to use today's negotiations to bring this terrible conflict in Ukraine to an end."

In a statement published alongside a photograph of a paramedic performing CPR on a girl injured by shelling, Lord Lebedev said: "On this page are the final minutes of a six-year-old child fatally injured by shells that struck her Mariupol apartment block on Sunday.

"She is still wearing her pink jacket as medics fight to save her. But it is too late. Other children, and other families, are suffering similar fates across Ukraine.

"As a Russian citizen I plead with you to stop Russians killing their Ukrainian brothers and sisters."

"As a British citizen I ask you to save Europe from war. As a Russian patriot I plead that you prevent any more young Russian soldiers from dying needlessly. As a citizen of the world I ask you to save the world from annihilation."

Adding to the account of the Cabinet meeting, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said of Mr Johnson: "He said Putin had also underestimated Western unity and the strength of the sanctions his action could lead to.

"The Prime Minister said Putin must fail in his attempts to subjugate Ukraine and the UK would continue its efforts in three main areas to achieve this: economically, diplomatically and militarily."

Mr Johnson will press for Russia to be cut out of the Swift international payment system "completely", with the spokesman adding: "Further sanctions on Russian businesses and individuals will be introduced shortly."

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said Cabinet was updated by the chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee and the Chief of the Defence staff who "pointed to the discontent among many of the Russian people including an anti-war petition that has attracted around a million signatures".

Downing Street said Home Office minister Kevin Foster was right to delete his tweet suggesting the seasonal worker scheme was a route for Ukrainian people to flee war.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "I think that tweet was rightly deleted, I think the UK has a proud history of supporting those in need. We've done that with Afghanistan and elsewhere and we will continue to do that."

Not waiving visa requirements for people fleeing the Russian invasion in Ukraine risks being "embarrassing for the UK", Scotland's First Minister has said.

Nicola Sturgeon has voiced her support for allowing people into the country allowing for "the paperwork (to) be sorted out later on", and has now called on the Prime Minister to step in.

"I think the UK's current position on refuge for people fleeing from Ukraine is unacceptable and if it doesn't change and change substantially very soon, it risks - at a time when we should be building maximum unity - being embarrassing for the UK," she said during a visit to Aberdeen.

"I am calling on the Prime Minister, I am appealing to the Prime Minister to follow the example of Ireland, follow the example of the entire European Union and have a situation, effectively, where anyone from Ukraine who is seeking refuge in the UK is allowed entry to the UK with no visa requirements and the paperwork can be sorted later on.

"The position announced by the Prime Minister last night restricting that kind of approach not even just to family members of people already here but to immediate family members is woefully inadequate.

"It doesn't meet the moment, this is a time to step up and do everything we can to support Ukrainians and I hope we will see significant movement from the UK Government over the course of today."

Downing Street suggested law firms seeking to protect Russian oligarchs from sanctions could themselves be targeted with strict measures.

"We will certainly keep all options under review," the Prime Minister's official spokesman said.

"This is an incredibly serious situation and we want to take all possible steps to ratchet up the pressure on Putin and his regime to get him to step back from this path.

"Individuals or businesses that are seeking to facilitate that regime and Putin's actions, to continue down this path of violence, we think should step back from that as well."

The spokesman said it was "not helpful to name individual businesses" but "clearly I think it's important everyone thinks carefully about how they may be, even inadvertently, supporting a country or a regime which has invaded another democratic country".

Boris Johnson does not believe football's ruling body has gone far enough to sanction the Russian team.

Fifa stopped short of excluding Russia from the men's World Cup play-offs due to take place next month, instead ordering the team to play on neutral territory, behind closed doors and as the Football Union of Russia.

"The Prime Minister wants Fifa to take the strongest possible action on this and doesn't think their current measures go far enough," Mr Johnson's official spokesman said.

"I think anyone seeing the situation and the horrific scenes we see on the ground would expect a body like Fifa to do more."

The spokesman said Mr Johnson "wholeheartedly welcomes" the Football Association's confirmation that England will not play Russia.

"We do think that Russia should be cut out not just economically but culturally as well to further up the pressure on Putin."

No 10 said the Prime Minister's official spokesman "misspoke" when he said Western sanctions "are to bring down the Putin regime".

The spokesman went on to say: "We're not seeking anything in terms of regime change. What we're talking about here clearly is how we stop Russia seeking to subjugate a democratic country."

Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, opening the sitting in the Commons, said: "Before we begin today's business, I wish to thank (Chris Bryant, Labour MP for Rhondda) for withdrawing his invitation to the Russian ambassador to address the APPG (all-party parliamentary group) on Russia.

"I was very uneasy about the visit and did not think it appropriate to invite a Russian official who had said only weeks before that there would be no invasion."

Sir Lindsay added MPs "stand in solidarity" with Ukraine and its people - and the country's flag has been raised at the Commons.

The One Nation Caucus of Tory MPs has written to Boris Johnson calling for him to do more to help Ukrainians fleeing the fighting.

Former Cabinet ministers Sir Robert Buckland, Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock were among senior MPs to put their names to the letter calling for a "flexible and pragmatic approach" to allow Ukrainians to seek temporary refuge in the UK.

The 38 MPs said: "We need to act now and we need to act decisively.

"We urge the UK Government to provide as much support as possible to our European partners who are currently the first safe havens for Ukrainian refugees - namely Poland, Moldova, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia.

"We also hope our ministers will seek a flexible and pragmatic approach to those Ukrainians wishing to seek temporary refuge in the UK until it is safe to return to their lives in their home country.

"It is clear that this is not another migration crisis; this is a crisis of war. This should not be business as usual, we need sincere and immediate support for the Ukrainian people.

"The United Kingdom cannot flag or fail, our message must be clear: Ukrainian victims of war seeking refuge are welcome."

Nicola Sturgeon has dismissed claims that Russia put its nuclear weapons on high alert because of comments by Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.

The Kremlin claimed that Vladimir Putin raised the alert level of Russia's nuclear deterrent after "absolutely unacceptable" remarks by Ms Truss.

Reacting to the claim, Scotland's First Minister said Mr Putin was solely responsible for the "despicable" threat.

Ms Sturgeon tweeted: "Whatever political disagreements any of us have with Liz Truss - and I have many deep differences with her - we should not fall for this transparent Russian attempt to divert.

"The only person responsible for Putin's despicable nuclear threat is Putin."

Boris Johnson spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday afternoon, committing to send more military support "in the coming hours and days".

A Downing Street spokeswoman said: "The President updated the Prime Minister on the Ukrainian resistance to the ongoing Russian invasion. The Prime Minister commended his bravery and that of the Ukrainian people.

"The leaders categorically condemned the barbaric airstrikes being carried out by Russia against innocent civilians, including children.

"The Prime Minister updated President Zelensky on UK military support being sent to Ukraine and committed to sending more in the coming hours and days."

The Government will aim to "learn from best practice" in immigration law after "recent days" in which the Republic of Ireland was able to easily offer asylum to Ukrainians fleeing war.

SNP MP Martin Docherty-Hughes (West Dunbartonshire) said: "It is often overlooked that this political stage shares a common travel area with our neighbours across the Irish Sea.

"I daresay from citizenship frameworks to asylum policy this Government has a lot of learn from Ireland about implementing humane and just policy for those coming to the UK.

"Can I ask the minister what steps their department is taking, if any, in recent days to learn from best practice seen in the Republic of Ireland in terms of their legislative frameworks for citizenship?"

Home Office minister Kevin Foster replied: "We always look at the practices in other countries. I would point out things like our visitor route is more generous than the equivalent in the Republic of Ireland.

"Actually, I am meeting an Irish minister later today. But we are looking at how we can amend nationality law to make it slightly easier in terms of processes that we no longer need to look into people's past migration history when we have already recently done that."

Home Office minister Kevin Foster, when challenged in the Commons, did not apologise for a tweet suggesting the seasonal worker scheme was a route for Ukrainian people to flee war, as Labour hit out at Government "incompetence".

Shadow Home Office minister Stephen Kinnock said Labour supports the calls the Welsh and Scottish governments have made "to offer sanctuary to Ukrainians who are fleeing the horrors of war".

He said: "The UK Government's response on this matter has once again demonstrated the toxic combination of incompetence and indifference that are the hallmarks of this Home Secretary and her ministerial team."

He criticised Mr Foster's now-deleted tweet as "the modern-day equivalent of let them eat cake" and asked for him to "unconditionally apologise", and offer "swift, well-managed and safe sanctuary to these victims of Putin's barbarity who require our support".

Mr Foster did not directly respond to the request for an apology but said: "I'm interested to contrast those comments to what the Ukrainian ambassador said yesterday."

He said the Home Secretary will "shortly announce more" and added, "it was very useful to have a constructive conversation with the Scottish Government on Friday".

The SNP said the UK Government is "alone amongst our European allies in asking Ukrainians to jump through visa hoops to reach sanctuary here".

SNP home affairs spokesperson Stuart C McDonald said in the Commons: "The minister will have heard loud and clear during that call with Neil Gray on Friday that the Scottish Government fully supports replicating the European model and lifting visa requirements for Ukrainian nationals now.

"The UK Government is now alone amongst our European allies in asking Ukrainians to jump through visa hoops to reach sanctuary here.

"It is even more alone in legislating to criminalise, marginalise and impoverish those who seek asylum through its anti-refugee bill. Surely basic human decency requires an urgent rethink on both those counts?"

Home Office minister Kevin Foster said the Home Secretary "will shortly say a bit more on what we're looking to do around Ukrainians".

He added: "One thing that would certainly help us be able to support more of those seeking asylum in this country is if 31 out of 32 local authority areas in Scotland weren't refusing to be a dispersal area, including his own."

Home secretary Priti Patel told MPs: "Putin's war on Ukraine is monstrous and unjustified."

She said: "Through this extension alone I can confirm that an additional 100,000 Ukrainians will be able to seek sanctuary in the UK, with access to work and public services.

"We are enabling Ukrainian nationals already in the UK, giving them the ability to switch free of charge into a points-based immigration route or through the family visa route.

"We are extending visas for (Ukraine) temporary workers in some sectors and they can now stay until at least December 2022."

Home secretary Priti Patel told MPs: "Our new route will continue to keep pace with the developing situation on the ground and so far has already supported hundreds of British nationals and their families resident in Ukraine to leave.

"The UK visas and immigration staff continue to work around the clock to assist them."

She added: "We are in direct contact with individuals and we've also lowered various requirements and salary thresholds so that people can be supported.

"Where family members of British nationals do not meet the usual eligibility criteria, but pass security checks, UK visas and immigration will give them the permission to enter the UK outside the rules for 12 months and is prioritising all applications.

"Giving British nationals and any person settled in the UK the ability to bring over their immediate Ukrainian family members."

Priti Patel said Ukraine has requested that the Russian government be suspended from its membership of Interpol, adding: "We'll be leading all international efforts to that effect."

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: "The Home Secretary has just said she is announcing a bespoke humanitarian route but it's extremely unclear from what she's said what the details actually are or who it will apply to."

Labour former minister Chris Bryant also told Home Office questions: "Will the Home Secretary publish her review into the tier one gold-plated visas? Will she suspend all tier one visas for people who have connections with the Putin regime?

"Will she also look into the veracity of the applications for British citizenship by Russian oligarchs who are connected with Putin?"

Ms Patel replied in the Commons: "I think (Mr Bryant) knows my view and position on this, and, of course, the answer is yes."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said that the situation is "fluid" but as of Monday President Vladimir Putin has not taken any major cities.

Updating the House on the United Kingdom's support for Ukraine in the face of Mr Putin's "pre-meditated, pre-planned and barbaric invasion", Ms Truss said: "Ukraine has suffered horrific attacks, missiles and air strikes who've torn through apartment blocks.

"Tanks have rolled into once peaceful cities, innocent people, including children who've lost their lives. The situation is fluid.

"But as of today Putin has not taken any major cities. Their advance has been slowed by Ukraine's fierce resistance."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion is "not proceeding to plan".

She said: "He expected to take cities quickly. He expected Ukraine to retreat and he expected the West to be divided.

"Instead, his forces were met by the heroic heroism of President Zelensky and the resolute determination of the Ukrainian people.

"He has been met by a united West, together with our friends around the world, and we have taken decisive action.

"Today we have acted with the US, the EU, Japan and Canada to cut Russia's central bank off from our markets. The rouble has fallen by over 40% as a result, as much as 250 billion dollars have been wiped off the Russian stock market and today their stock market is closed."

Telling the Commons she is "determined to go much, much further" with actions against Russia, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she would sanction the country's largest bank with a new law.

Ms Truss told MPs: "Today I can inform the House I will be laying two new pieces of sanctions legalisation.

"The first introduces a set of new powers against Russia's financial sector. It includes powers to prevent Russian banks from clearing payments in sterling.

"With over 50% of Russian trade denominated in dollars or sterling, our co-ordinated action with the United States will damage Russia's ability to trade with the world.

"As soon as this legislation comes into force, we will apply it to Sberbank, Russia's largest bank."

The UK and Western allies will have to undergo "some economic hardship as a result of our sanctions", Liz Truss has said.

The Foreign Secretary told the Commons: "The days ahead are likely to prove tougher still. The UK and our allies will have to undergo some economic hardship as a result of our sanctions.

"But our hardships are nothing compared to those endured by the people of Ukraine.

"Casualty numbers are rising and over 300,000 people have already been displaced. This is a struggle for Ukraine's freedom and self-determination, but it is also a struggle for freedom and democracy everywhere. And for a survival of a Europe whole and free."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss confirmed she would sanction a further three Russian banks in light of the invasion of Ukraine.

"I will also be imposing a full asset freeze on three further banks," Ms Truss told the Commons, naming "Russia's national development bank" among the newly-sanctioned institutions.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said new legislation will isolate Russian companies from access to UK capital markets and ban exports to Russia across a range of "critical sectors".

She said in the Commons that new legislation "will prevent the Russian state from raising debt here. And it will isolate all Russian companies - that's over three million businesses - from accessing UK capital markets".

She said a second piece of legislation "will ban exports to Russia across a range of critical sectors. This includes high-end technological equipment" including marine and navigation equipment which "will blunt Russia's military industrial capabilities and act as a drag on Russia's economy for years to come".

Ms Truss said: "I appreciate the consequences of this step for British people and British businesses operating in Russia."

She said the Government will offer "advice and guidance" to affected UK businesses and consular staff will continue to support British nationals in Russia and Ukraine.

In an update to its travel advice, the Foreign Office website said: "The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) advises against all travel to the whole of Russia due to the lack of available flight options to return to the UK, and the increased volatility in the Russian economy."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK will "keep ratcheting up our response" to Russia.

She said: "More legislation will follow in coming weeks in sanctioning Russian-occupied territories in the Donbas, extending more sanctions to Belarus, and limiting Russian deposits in UK banks.

"We will continue working through our hitlist of oligarchs, focusing on their houses, their yachts and every aspect of their lives. In addition, we will be introducing the Economic Crime Bill tomorrow."

She said: "This is all about flushing out the oligarch dirty money from the United Kingdom. We will continue work with our G7 allies to cut off the Russian economy and cut the free world's dependence on Russian gas. Depriving Putin of his key source of revenue."

She said the UK is "leading the diplomatic effort to ensure there is a chorus of condemnation against President Putin".

Ms Truss said: "Putin is isolated. No-one is willing to back his war of choice."

Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said: "We have all been inspired by the gallant and tenacious actions of Ukrainians in defence of their country. This is true courage under fire."

He added: "We must not let our focus slip for even a second. We will continue to stand united with our allies and partners supporting Ukraine and opposing this outrageous campaign of aggression.

"Putin is not only facing a united West, he is facing a truly United Kingdom. Together we have enacted sanctions that are having a strong effect."

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he has written to all UK ports to ask they deny access to Russian flagged, registered or operated vessels.

He tweeted: "Today I've written to all UK ports asking them not to provide access to any Russian flagged, registered, owned, controlled, chartered or operated vessels.

"Given Putin's action in £Ukraine I've made clear these vessels are NOT welcome here with prohibiting legislation to follow."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said President Vladimir Putin's war could last for years and she told Ukrainians "we are prepared to suffer economic sacrifices to support you".

She said she met on Sunday with G7 foreign ministers, joined by Ukraine's foreign minister, saying: "Everyone is clear Putin must lose and we will carry on increasing the pressure until he does.

"We have all seen Ukraine's determination to fight.

"Putin's war could end up lasting for months and years. So, I say to our Ukrainian friends: we are with you. In Britain and around the world we are prepared to suffer economic sacrifices to support you. However long it takes, we will not rest until Ukraine's sovereignty is restored."

In his letter to all UK ports, Mr Shapps said the maritime sector "must play our part" in sanctioning Russia over Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

He wrote: "Russia's assault on Ukraine is an unprovoked, premeditated attack against a sovereign democratic state. The UK Government has been clear there would be massive consequences and a severe cost for any Russian military incursion into Ukraine, and, in co-ordination with our international allies and partners, we are developing an unprecedented package of further sanctions.

"The maritime sector is fundamental to international trade and we must play our part in restricting Russia's economic interests and holding the Russian government to account.

"In these circumstances the Department for Transport does not consider it appropriate for Russian vessels to continue to enter UK ports. From this point onwards, UK ports are asked not to provide access to any ship which they have reason to believe is: Owned, controlled, chartered, or operated by any person connected with Russia owned, controlled, chartered or operated by designated persons flying the Russian flag registered in Russia.

"We will seek to support UK ports in identifying Russian ships within scope of the above and will communicate directly with relevant ports when we identify ships bound for UK ports who fall within scope of the above.

"Further detailed sanctions against Russian shipping are being developed and further details will be shared very shortly."

Ivan Babuscsak, from Uzhhorod, who is studying at Napier University in Edinburgh, said Ukraine is "fighting for Europe" and praised Ukrainian soldiers as he called on the whole world to support his homeland.

Mr Babuscsak, a member of the Edinburgh branch of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, also said the nuclear threat is "going on already, it's not just about bombs" as nuclear power stations are under threat amid the Russian invasion.

He told the PA news agency: "Finally, after all this help that Europe and America and Canada and other countries, now Japan today, are sending us, it's all thanks to our soldiers, they showed for the first few days, they showed that we will fight for our country and unfortunately the western world does not realise that we, a European nation, we are going to fight for our country.

"All we need is the whole world just to support us. We don't want any land forces from other countries, we just need the support, because what we are doing now, we are fighting for Europe now, not just for our own country.

"You would understand this if you would know Russians."

Mr Babuscsak has been keeping in touch with his parents and relatives in Ukraine and said that people are doing all they can to help each other.

He said: "My family are in Ukraine but I've been lucky, my region is the only region that has not been bombed but at the same time we've got a lot of refugees so all my friends are involved in any kind of volunteering, some helping with the Red Cross, some making food, doing anything they can do for people."

Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, sought assurances that monies frozen and seized will be held and returned to the Russian people "when this criminal conspiracy that laughably calls itself a government falls" and they have a "proper administration" to which it can be returned.

He also suggested countries join together to create a single fund for a "repayment mechanism for the damage done to Ukraine and the rebuilding of Russia in due course".

Liz Truss replied: "Our issue is not with the Russian people, many of whom are now protesting against this appalling regime, it is with Putin and his cronies - that is who we're targeting with our hit on oligarchs and he is right that that money should be protected, and I'll look into the idea he's put forward."

SNP foreign affairs spokesman Alyn Smith supported the sanctions but said he would "urge more", including on refugees, telling MPs: "The UK needs to waive visas, not flags."

Ms Truss replied in the Commons: "We're creating a new Ukrainian humanitarian route to enable families of British nationals to come into the United Kingdom and this will mean an additional 100,000 Ukrainians are able to seek sanctuary in the United Kingdom."

Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said: "Labour's priority is to cut off Putin's rogue state from our economic system and to undermine his campaign of aggression in Ukraine."

On sanctions, he added: "The moves to finally clamp down on dirty money so long demanded by Labour and colleagues across the House are long overdue.

"It's regrettable that it's taken this long and a crisis of this nature for action, but we welcome the steps and will study them carefully, but there's still more the Government can do."

He added: "The Government should go further to ensure sanctions can be placed against Russia's extractive industries, energy industries and technological industries.

"It's vital that these sanctions are broad enough to inflict damage on every aspect of Russia's economy."

Responding, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: "What we are seeing is Putin is completely isolated, there is nobody else backing him up in these international fora and there is a growing group of countries who are prepared to put sanctions on, who are prepared to supply defensive weapons, and we are leading the charge in bringing those countries on board."

She added: "We are looking at more sanctions on the energy industry, the technology industry."

Liz Truss said Belarus will face further sanctions for its "complicity" in the "abhorrent invasion" of Ukraine.

Ms Truss, in reply to Labour former minister Dame Margaret Hodge, told the Commons: "Members of the Duma can and will be sanctioned, we're working through the list of members in the same way as we're working through our hit list of oligarchs, and I will look into the issues around Kazakhstan and other nations.

"We're already sanctioning Belarus and we're shortly imposing more sanctions on Belarus for the complicity in this abhorrent invasion."

Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the Defence Committee, pressed the UK to put in a resolution at the UN General Assembly to ensure China is "obliged to follow" restrictions being placed on Russia via sanctions.

Ms Truss acknowledged the need to ensure there is "not sanctions leakage into other countries".

She added: "I did speak to my Chinese counterpart. The Chinese did not vote with the Russians at the UN Security Council.

"I'm making it very clear to China and other major nations of their responsibilities to protect the sovereignty and self-determination of Ukraine, and we continue to put pressure on them."

The Liberal Democrats have urged the Government to seize the money of Russian oligarchs "no matter where the money may or may not be transferred to".

Foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran mentioned Russian-Israeli billionaire Roman Abramovich, who she said "curiously, a couple of days ago decided to transfer ... or I'll say it out loud, wanted to transfer Chelsea FC into some kind of trust".

She added: "The concern, of course, is that oligarchs are working with their lawyers and accountants to do the same.

"Can she assure this House that we will not stop, we will follow the money and no matter where the money may or may not be transferred to, we will find it and we will seize it?"

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss replied: "I can assure the honourable lady that that is exactly what we are doing. We have a very large team of people working through our hit list of oligarchs and we are also looking at their properties, their ownerships of yachts. We have already grounded their private jets."

Mr Abramovich handed "stewardship and care" of Chelsea to the club foundation's trustees on Saturday in a move aimed to protect the Stamford Bridge club, but now the 55-year-old is said to be trying to help bring an end to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Mr Abramovich's spokesperson told the PA news agency: "I can confirm that Roman Abramovich was contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution and that he has been trying to help ever since. Considering what is at stake, we would ask for your understanding as to why we have not commented on neither the situation as such nor his involvement."

Sanctions against Russia should only end once "every inch" of Ukrainian land, including Crimea, is returned, the Foreign Secretary has agreed.

Conservative MP for Elmet and Rothwell Alec Shelbrooke asked: "Does the Foreign Secretary agree with me that the sanctions regime needs to stay in place until every inch of Ukrainian territory is back in Ukrainian control, including Crimea?"

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss replied: "Yes, I completely agree with him."

Elsewhere in the debate, Conservative chair of the intelligence and security committee Julian Lewis said: "Does she accept that the right way to deal with a robotic, sneering psychopath firmly in the grip of small-man syndrome is not to impose sanctions in a piecemeal and gradually escalating way, but to seek to inflect maximum economic pain at the earliest possible moment?"

Ms Truss said: "Yes is the answer, and that is what we are doing. We are pushing as hard as we can for the toughest possible sanctions. This is the biggest package of sanctions the UK has ever put in place in our history and we want to do even more, and we want to push it with our allies."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked Boris Johnson for more anti-tank missiles during their telephone conversation on Monday.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman told reporters: "They had a good conversation - they are speaking almost daily now, as you know.

"In terms of the kit (the UK is sending to Ukraine), I can't get into full details but it will include further anti-tank missiles and other equipment directly requested by President Zelensky and the Ukrainian government.

"They didn't in the call go through the list but from time to time President Zelensky asks for specific bits of kit or equipment and, whenever feasible, we are seeking to deliver it. And, as I say, we are almost up to daily deliveries now across the border."

Asked if the equipment was being flown to Poland and taken by road to Ukraine, the No 10 spokesman replied: "Broadly.

"I won't go into any more specifics. There are reasons why we don't go into exactly how we are getting it across but, broadly speaking, yes, we are unable to fly it directly in."

The UK Government is "looking at" secondary sanctions against companies which may step in to "the gap left in trade" to "profiteer" from the invasion of Ukraine, Liz Truss confirmed.

Conservative former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "Can I ... ask her whether she would consider secondary sanctions, that is to say sanctions not against Russian entities, but against entities in other countries that seek to profit from the gap left in trade?

"It is totally unacceptable for others to profiteer from this invasion, but also will increase the pressure on Russia, as we know it did successfully on Iran."

Foreign Secretary Ms Truss replied: "Yes, we are looking at that, and he is 100% right."

Downing Street said Boris Johnson would be using his Monday afternoon call with G7 and other world leaders to see what can be done to "further up the pressure" on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking to reporters, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "The aim is to see what more we can do to dissuade Putin from continuing down this path.

"You have seen how last week the EU, the US, the UK and many other countries came together with a strong sanctions package and other means.

"The donors conference that (Defence Secretary) Ben Wallace attended saw lots of countries who hadn't previously done so commit to defensive military aid. We want to see more of that.

"The Prime Minister will be talking about the need to go further on things like Swift and pushing for that.

"So, I can't pre-empt exactly what they will discuss, but certainly all of them will want to be talking about what more can be done, in a unified sense, to further up the pressure."

The Government is looking at ways to target the families of Russian oligarchs and the people who work for them, Liz Truss has said.

The Foreign Secretary's comments come as Conservative former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith insisted that oligarchs are mostly in possession of Vladimir Putin's own personal fortune, which is "squirrelled away through their accounts".

He said: "We should remind everybody that the oligarchs are mostly in possession of Putin's own personal fortune, which is something in the order of 200 to 250 billion dollars squirrelled away through their accounts.

"But she will be hamstrung slightly because although we pursue the oligarchs and their money, it is still not mandatory, it is still not an offence for those who have worked for them, their lawyers, their estate agents and all the others, if they fail to give up the information about what other deals that they have done.

"So, can she now introduce in the Bill, make it mandatory for all those in the chain, that if they fail to immediately - someone who is sanctioned - to pass that information up directly, they will themselves be committing a criminal offence?"

Ms Truss replied: "My right honourable friend makes a very good point and we are absolutely looking at what we can do to target the families of oligarchs, the people that work for them, the people that support them, and the people that enable them because, ultimately, all of these people are supporting the Putin regime. And we ultimately need to stop the financing of that regime."

Boris Johnson spoke to Polish President Andrzej Duda ahead of his visit to the country on Tuesday.

"The Prime Minister thanked President Duda for his close collaboration and support to ensure vital defensive and humanitarian aid reached Ukraine," a Downing Street spokeswoman said.

"They both agreed on the need to continue to work with international partners on sanctions measures.

"Sharing their condemnation of the Russian attacks on Ukraine, the leaders paid tribute to the Ukrainian people and their bravery in the recent hours and days.

"The Prime Minister set out the UK's support to mitigate against the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the region, including the £40 million package he announced yesterday, and said the UK stood ready to support Poland further as Ukrainians sought refuge over the border."

SNP MP Brendan O'Hara (Argyll and Bute) asked why Russian state-owned oil tankers were still allowed to use UK ports.

He said: "Why, when we're imposing such harsh economic sanctions on the Kremlin, are we continuing to allow Russian state-owned oil tankers to go freely about their business?"

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss replied: "They won't be going about their business freely for much longer."

Raising the Russian embassy, Labour's Chris Bryant (Rhondda) argued: "I don't really understand why the Prime Minister said last Thursday that we weren't going to engage in cultural or sporting boycotts, because we certainly should.

"We should throw every single thing we've got at the Russians and, finally, I don't understand why the Prime Minister also said last Thursday that we're not going to be sending any Russian diplomats back home.

"Surely we should at least be cutting the Russian embassy here by a half or three-quarters, if not deciding that, frankly, the ambassador who has lied through his teeth to this House should go back home."

Ms Truss replied: "We have a hit list of oligarchs that we are working through ... the Culture Secretary is taking a very tough line on cultural activities and we've seen a number of sporting events already cancelled."

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng made a statement in the House of Commons on reforms the Government will be bringing forward to "improve transparency of the ownership of companies and properties in the UK".

Mr Kwarteng said these reforms will "strengthen the enforcement of financial sanctions".

He added: "The openness of our economy to investment from all parts of the world is one of our greatest strengths. However, we're equally determined that we want to attract the right kind of investment.

"As many people in this House will know, oligarchs and kleptocrats from Russia and elsewhere have used the veneer of legitimacy provided by UK-registered companies and partnerships, and they have also used the high-end property to help launder proceeds of corruption."

Liz Truss warned the BBC risks being banned in Russia if the UK Government takes action against the Russian state-backed broadcaster RT.

In response to a question from SNP MP Chris Law (Dundee West), Ms Truss told the Commons: "We are looking at what can be done on RT but the reality is that if we ban RT in the United Kingdom, that is likely to lead to channels like the BBC being banned in Russia.

"What we want is the Russian population to hear the truth about what Vladimir Putin is doing, so there's a very careful judgment to be made, and that is something the Culture Secretary is looking at."

Conservative former minister Jonathan Djanogly said: "I realised that the Government really understood the nature of sanctioning oligarchs when the sanctions on Aeroflot were extended to private jets.

"In that vein, will (Ms Truss) now consider banning insurance for Russian yachts and jets, which will be worldwide application, and make life a lot tougher for those concerned?"

Ms Truss replied: "Nothing is off the table."

Conservative Felicity Buchan (Kensington) said: "At the moment we are freezing assets of those sanctioned, would she consider putting a charge onto those assets, monetising the charge now and using the money raised to pay for the support of refugees in eastern Europe, and ultimately to rebuild Ukraine?"

Ms Truss replied: "I thank (her) for her very innovative idea and I will certainly have a look at that."

Labour's Liam Byrne (Birmingham, Hodge Hill) urged the Government to "speed up the process of hitting the people on the hit list".

Ms Truss replied: "This is a concerted endeavour where all of us are doing all we can as quickly as we can to show unity and deliver a massive hit to the Russian economy ... There are areas where we are going a lot further than our allies, there are some areas where they have gone further than us, but what we need to do is continue to make progress together."

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said that in light of Russia's "outrageous actions" in recent days, it is "necessary that we put these criminals on notice and send a clear message that the UK will not tolerate their corruption here".

He said: "To that end, I'm announcing two immediate steps. Firstly, today, my department is publishing a White Paper on corporate transparency and register reform. This White Paper sets out a comprehensive package of reforms to Companies House.

"The agency will be transformed into a custodian of accurate and detailed information ensuring that we can clamp down on those who seek to abuse UK corporate structures to launder money.

"Anyone setting up, running, owning or controlling a company in the UK will need to verify their identity with Companies House, who will then be able to challenge devious information and inform the security agencies."

Mr Kwarteng noted that alongside the White Paper, the Government will be legislating for other measures, "including reform of limited partnerships law, new powers to seize crypto assets and reforms to help businesses share information on suspected money laundering".

Kwasi Kwarteng said the Government will be introducing legislation to Parliament on Tuesday to "accelerate other measures, which will make an immediate, dissuasive effect on dirty money and its purveyors from Russia and elsewhere".

The Business Secretary went on: "The Bill we will introduce tomorrow will create a register of overseas entities to crack down on foreign criminals using UK property to launder their money.

"The new register will require anonymous foreign owners to reveal their real identity to ensure that criminals can no longer hold property behind secretive chains of shell companies.

"By legislating now we will send a clear warning to those who have or who are thinking about using the UK property market to launder ill-gotten gains, particularly those linked to the Putin regime."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, addressing concerns over war crimes, the possible use of chemical weapons and a lack of diplomatic expulsions, said: "We are working very closely with the ICC, the chief prosecutor has already issued a statement about the situation in Ukraine and we're determined that everybody in Russia close to Putin who is in charge of this appalling invasion should be aware that they could be prosecuted for war crimes for what they're doing.

"Of course, on diplomatic expulsions we don't rule anything out and we're working closely with our allies."

On encouraging UK individuals and companies to dispose of investments and shareholdings in Russian companies, Ms Truss told the Commons: "I do welcome the actions by companies who are disassociating themselves from working with the Putin regime, including BP's divestment."

Ofcom has launched 15 investigations into the "due impartiality" of programmes on RT news channel, the broadcast watchdog has announced.

In a statement, Ofcom said it had "observed a significant increase in the number of programmes on the RT service that warrant investigation under our Broadcasting Code".

The investigations relate to 15 editions of the hourly news programme broadcast on RT on February 27 2022 between 5am and 7pm inclusive.

Ofcom said it expected "full co-operation from RT" during its inquiry.

Chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes said: "Given the serious ongoing situation in Ukraine, we will be concluding our investigations into RT as a matter of urgency."

Labour welcomed the Government's plans for an Economic Crime Bill but said the UK had lost time due to years of "Government inaction".

Shadow business minister Seema Malhotra told MPs that Labour supported the measures "in light of the atrocities we are seeing in Ukraine", but added: "He will know that Labour, and indeed some on his own side, have been calling for measures the Government has announced for years.

"We were first promised this legislation in 2016, and in fact it this draft legislation has been ready since 2018. While we support the Government's actions today, he needs to take responsibility for the time and progress lost through Government inaction."

Stressing that "time is of the essence", Ms Malhotra added: "The fact is that the UK would have been in a much stronger position to act with speed and our national security better protected if this register had also been up and running."

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng replied: "Clearly, with respect to the time that it has taken, she will remember that in the 2017-2019 Parliament, a huge amount of our time was taken by members of her party and parties opposite to frustrate Brexit.

"They absorbed a huge amount of Parliamentary time and that was one of the reasons, I am afraid, that we couldn't expedite this sort of legislation."

Funding for enforcement is needed to make sure new measures to crack down on economic crime work properly, ministers have heard.

SNP Treasury spokeswoman Alison Thewliss said: "They can have the finest laws in the land but if there is no action and no investment in enforcement then there is very little point in having them at all."

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng replied that the measures were "only the beginning of a much tighter regime that we want to bring".

Elsewhere in the debate, the Government faced hints that it should make sure its own donations were above board after newspaper reports in recent months of a secretive "advisory board" of wealthy donors to the Conservative Party.

Conservative chair of the intelligence and security committee Julian Lewis said: "I welcome this statement as far as it goes. As a matter of principle, does he agree that cleansing British public life of dirty Russian money is not quintessentially difficult?"

Mr Kwarteng replied: "As he appreciates, this legislation is timely and we are very grateful for the fact that it seems to have elicited a huge amount of support across the House."

Conservative former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell (Sutton Coldfield) said: "Will he at least acknowledge that (some MPs) have been asking the Government to do these things for the last four years and more?

"Will he now look at other measures that we have advocated to clamp down on dirty money and money laundering, and the subject of Companies House, where he is absolutely right, will he now ensure that Companies House has real monkey glands for investigating and is not just a library, and that will need money and officials with great expertise, but sunlight, as ever, is the best disinfectant."

Labour's Dame Margaret Hodge (Barking) said: "The public register of beneficial ownership of properties that are foreign owned was promised when David Cameron was prime minister in 2015.

"It was promised then, nothing to do with Brexit, it could have introduced in that year.

"Then we come to Companies House, I am dismayed that all we're getting is a white paper. We had an extensive consultation which was completed a year ago, which gave plenty of building a consensus around the reforms that are necessary. We don't need a white paper, we need legislation."

DUP MP Sammy Wilson (East Antrim) said: "It's a pity that it's taken a war in Ukraine to bring forward these particular measures.

"There's no mention of what resources are going to be available to ensure that there's checking of whatever information is registered."

He went on: "We have plenty of home-grown people who launder money for criminal activities using their past terrorist connections and that needs to be dealt with as well."

Mr Kwarteng replied: "There is very much a commitment to make sure that we have the resources to police this new regime."

Labour's Liam Byrne (Birmingham, Hodge Hill) said: "This is, at best, a half measure. Companies House has 11,000 shell companies where there is no person of significant control registered, yet there's only been 112 prosecutions, that's just one per cent ... We need a far bigger, bolder plan from the minister today."

Mr Kwarteng replied: "This set of measures will be the biggest reform to Companies House in 200 years, it's something significant."

The Foreign Secretary will attend a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva on Tuesday following the "unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine", the Foreign Office has said.

In a speech to the council, Liz Truss will urge the international community to "isolate Russia and condemn its actions unreservedly", the department said.

The Cabinet minister is expected to say that Russian President Vladimir Putin is "murdering Ukrainians indiscriminately" and that there is "blood on his hands".

"Putin is violating international law, including the UN Charter. He is violating human rights on an industrial scale and the world will not stand for it," she is due to tell the council.

"There are no shades of grey to this conflict. It is about right and wrong. This is Vladimir Putin's unprovoked war against a sovereign nation. There can be no apologising or excusing it.

"I urge nations to condemn Russia's appalling actions and to isolate it on the international stage."

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper urged the Government to provide "clarity" on sanctuary arrangements for Ukraine after, at Home Office questions, Priti Patel confirmed the Ukrainian mother of a British resident would able to join her daughter in the UK.

Ms Cooper claimed that this afternoon the Home Office clarified the arrangements would not cover elderly parents, therefore contradicting the Home Secretary's comments.

Raising a point of order, the shadow home secretary said: "Earlier this afternoon, in response to the Home Secretary's very confusing statement on sanctuary arrangements for Ukraine, I asked the Home Secretary whether the elderly Ukrainian mother of a British resident, who was prevented by Border Force from travelling from Paris to the UK to join her daughter would now, as a result of this announcement, be able today to return to Gare du Nord to come to the UK.

"The Home Secretary said very simply and clearly 'yes', which was welcomed. However, since then, the Home Office has clarified that these arrangements only apply to immediate family - that is spouses, partners, children under 18 and those in need of care. That does not include elderly parents. In this case, the Ukrainian widow is therefore not covered."

Ms Cooper added: "So, given that Home Office ministers are in the House all evening, Mr Deputy Speaker, could you use your endeavours to encourage them to get some clarity for the sake of Ukrainian families?"

Deputy Commons Speaker Nigel Evans replied: "The Government frontbench will have heard the right honourable member's point of order and if the record needs to be corrected, I am sure it will be."

Conservative MP Alicia Kearns (Rutland and Melton) urged the Government to extend transparency efforts into the private education sector.

Speaking in the Commons, she said: "In future packages, will he extend transparency efforts into the private education sector and education corporations, because our sanctions regime should stop these oligarchs who are sanctioned from being able to pay future school fees because they are sanctioned.

"But many of them pay school fees through shell companies, through cash, through cut-outs. And so we make sure that our amazing educational establishments do not continue to receive money of ill-gotten gains."

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng replied: "This has been raised, particularly with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and he is absolutely focused on making sure that our education system isn't abused in the way that property and our companies legislation is."

The Edinburgh International Festival (EIF) said it has asked for and accepted the resignation of Russian conductor Valery Gergiev as its honorary president, with immediate effect.

In a statement, the EIF said: "The board of trustees of the Edinburgh International Festival has asked for, and accepted, the resignation of Valery Gergiev as honorary president of the festival.

"Edinburgh is twinned with the city of Kyiv and this action is being taken in sympathy with, and support of, its citizens."

Mr Gergiev has been dropped by his management company over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

World leaders - including from Poland and Romania, as well as those heading up the G7, Nato and the European Union - agreed to "pursue every avenue to ensure that Putin fails" following the show of Russian military force in Ukraine, No 10 said.

A Downing Street spokeswoman said: "The Prime Minister spoke to G7 and other world leaders this afternoon about the situation in Ukraine.

"The leaders agreed that the valiant resistance to the Russian invasion we are seeing in Ukraine is truly inspirational.

"The Prime Minister stressed the need for countries to continue supporting the Ukrainian government, including with the provision of defensive weapons.

"He also underlined the need for an international response to the emerging humanitarian crisis, including through supporting Ukraine's neighbours to deal with large numbers of Ukrainians escaping violence in the country.

"The Prime Minister welcomed the unity of message and action between countries in recent days in response to Russia's invasion.

"He stressed the need to continue applying pressure on Putin's regime, including on Swift, with sanctions and with trade restrictions. The Prime Minister commended the progress over the weekend with all G7 countries agreeing to remove Russian banks from Swift.

"The Prime Minister also paid tribute to his fellow leaders' renewed commitments to bolster the Nato alliance, including Chancellor Scholz's pledge to massively increase Germany's spending on defence.

"The leaders agreed to pursue every avenue to ensure that Putin fails in his ambitions."

Former One Direction member Louis Tomlinson has cancelled his upcoming concerts in Moscow and Kyiv.

He said in a statement posted on Instagram: "Due to the recent events in Ukraine, I have to sadly announce that my tour shows in Moscow and Kyiv are cancelled until further notice.

"The safety of my fans is my main priority and my thoughts go out to the people of Ukraine and all those suffering from this needless war."

Vladimir Putin has been urged to pull his troops out of Ukraine to prevent further "humanitarian catastrophe" during an address by the UK permanent representative to the United Nations.

Addressing the UN Security Council in New York, Dame Barbara Woodward said: "As a result of President Putin's decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a country of 44 million people is now on the brink of humanitarian catastrophe.

"Whatever my Russian colleague claims, the world can see Russia's indiscriminate attacks against men, women and children across Ukraine, and its disregard for international humanitarian law."

She said missiles had "rained down" on Ukrainian city Kharkiv, that "hundreds of civilians had been killed as a result of the Russian invasion" and seven million people had been displaced, with the figure "rising exponentially".

Dame Barbara said Britain "stands with the Ukrainian people during their time of need" as she outlined the aid pledged by the UK Government.

She concluded: "We know that a humanitarian response is not enough to save the Ukrainian people from the disaster that Russia is inflicting upon them.

"So, our message today is simple. Once again, for the sake of humanity, we call on President Putin to stop this war and withdraw his forces from Ukraine."

The Prime Minister has left London for Warsaw where he is due to meet with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.

Amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Boris Johnson is set to discuss the UK's financial and diplomatic support for central Europe as it faces the prospect of a humanitarian crisis.

Following the meeting he is set to fly to Estonia, where he will meet with leaders in Tallinn before visiting serving troops alongside Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg.

Russian forces have made "little progress" in their advance on Kyiv over the past 24 hours, according to the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

In an intelligence update posted to Twitter on Tuesday morning, MoD stated that this was likely due to "logistical difficulties".

The Department added: "Russian forces have increased their use of artillery north of Kyiv and in vicinities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv.

"The use of heavy artillery in densely populated urban areas greatly increases the risk of civilian casualties.

"Russia has failed to gain control of the airspace over Ukraine prompting a shift to night operations in an attempt to reduce their losses".

Shadow defence secretary John Healey has said despite the "massive bravery" demonstrated by Ukrainians, more civilian casualties are expected in the coming days as a result of the bombs used by Russia on the nation.

Mr Healey told LBC: "It's getting more dangerous. We should expect civilian casualties to rise.

"It may well be that Putin has miscalculated on the determination of the Ukrainian people to fight for their country against this invasion.

"But my fear is, of course, that he has such crushing force and Putin has shown he's utterly ruthless in being willing to use it, that we must fear that the setbacks his military have seen over these first six days may now see some more of his military objectives achieved and we must stand with Ukraine."

Mr Healey called for the UK to provide "whatever further military assistance we can" and "support this resistance" so Mr Putin fails in the long term.

John Healey said Vladimir Putin has "weapons of serious destruction" which he appears to be "directing against civilians" in Ukraine.

Labour's shadow defence secretary told LBC: "He's got massive force and we've started to see some of that moving into Ukraine.

"We can equip the brave Ukrainian people with some of the means to defend themselves, but we've got to see that this is a long run challenge."

He added: "We've got to stand by the Ukrainian people. We've got to offer them political and economic support to their Government, not just military support.

"It's clear that one of Putin's main aims is to destroy the Ukrainian government and if it is forced out of Ukraine, Britain must stand ready to offer it a base in Britain."

Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab warned Vladimir Putin could respond to resistance in Ukraine with "even more barbaric tactics".

He told Sky News: "We know that Putin will react to this, or we fear that he will react to this, with even more barbaric tactics, that's why we must be prepared that this could be a long haul.

The former foreign secretary added: "This is turning into a much, much more perilous misadventure for Putin than I think he realised and it has a demoralised effect on Russia forces and it has had the effect of steeling the will of the Ukrainian people.

"That's how we will ensure Putin fails in Ukraine and we're there for the long haul."

Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has warned Vladimir Putin and his commanders must be held accountable for any war crimes during Moscow's siege on Ukraine.

He told Sky News: "Those that engage in war crimes will be held to account."

He said it must be clear to "both to Putin but also to commanders in Moscow and on the ground in Ukraine that they will be held accountable for any violations of the laws of war".

Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has said the UK will "do everything we practically can" to support Ukraine as the threat towards its capital grows.

Asked whether there is international help to deal with the 40-mile Russian military convoy approaching Kyiv, he told BBC Breakfast: "I'll be careful what I talk about in real time with, of course, the Russians listening but I will assure you we will do everything we practically can to support the Ukrainians.

"Our strategic objective is that Putin fails in this catastrophic misadventure in Ukraine and that the territorial integrity of Ukraine is respected.

"We want to steel the moral, the political but also the military ability of the Ukrainians to resist for as long as possible."

Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has said sanctions against Russia will cause oligarchs to apply pressure on Vladimir Putin and show the cost of war to the Russian people.

After discussing the measures against the Russian central bank, Mr Raab told BBC Breakfast: "That will starve Putin's war machine and will also put pressure on many of the oligarchs who need access to the international system and who will apply pressure on Putin.

"I think it also shows the Russian people at large - and we're certainly not targeting them - but it's inevitable that Russia's and Putin's misadventure, his catastrophic decision, will be disastrous for the Russian people. It will show them the economic cost to them of getting bogged down in this unwarranted, unjustifiable war."

Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has said Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich should denounce Vladimir Putin for his invasion of Ukraine.

Asked if the billionaire could be key to negotiations, Mr Raab told LBC radio: "Who knows? I would say this, first of all, I think the prospect of diplomacy at the moment is slim but we must always make sure that we keep the door to a diplomatic resolution open.

"It's also true to say that the financiers who are close to Putin, the oligarchs and the like, are often one of the most important points of leverage and that's where our sanctions have been directed and targeted."

Asked if Mr Abramovich should denounce the Russian president, Mr Raab said: "I think every right thinking person should denounce what Putin has done."

Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab did not rule out supplying Ukraine with fighter jets to defend itself against Russia.

Mr Raab told LBC radio: "I can't comment on that. We've been clear that we've provided training, we've provided anti-tank weapons and all I would say is nothing is off the table."

Paddy Power and Betfair gambling giant Flutter Entertainment said it had offered to relocate its 80-strong team of staff in Ukraine, but that many were choosing to stay and "defend their country".

The group, which employs contractors and sub-contractors in Ukraine, said it was supporting staff and their families by offering to rehouse them and move them to alternative jobs in neighbouring countries.

Flutter chief executive Peter Jackson said: "I've been in contact with a lot of them - a lot of them are taking up arms and trying to defend their country.

"People aren't leaving Ukraine at the moment."

He added the group was doing "everything we can to support colleagues and their families".

The comments came as Flutter's annual results showed the Russian market contributed £41 million to the group last year, with £19 million from Ukraine.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper has said the Government needs to do more to help Ukrainians fleeing war and seeking to rejoin friends and family in the UK.

She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "At the moment, what the Home Office is doing is trying to just tweak the existing system.

"They're trying to carry on with a version of business as usual, with a version of asking people to apply for traditional work visas or traditional visitor visas or traditional family visas that are still narrowly drawn.

"And the normal system just doesn't work when you are facing war in Europe, when you're facing a crisis on this scale.

"We need to be fast and flexible - that is what other countries have done in different ways and that is what we can do as well, what we have always done in the past, and I think it's what people across the country want to do".

She also said the Home Office "has simply not done the preparation", despite weeks of warnings of a Russian invasion into Ukraine and the resulting refugee crisis.

Shadow defence secretary John Healey has said Ukraine not being a member of Nato does not prevent the UK from aiding the nation during the war.

He told Sky News: "It makes the situation different. We don't have that collective security agreement with Ukraine, but that doesn't stop us doing what we can to help Ukraine defend itself, as we have been doing for a number of years, and step that up in recent weeks.

"Where the UK Government has been willing to act, it's had full Labour support to do that."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has thanked the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for their support amid the Russian invasion.

"Olena and I are grateful to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge that, at this crucial time, when Ukraine is courageously opposing Russia's invasion, they stand by our country and support our brave citizens," he tweeted.

"Good will triumph."

Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could retaliate with increasingly "heavy-handed tactics" if his invasion of Ukraine faces further hitches.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We can expect, for every stutter and stumble, him to try and come back for even more heavy-handed tactics, but that is a sign that the initial phase at least - and this is going to be a long haul - has not lived up to his expectations."

Boris Johnson's flight has arrived at Warsaw Chopin Airport.

The Prime Minister was met by James Hughes, minister-counsellor and acting deputy head of mission at the British Embassy in Poland's capital.

Mr Johnson was then taken by motorcade to meet Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.

Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has continued to rule out the UK enforcing a no-fly zone to aid Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Putting UK forces in the position where they would be directly required to shoot down Russian planes, I agree with the analysis... both in terms with feeding (Vladimir) Putin's narrative, but also from the point of the view of the distinction between what we would do for a Nato ally and the Ukraine, which is a close partner, we want to support, but we will not get involved directly in military operations against Russian forces.

"We have considered a no-fly zone but, for the reasons I've given, the international community as a whole has decided against it."

Shadow defence secretary John Healey urged Britain to support the International Criminal Court prosecutor in his probe into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine.

He told Sky News: "It's going to be very hard in the middle of this war, fighting to gather evidence, protect that evidence and investigate the alleged war crimes.

"So he will also need resources to do that and technical experts to do that, both of which Britain can supply.

"I'd like to see, and Labour would want to see, Dominic Raab and the UK Government throwing their weight behind this as one of the things that we can be doing."

Shadow defence secretary John Healey has said Britons should not travel to Ukraine to join the fighting, following comments by Cabinet minister Liz Truss.

Questioned on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme whether she would support UK citizens who chose to answer the call, the Foreign Secretary said it is "something people can make their own decisions about" and "if people want to support that struggle, I would support them in doing that".

Asked on Sky News on Tuesday whether he agrees with Ms Truss, Mr Healey said: "I think there are better ways for Britain to help the Ukrainians resist this Russian invasion.

"The military support that we're putting in, the economic sanctions to isolate Russia, the support that's now needed for the prosecutor in the International Criminal Court to pursue Russian war crimes, and maintaining and building that Western unity that is going to be required to make sure that, even if (Vladimir) Putin succeeds in the short term with his overwhelming firepower in Ukraine, he fails in the long run."

YouTube has blocked channels linked to Russian state-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik across Europe - including the UK - amid the invasion of Ukraine.

In a statement posted to Twitter, Google Europe said: "Due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we're blocking YouTube channels connected to RT and Sputnik across Europe, effective immediately.

"It'll take time for our systems to fully ramp up. Our teams continue to monitor the situation around the clock to take swift action."

The platform had previously limited the ability of RT and other Russian channels to make money from advertising on the site.

Andrew Duda, Wolverhampton branch chairman of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, said he had "had some phone calls" from people in the UK wanting to travel to fight the Russians in Ukraine, but had referred them to the embassy in London.

He said: "Anybody that does want to fight, we've been told to advise them to contact the Ukrainian embassy in London.

"I'm not sure what the procedure is once people get to the embassy, but that's what we've been told."

Andrew Duda, who has cousins in Lviv in west Ukraine, said of the Russian invasion: "It feels personal - very much so.

"My immediate concern is for the welfare of Ukrainian citizens, and for what our cities will look like after this is over - destroyed, basically," Mr Duda, Wolverhampton branch chairman of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, said.

"They are destroying people's homes, so they'll have nothing to go back to.

"But what I really want is for this military assistance; in weapons and in people who want to fight for Ukraine to go out there.

"I really want to see that happen, so they we can fight off these Russian troops."

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that Vladimir Putin was using "barbaric and indiscriminate tactics against innocent civilians".

The Russian President was prepared to "bomb tower blocks, to send missiles into tower blocks, to kill children, as we are seeing in increasing numbers".

Speaking in Warsaw, Mr Johnson said in the "grim war" Mr Putin had "fatally underestimated" the resistance of the Ukrainians and the resolve of the West to act.

The Prime Minister paid tribute to the "leadership and courage" of Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president.

"I think he has inspired and mobilised not only his own people, he is inspiring and mobilising the world in outrage at what is happening in Ukraine," Mr Johnson added.

Boris Johnson said there was an "unfolding disaster in our European continent".

Speaking in Warsaw the Prime Minister said the Polish government and people were doing an "amazing job, an inspirational job" in addressing the humanitarian crisis.

"We in the UK stand ready to help you, we have humanitarian supplies already coming in - I think two planes of medical supplies have already landed, there is more to come," Mr Johnson said.

The UK Government has come under pressure from Tory and opposition MPs to do more to take in Ukrainian refugees.

Mr Johnson told his Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki: "We stand ready, clearly, to take Ukrainian refugees in our own country, working with you, in considerable numbers, as we always have done and always will."

Ukrainian ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko has warned that Russian invaders could try to starve civilians in major cities in a bid to win the war.

Asked about the possibility by MP Bob Seely, the ambassador told the Commons Foreign Affairs committee that Vladimir Putin was facing a "lack of progress", with civilians meeting his tanks with "molotov cocktails from their cars" rather than the "flowers" he dreamed of.

"The support and resilience is going so much against his plans and in Russia themselves start asking questions 'what are we doing'," the ambassador said.

"I believe they might use the tactics you described in the second part, try to block our cities, try to soften political position, try and maybe ... some riots in Ukraine, because of the lack of food, against the Government."

In a speech in Warsaw, Boris Johnson said Vladimir Putin was "tearing up every principle of civilised behaviour between states".

"He has hurled his war machine on the people of Ukraine, a fellow Slavic country, he has bombarded civilian targets, fired rockets at blocks of flats, he is responsible for hundreds of civilian casualties including growing numbers of children.

"And also, of course, for the deaths of many Russian and Ukrainian soldiers.

"We must accept the grim reality that Putin will continue to tighten the vice and, if you go by the size and firepower of Vladimir Putin's war machine, the odds have always been heavily against Ukrainian armed forces."

In a speech in Warsaw, Boris Johnson said Vladimir Putin had made a "colossal mistake" by invading Ukraine.

"Putin has lied to his people and to his troops about how this conflict would go, and he has now been caught out in that lie," he said.

"They have not been welcomed to Ukraine as he prophesised, their tanks have not been cheered in the streets or garlanded with flowers.

"Instead, Ukrainians have mounted an astonishing and tenacious resistance."

Boris Johnson said more would be done to allow Ukrainians to come to the UK, with around 200,000 eligible under an expanded route for people to bring family members in.

Speaking in Warsaw, he said: "What we are going to do is we are extending the family scheme so that actually very considerable numbers would be eligible ... you could be talking about a couple of hundred thousand, maybe more.

"Additionally, we are going to have a humanitarian scheme and then a scheme by which UK companies and citizens can sponsor individual Ukrainians to come to the UK."

Boris Johnson said evidence of Vladimir Putin's attacks on civilians could be used in a future trial at The Hague.

Speaking in Warsaw, Mr Johnson said: "There's no doubt that he is already using barbaric tactics, bombing civilian areas.

"I have seen the reports about cluster bombs and thermobaric weapons, they will, of course, have to be verified.

"I think that everybody involved in the Russian onslaught should understand that all this will be collated in evidence to be used at a future time in what could be proceedings before the International Criminal Court."

Boris Johnson suggested ways in which sanctions on Vladimir Putin's regime could be tightened.

The Prime Minister said: "There is plainly more to be done on Swift, we can tighten up yet further on Swift, even though it has had a dramatic effect already I think we do need to go further.

"There's more to be done on Sberbank, there's more to be done on the freezing of Russian assets.

"I think there's genuine amazement and dismay in Russia about what has happened already but there is more to be done."

There could be more "severing of sporting links" and "cracking down on the billionaires associated with Vladimir Putin".

Boris Johnson was confronted by a Ukrainian woman who emotionally demanded Britain and Nato allies enforce a no-fly zone to protect citizens from Russia's bombs.

Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre civil society organisation, told the Prime Minister at a press conference in Warsaw she is from Kyiv but passed through the border in recent days.

"Ukrainian women and Ukrainian children are in deep fear because of bombs and missiles which are going from the sky. Ukrainian people are desperately asking for the rights to protect our sky, we are asking for a no-fly zone.

"What's the alternative for the no-fly zone?

"Nato is not willing to defend because Nato is afraid of World War Three but it's already started and it's Ukrainian children who are there taking the hit.

"You are talking about more sanctions Prime Minister but Roman Abramovich is not sanctioned, he's in London, his children are not in the bombardments, his children are there in London."

Boris Johnson was asked how he felt as a father when he saw the images of dying Ukrainian children.

The Prime Minister said: "I think I felt what everybody in the world felt looking at that, that this is absolutely senseless.

"I think Vladimir Putin is father himself, and no one can possibly understand how he has unleashed this conflict which seems to everybody to be so futile.

"Everybody can see that the Ukrainians are resisting."

Mr Putin "cannot now succeed, I think he needs to reconcile himself to that fact rather than endlessly doubling down on violence", Mr Johnson added.

A Ukrainian journalist made an emotional appeal to Boris Johnson to impose a no-fly zone to protect civilians in the country.

The Prime Minister said: "I'm acutely conscious that there is not enough that we can do, as the UK Government, to help in the way that you want and I've got to be honest about that.

"When you talk about the no-fly zone, as I said to (Ukrainian President) Volodymyr Zelensky a couple of times, unfortunately the implication of that is the UK would be engaged in shooting down Russian planes, it would be engaged in direct combat with Russia.

"That's not something that we can do or that we've envisaged. The consequences of that would be truly very, very difficult to control."

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the UK has become the first country to pass a law banning ships with "any Russian connection" from entering its ports.

He wrote on Twitter: "At London's Foreign Office where we've just become the first nation to pass a law involving a total BAN of ALL ships with ANY Russian connection whatsoever from entering British ports.

"Please RT to encourage all countries to do the same in support of the people of £Ukraine."

The NHS is encouraging hospitals to shore up cyber security and examining its supply chain resilience in the wake of the situation in Ukraine, the head of the service in England has said.

Asked about the conflict, Amanda Pritchard told the Nuffield Trust Summit Series event: "What does it mean for us? The first thing is support for our staff who are from the Ukraine but I'm also talking about wider support for all of our staff including anybody from Eastern Europe or Russia.

"We have had an outpouring of support locally for people whose families might be affected by this or who are worried themselves... so the more that we can do to provide both practical and emotional support for staff who are affected by this, that's got to be top of mind.

"The second thing (is cyber) - we have written out to the NHS, a lot of it is just a good practice about what what you should be doing around cybersecurity, but again, this just kind of brings it to the forefront.

"And I think for those organisations, who are still just working through some patching and other things, just encouraging people to make that the focus at the moment.

Amanda Pritchard said NHS England was also monitoring the supply chain, including energy supplies.

"The third thing, is about our supply chain resilience. So we're doing some work nationally looking at supply chain resilience - energy resilience is clearly kind of part of that."

She added: "Part of what we have been doing is looking at things like whether we have got any sort of flexibility around supplies, which we can make sure that made available to be provided over to the Ukraine, particularly medical supplies that can be used to for casualties.

"That's something that is being done by Government, so (we are) playing a role in that and that as well."

(corrected repetition, amending heat to hit in second par. First ran at 1142)

Speaking after she made her emotional plea to Boris Johnson to enforce a no-fly zone, Daria Kaleniuk told reporters: "My message is that the suffering of people in Ukraine is unbelievable now."

"My call to the West is protect our sky. It is insane that our sky is being protected by children who are taking the hit," she said.

She said Ukrainians were "taking guns with zero protection" to "fight the evil" of Russian troops.

Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said there is "indisputable evidence" of Russian war crimes in Ukraine.

"We've seen I think indisputable evidence now that war crimes are taking place in Ukraine - the brutalising of a number of Ukrainian cities, the deliberate targeting of civilians," he told reporters in Dublin.

"First of all, it is now under investigation from the International Criminal Court, who have now opened a file on potential war crimes in Ukraine, and I think that says a lot.

"But I think we can see for ourselves in terms of some of the social media pictures that are coming out, which I think are being stood over by the media organisations, as to the extent of civilian targeting in Ukrainian cities, which is essentially terrorising civilian populations.

"And that is something that can't go unchecked and we need to call it out."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has warned "nothing and no one is off the table" as Britain and allies hit Russia with sanctions over Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

She told the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva: "Putin is responsible for civilian casualties and over 500,000 people fleeing with the numbers still rising fast. The blood is on Putin's hands, not just of innocent Ukrainians but the men he has sent to die.

"We're using our collective heft, making up over half the world's economy to cut funding from Putin's war machine and we're delivering severe economic costs through these sanctions as ordinary Russians are finding form queues at their local banks and rising interest rates.

"These consequences will only increase in breadth and severity as the conflict goes on, we're working to squeeze the Putin regime harder and harder by steadily tightening the vice.

"We're going after the highest echelons of the Russian elite, targeting President Putin personally and all of those complicit in his aggression. Nothing and no one is off the table."

Simon Coveney said the three rounds of EU sanctions against Russia, along with the arms and non-lethal supplies sent to Ukraine, was evidence of the bloc working at "unprecedented pace" to respond to the invasion.

"I think we have no choice but to show a level of resolve and solidarity within the European Union that is proportionate to what is happening on our doorstep in the heart of Europe," he said.

"We have a sovereign state, a democracy, being brutalised and attacked by one of the most powerful military forces on the planet and we have got to respond to that.

"I've been in politics for nearly 25 years and I've never seen an issue that has galvanised European unity in a way that this has. It's changing countries' foreign policy, it's bringing countries together in a way that sets differences aside.

"So many countries across the European Union have different and complex relationships with Russia historically but this issue really has I think brought people together rather than anything else, and it will continue to in the days ahead."

A British man with no army or conflict experience has said he is signing up to fight alongside Ukrainians in "solidarity".

Roger Conway, 34, from Newcastle, went to the Ukrainian Embassy, where he collected an email address to volunteer his services, that he immediately wrote.

Speaking to the PA news agency near the embassy in West London, he said: "We've convinced ourselves that we're stepping in and we're helping by having Facebook photos and tweeting solidarity but it doesn't really make a difference to anyone.

"Solidarity doesn't look real if you don't do anything".

Mr Conway, who works as a contractor in finance, said he had never been in the army.

"I've never been in but I've not got kids, I'm 34, feel fit".

Asked if he was scared, he said: "Possibly a little but that's no reason not to do anything in life. I'm ready, I think".

Downing Street set out further details on the extended scheme for Ukrainian family members of people living in the UK to come to the country.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said people living in the UK would now be allowed to bring in "adult parents, grandparents, children over 18 and siblings" in addition to the immediate family members which had previously been allowed.

Home Secretary Priti Patel will set out further details in the Commons later.

Simon Coveney said the number of Ukrainian refugees expected in Ireland may need Irish families to open up their homes to provide temporary accommodation.

Mr Coveney said the conflict was the first war that has "played out on social media".

"I think as Irish people watch what's happening to Ukrainians and they're horrified by it and they want us to be working with our EU partners and indeed other partners to respond to that in solidarity.

"And we are. So we know we've already announced a 10 million-euro humanitarian package. I expect we'll do a lot more than that. We've waived any requirements for visas for Ukrainians to come into Ireland, and they're going to get effectively a special refugee status when they get here for up to three years to be able to work and live here, effectively as EU citizens.

"I think, in truth, if we're going to be able to accommodate the numbers that I expect to come here, we're going to have to go beyond providing state provided accommodation.

"It will probably have to involve families as well who are willing to open up their homes to Ukrainian families for a temporary period of time. But this is a war effort, so the norms need to get set aside."

Previously it had been expected that around 100,000 Ukrainians would be eligible to come to the UK, but that has now risen to 200,000 under the widened scheme.

But Downing Street acknowledged those numbers were "indicative only" as it was "impossible to predict" how many would want to come, rather than stay in countries closer to Ukraine.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "We think it is right to have that open offer so that they can bring loved ones and be reunited with them should they wish to make that journey."

Boris Johnson also set out plans for a scheme allowing organisations and individuals to sponsor Ukrainians to come to the UK.

The Prime Minister's spokesman said the Government would work with the UN refugee agency to identify people on the border and also liaise with councils, the devolved administrations and individuals and organisations who want to be involved.

Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the EU would suffer as a result of the sanctions against Russia.

"The extent of the sanctions that are now in place or being put in place are extraordinary measures that mean that the EU is going to suffer as a result of these sanctions, as well as Russia," he said.

"But I think that's a sacrifice that the EU is willing to make.

"But I think the humanitarian response that Ireland will need to be central to and part of, I think will also demand a level of solidarity and support and generosity and emotional connection with a country that's just being torn apart at the moment."

Boris Johnson has paid tribute to the bravery of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

In a speech at the British Embassy in Warsaw, the Prime Minister said he had spoken to Mr Zelensky "almost every day", adding: "When I think of the dangers and the pressures, the physical dangers that he must be facing, I marvel at his coolness under fire, his bravery, his invincible good humour.

"I think he is mobilising the world against the horror of what is happening."

Mr Johnson said: "Putin's war machine will not succeed in holding down Ukraine."

"And so the best thing for Russia and Ukraine and for the world is for this misbegotten venture to be halted and reversed as fast as possible," he added.

Vehicle manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover has suspended sales to Russia.

The firm said: "Jaguar Land Rover's first priority is the wellbeing of our entire workforce and their families, as well as those within our extended network.

"The current global context also presents us with trading challenges so we are pausing the delivery of vehicles into the Russian market and continually monitoring the situation on behalf of our global customer base."

The Prime Minister said that if Vladimir Putin is allowed to win he will "overthrow the post-Cold War order and destroy the vision of a Europe whole and free".

Boris Johnson, in a speech at the British Embassy in Warsaw, said if Mr Putin was not challenged "the outcome will be a world where aggression is triumph, where might is right, and extreme violence pays off, and no nation would be safe".

A father from Dartford is volunteering to travel to Ukraine to help people in a humanitarian capacity because "it's the right thing to do".

Liam Hawkins, 30, told reporters outside the Ukrainian Embassy in London: "I haven't slept since this invasion and I just can't stay at home with my babies and my missus and do nothing.

"Right is right and wrong is wrong, regardless of nationality or creed or whatever.

"I've got a good life here in England, I've got a good job, I make plenty of money.

"Sit there and count your money when this is going on next door? Doesn't mean nothing, so I'm going to do the right thing.

"I know it's dangerous; people are trying to talk me out of it, but I believe I can make a difference".

Boris Johnson said sanctions imposed on the Kremlin should not be seen as hostility towards the Russian people.

In his speech, the PM said: "I must emphasise that we are not motivated by any hostility towards Russia or the Russians. Quite the reverse.

"All our hearts ache for the Russian soldiers sent to die in this futile venture, we all grieve with their parents."

He added: "No wonder the Kremlin-controlled media refuses to tell the Russian people that their soldiers are attacking Kyiv. No wonder they spin a tissue of lies and claim that Russia is merely conducting a special operation in the Donbas.

"Russia is a great country and civilisation and we will never forget her sacrifice in the struggle against fascism side-by-side with ourselves.

"We must emphasise every day that it is Putin's regime which is exacting from its own people an unacceptable cost for an unnecessary war, a war of choice that should end as soon as possible."

The Prime Minister said the West needed "patience and resolve" to weather what would be a "prolonged crisis".

In a speech at the British Embassy in Warsaw, Boris Johnson said: "However long it takes, a sovereign and independent Ukraine will emerge once again, because Putin has stubbed his toe and tripped on a giant and immovable fact, which is no matter how many troops and tanks he sends, the Ukrainians' desire to live in a free and independent country."

He said the UK would support Ukraine's "unquenchable and manifest will to resist", and he added: "And in the face of this gathering tragedy, I say to Vladimir Putin and his regime there is only one way out of this morass.

"And that is to stop the tanks, to turn back the tanks on their way to Kyiv, turn them round and take the path to peace.

Tens of thousands of medical items have been sent by the UK in response to the "humanitarian emergency" in Ukraine caused by Russia's invasion, the Health Secretary has said.

Sajid Javid told MPs: "I share the horror and disgust of almost everyone within this House, this country and the whole world at the unprovoked, unjust and unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine by President Putin last week.

"This appalling act has created a humanitarian emergency and we're looking at every opportunity to give the people of Ukraine the support they so urgently need.

"On Sunday night we sent almost 50,000 items of medical supplies to Poland via air for onward transport to Ukraine.

"And I can inform the House that another plane departed at 7am this morning with more supplies, including medical equipment and PPE (personal protective equipment).

"We have all been in awe of the bravery and the heroism shown by the Ukrainian people and rest assured we all stand with them, shoulder-to-shoulder, in their hour of need."

There was a mass walkout from the UN Human Rights Council as Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov spoke.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said his statement was "full of disinformation" and did not deserve the attention of other members.

"Russia is isolated and should be ashamed to sit in the UN chamber," she said.

The UK cannot waive visas for people fleeing from Ukraine as it must protect national security, the Home Secretary has said.

Priti Patel responded to calls for visa waivers by telling MPs that "Russian troops are seeking to infiltrate and merge with Ukrainian forces" and that there are "extremists on the ground" in Ukraine.

The Home Secretary added: "Given this and also Putin's willingness to do violence on British soil, and in keeping with our approach which we have retained consistently throughout all emergency evacuations including in Afghanistan, we cannot suspend any security or biometric checks on people we welcome to our country.

"We have collective duty to keep the British people safe and this approach is based on the strongest security advice."

Boris Johnson has arrived in Estonia for the second leg of his European trip.

The Prime Minister's flight landed in Tallinn before he set off for the border to meet with British troops on the frontline of Russian aggression, where he will be joined by Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg.

He will also meet Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas and President Alar Karis to discuss European security and stability.

Priti Patel, on the Ukrainian family scheme, said: "British nationals and people settled in the Ukraine can bring a wider group of family members to the UK, extending eligibility to parents, grandparents, adult offspring, siblings and their immediate family members; again the scheme will be free.

"Those joining family in the UK will be granted leave for an initial period of 12 months. They will be able to work and access public funds.

"Secondly, we will establish a humanitarian sponsorship pathway which will open up a route to the UK for Ukrainians who may not have family ties with the UK, but who are able to match with individuals, charities, businesses and community groups.

"Those who come under this scheme will also be granted leave for an initial period of 12 months and they will be able to work and have access to public services.

"The Home Office will work closely with all our international partners on the ground to ensure that displaced Ukrainians that are in need of a home are supported. The Secretary of State for Levelling Up (Michael Gove) will work with the devolved administrations to ensure that those who want to sponsor an individual or family can volunteer and be matched quickly with Ukrainians in need.

"There will be no numerical limit on this scheme and we'll welcome as many Ukrainians that wish to come and have match sponsors."

Priti Patel told the Commons that the case of an elderly Ukrainian national, stuck in Paris after trying to cross to the UK to be with her British-resident relatives, had now been solved.

The Home Secretary said: "The member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper) raised a specific case yesterday and I am pleased to confirm the person concerned has been able to travel to the UK."

Ms Patel also clarified the rules for the Ukrainian families of British nationals fleeing for safety, telling MPs: "Where family members of British nationals do no meet the usual eligibility criteria but do pass all the security checks, we will give them permission to enter the UK outside the usual rules for 12 months.

"This means that British nationals and any persons settled in the UK can bring over immediate Ukrainian family members.

"Through this policy alone, an additional 100,000 Ukrainians could be eligible to come to the UK and access work and public services.

"There is no limit on the numbers eligible under this route."

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and deputy leader Angela Rayner have arrived at the Ukrainian Orthodox Autocephalic Church in west London.

The pair are here for a special service of hope and prayer for the people of Ukraine.

It is a ecumenical service, meaning there are several different denominations of Christianity being represented by faith leaders.

They were greeted by Bishop Kenneth Nowakowski on arrival before laying flowers at a memorial in the church grounds.

The pair held a minute's silence before bowing to the memorial. They will now be attending a service at the church.

Inside a service for the Ukrainian people at a church in west London, Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner broke bread before lighting candles at the altar.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, on the changes to widen access for Ukrainian refugees seeking to reach the UK, told the Commons: "There will be considerable relief that the Government has now changed its position and now accepted we must do more.

"And in particular I'm glad the Government appears to have completely changed its policy in response to our calls to help elderly parents and wider family members, and I'm glad they have listened not just to those in this House but across the country and, most importantly of all, to Ukrainians and their families."

Ms Cooper asked several questions in a bid to establish how many people the changes will help, and sought assurances that nobody will have to pay if they are seeking sanctuary from Ukraine.

She added: "Does the sponsoring family member have to be British or have to have indefinite leave to remain? What about Ukrainians here on work visas, on study visas, who have come maybe as lorry drivers or on visitor visas?

"Surely she is not expecting to turn their families away? When people are fleeing Russian authoritarianism and war, I assume she will not be applying a test based on which bureaucratic box UK residents tick?

"Can she make a simple commitment now that family members from Ukraine who are fleeing persecution are all welcome here in the UK - no matter what visa their family member here in the UK has, that we will give them sanctuary?"

Home Secretary Priti Patel said: "I think it's important to recognise that the British Government is the first government to actually outline some practical measures in terms of how we are bringing people to the UK."

She added: "It is a family scheme, on that basis, a Ukrainian family scheme, so family members - and I've already outlined some of the categories - will be eligible to come over to the UK and the scheme will be free.

"She's also mentioned about the lady that has paid fees, all fees for schemes will not be put in place. If there's a refund that needs to be provided, that will also be provided."

Ms Patel said as of tomorrow there would be a Home Office team based in Portcullis House "where MPs can directly refer cases".

She said: "We have a very generous offer in terms of the numbers of people that we would like to bring over... We are not bringing in caps or limits to these numbers at all. At this stage I think we should just be very honest and level with everyone, we do not know the numbers of people that would seek to come to the UK."

Boris Johnson was met off his flight in Tallinn by British ambassador to Estonia Ross Allen.

He was also greeted by defence attache Commander Rob Steadman and Sirje Sepaste from the protocol department of the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, before setting off to the army base.

The Ukrainian community in Halifax, West Yorkshire, praised the "incredible" response to a plea for essential items for those fleeing the country, saying the reaction to the crisis is "almost like Live Aid".

Ivan Kuzio, 60, who is helping co-ordinate, said enough has already been massed at a collection point at a farm in the town to fill one lorry, which they hope will be heading for the Poland/Ukraine border later this week.

Mr Kuzio said the plan is to fill a container a week with essential supplies as well as drive smaller vehicles into western Ukraine with military grade first aid supplies.

He told the PA news agency: "The word is going out. People are recognising the bravery of the Ukrainians.

"This response has been incredible. It's almost like Live Aid. Everyone wants to get involved."

Labour MP Chris Bryant warned the Government is "taking too long" to bring sanctions, and suggested Roman Abramovich is "terrified" of facing such measures.

The MP for Rhondda said the Government has "quite rightly" said that it wants to sanction Duma members, and it wants to sanction members of the Russian Federation Council "but it's not been able to do so yet".

He said: "Alisher Usmanov has already been sanctioned by the EU but not yet by the UK, but I suspect he will be pretty soon on a UK list. And Everton should certainly be cutting ties with him already.

"Roman Abramovich, well, I think he's terrified of being sanctioned, which is why he's already going to sell his home tomorrow, and sell another flat as well. My anxiety is that we are taking too long about these things."

He said he fears the Government is "frightened of lawyers' letters from all these oligarchs' friends". He suggested ministers read into the record in a proceeding in Parliament all the sanction criteria to provide protection.

Home Secretary Priti Patel said: "His points are absolutely valid. It is taking time, and there are lots of legal reasons and he will be aware of that, and members of the House will know this as well.

"I don't want to cut across the work that the FCDO are doing on this right now, but there is a lot of detailed work taking place on sanctions, and much of that is coming to the House pretty soon."

There is a "big effort" to move the Nationality and Borders Bill through the House of Lords quickly so measures to process refugees such as those fleeing Ukraine can become law, Home Secretary Priti Patel said.

Conservative MP Sir William Cash (Stone) said: "She has enormous problems to deal with and I am sure the whole of the House will be united in supporting her and the Prime Minister and the Government in this national emergency.

"Could she do everything possible to ensure that the legislation currently in the House of Lords which is indicated will need to be amended will be implemented and enacted as soon as possible and could I urge her to urge the House of Lords to take the measures necessary to get this legislation on to the statute book as soon as possible?"

Ms Patel replied: "Operationalising legislation is not straightforward. We are working on plans to do that which is why there is a big effort to ask our colleagues in the Lords to bring back the legislation here so we can get it done."

Home Secretary Priti Patel said: "The work of our Government is actually twofold, it is to provide the support in the region, the humanitarian assistance, because there is a big need for humanitarian support and aid and the Government is doing that, while at the same time creating routes."

On resettlement, she said: "We've created resettlement pathways, this Government has that capability and we are absolutely ready to stand them up."

Conservative Sir Roger Gale (North Thanet) said: "Can we do please as we did in 1956 and 1968, cut through the red tape and get these people home so that their menfolk fighting and dying on the streets of Kyiv can at least know that their women and their children are safe."

SNP home affairs spokesman Stuart McDonald said: "Why is it that yet again at a time of humanitarian crisis, the Home Office is having to be dragged towards a generous and comprehensive response instead of a shambolic and miserly mess.

"For days the Home Secretary has lagged behind the demands of the public, demands from this Parliament and even within her own party. For Ukrainians already here, instead of a piecemeal visa extension, can we have a comprehensive extension of all visas for at least a year... Will the department stop with this PR exercise, picking numbers out of a hat, to justify its miserly response. 100,000, 200,000, these are completely and utterly works of fiction designed to get the Home Office out of a hole."

Ms Patel replied: "I have to say, I find (his) comments quite offensive actually."

Conservative former minister David Davis welcomed the Home Secretary's response "to the calls for generosity from many of us as I expected she would", adding "I think this is a much more generous system" and "quite properly she's taken time to make it work practically".

He said under some forecasts, the number of refugees who will flee Ukraine could see the UK's "burden of sharing that would probably be about half a million people".

Mr Davis said a "significant number of these, maybe a majority will be women and children" and said the burdens on housing, education and social support "would be bigger than anything we've seen before".

He asked about steps being taken to ensure the "burden is shared across the whole of the continent", saying that is the "only way to look after these people properly".

Home Secretary Priti Patel said she is in touch with the EU on a "frequent basis", saying: "Even yesterday, I appreciate everybody's said the EU has moved quickly, but actually they have made an announcement and they are still discussing how in practical terms they can establish temporary protection measures and how they can activate their schemes."

"We all have to step up," she said, adding that informal talks with devolved administrations have taken place and that the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities will be "playing a pivotal role".

Biometric checks for people fleeing to the UK from Ukraine must be kept to avoid another Salisbury poisoning, a Conservative former minister has warned.

Conservative former chief whip Mark Harper said: "Could I just gently say to SNP members it is really important that we continue to keep the biometric checks in place.

"I can still remember what happened in Salisbury. The Putin regime is a regime that will not hesitate to send agents here to kill British citizens and it is the Home Secretary's job to make sure we keep people safe."

SNP home affairs spokesman Stuart C McDonald had earlier said that a visa waiver for all Ukrainians fleeing to the UK was "the simple and just response" to the crisis.

Home Secretary Priti Patel said there are lessons being learned from other schemes such as for people fleeing Afghanistan and Syria.

She said: "There are lessons that we are learning as well off the back of previous schemes, the Syrian resettlement scheme and also the Afghanistan scheme as well where there is still so much work to do.

"And it does come back to (Conservative MP David Davis's) point about accommodation and infrastructure in our own country, which we have to be very honest about in terms of how we can actually support people that we do bring over."

Ms Patel added: "The best thing that the British people can do is give a warm welcome to people from Ukraine who are coming here."

Former Cabinet minister Dame Andrea Leadsom welcomed the "compassionate and balanced response" of the measures outlined, and the chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee, Labour MP Dame Diana Johnson thanked the Home Secretary for the statement "after the confusion of yesterday's attempt".

Labour MP Hilary Benn (Leeds Central) said he is aware of two mothers and three children who have now reached Poland. One mother and one child, who are his constituents, have pre-settled status and British citizenship respectively, and he asked if the woman's Ukrainian sister and two children could come to the UK under the plans. Ms Patel said they could.

Conservative former minister Sir Edward Leigh congratulated the Home Secretary for her "proportionate response", as the United Kingdom is "the country of choice for mass migration".

Speaking in the Commons, the MP for Gainsborough said: "May I actually congratulate her on her proportionate response. I think we have to remember that unlike the rest of Europe we have uniquely liberal labour laws and we speak English so we are the country of choice for mass immigration.

"And therefore I do urge her to as well as listen to all these humanitarian voices, to listen to the voices of people from for instance in Lincolnshire, where we feel we have done really our bit in terms of migration from eastern Europe where we are under extreme pressure in terms of housing and jobs.

"I know it is difficult to say but we have to be honest about this - and may I therefore be a correcting voice in this and congratulate her on her humanitarian but proportionate response and not throwing away the immigration rule book?"

Priti Patel replied: "We want to do the right thing by the people of Ukraine. There is no question about that.

"I have spoken about security checks, the significance of them but also the fact that we are giving people who want to come to the United Kingdom the chance to live their lives freely, access public funds but also work and with that of course, people will need documentation and we have a system in place for all that."

Conservative MP Peter Bone pressed the Home Secretary on the creation of a "no-fly safe zone" in western Ukraine for refugees.

The MP for Wellingborough said: "As we know, women and children are fleeing through west Ukraine to get to safe countries but they are vulnerable obviously to air attack by Russian aircraft.

"Has there been any discussion to create a no-fly safe zone in western Ukraine for refugees? And did the Home Secretary discuss this when she spoke to the Ukrainian ambassador?"

Priti Patel replied: "We discuss all issues. Some of which I can't actually share on the floor of this House because some are very sensitive no matter what is going on with the attack.

"There are discussions taking place constantly but he's right to highlight just how dangerous, volatile and precarious the situation is. And we are all mindful of that as we work with our counterparts and our colleagues."

Estonia's Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said Russia had gone from being a "difficult neighbour to a rogue state".

At a joint press conference with Boris Johnson and Nato's Jens Stoltenberg, she also said Belarusian troops were also part of the invasion force in Ukraine.

"There's no doubt Belarus is a co-aggressor in this conflict," she said.

Sir Keir Starmer has been urged by Ukrainian parishioners to lobby the Government to implement a no-fly zone above Ukraine.

Speaking to members of the congregation after a service, Andriy Petryk, a cab driver, asked the Labour leader to speak to the Government following Russian bombing of Ukraine.

He told Sir Keir: "I know it's too much to ask, with the no-fly zone. Two weeks ago, most of the country was against switching Russia off from Swift.

"Opinions change on an hourly and daily basis. I think you might reconsider. Would you like to ask (the Government) to implement a no-fly zone?"

Sir Keir said: "We'll talk to the Government about that."

Speaking at the Tapa military base in Estonia, Boris Johnson said: "It's clearer, day by day, from the way the Ukrainians are responding, that President Putin has made a disastrous miscalculation."

Russian troops have not been welcomed into Ukraine but instead have faced "astonishing and tenacious resistance", the Prime Minister said.

"We as the international community have a responsibility to do everything we can to help the Ukrainians in their efforts," he said.

"That is why the UK has trained 22,000 members of the Ukrainian armed forces and why we have provided further defensive military support to Ukraine."

Boris Johnson said the UK and allies had put in place "the biggest package of sanctions ever imposed against a G20 nation".

"We have seen organisations from banks to oil companies to football leagues to singing competitions who have made it clear that Vladimir Putin and his regime must be isolated from the international community for his actions," he said at the Tapa military base in Estonia.

Members of a congregation questioned Sir Keir Starmer over potential "security threats" from Russian oligarchs and their influence.

One asked the Labour leader: "What about the security threat coming from the oligarchs and that they're still here?"

She urged for them to be discussed in a "meaningful way" by Parliament, to which Sir Keir said "yes, yes they will".

He added later on: "What Putin wants is Ukraine to be left on its own, for the allies to be divided, for Nato to be divided up, for us to be divided in the United Kingdom. We're not going to allow that to happen, that's why we're standing with the Government on this.

"But I absolutely get you pushing us to say, look, we've got to go further. We've got to go further. And we've got the debate today, Prime Minister's Questions tomorrow... so we'll continue those discussions. That's the formal part of Parliament in the chamber but there's also legal discussions that go on behind the scenes in terms of the cross-party discussions going on.

"So I hear what you're saying and we'll take that away and feed that into discussions that we're having."

Boris Johnson clarified that Britain is not actively supporting UK volunteers going to join the fight against Russia in Ukraine.

An Estonian journalist asked Mr Johnson about what she suggested was the Government supporting volunteers joining the fight, to which the Prime Minister replied: "I'm going to be very clear about this because you're not quite right in what you say about supporting volunteers going to fight, the UK is not actively doing such a thing.

"But I understand of course the feelings of people who feel emotionally engaged in this conflict because I cannot think of a time in international affairs when the difference between right and wrong, between good and evil, has been so obvious.

"I can understand why people feel as they do but we have laws in our country about international conflicts and how they must be conducted.

"Nato is a defensive alliance. I think for any Nato member to get involved actively in conflict with Russia is a huge step which is not being contemplated by any member."

Conservative former immigration minister Caroline Nokes urged that the family scheme "works at pace".

She said: "Can I be reassured that the Home Secretary will make sure that this scheme works at pace though because that's one of the biggest lessons that we've had to learn, we need this to work quickly. People are being bombed as they try to flee Ukraine.

"We often hear the language of burden sharing, when we're talking about refugees it's not a burden, we should regard it as a privilege to be in a position to help."

Priti Patel replied: "It is an absolute privilege in terms of not just how we stand up in the world, but actually the support that we give to other human beings."

Boris Johnson said the scenes in Kharkiv were "absolutely sickening" and compared the situation to some of the attacks on Sarajevo in the Bosnian war.

"It has that feel to me of an atrocity committed deliberately against a civilian centre," he said at Tapa military base in Estonia.

Again ruling out a no-fly zone over Ukraine, Mr Johnson said: "It's very, very important to understand Nato is a defensive alliance. This is a time when miscalculation and misunderstanding is all too possible and it's therefore crucial that we get that message over.

"When it comes to a no-fly zone in the skies above Ukraine we have to accept the reality that that involves shooting down Russian planes ... that's a very, very big step, it's simply not on the agenda of any Nato country."

Boris Johnson played down the prospect of Russia being thrown off the UN Security Council because the rules could not be changed without Moscow's agreement due to its veto.

But he added: "What is happening is that the great middle of the UN congregation is starting to realise quite how horrific this is.

"With every day that goes by, as they watch the heroism of the Ukrainian resistance and they see what's happening in Ukraine and they see episodes like the missile in Kharkiv and the destruction of civilian populations, I think people's stomachs are being turned by what is happening.

"They are seeing that it is necessary to stand up against Russian aggression, to support the Ukrainians and to endorse our strategy which is that President Putin must not be allowed to succeed, he must fail in Ukraine."

Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the column of "heavy Russian armour" moving towards Kyiv would bring "more death, more suffering and more civilian casualties".

Speaking at the Tapa military base in Estonia, he said: "That is the reason why we need to continue to provide support to Ukraine, why we continue to call on Russia to stop this bloody war and why we need to impose costs by the heavy sanctions on Russia."

Mr Stoltenberg added that the situation was "horrifying" and "a blatant violation of international law".

Speaking to journalists after a service in west London, which was held to offer prayers for the Ukrainians, Sir Keir Starmer said: "I think it's very important we stand united. Putin wants our allies to be divided.

"He wants Nato to be divided and he wants to see division here in the United Kingdom.

"It's very important that we stand together, here with the community, the Ukrainian people, they've been expressing their concern about what's happening in their country and urging us to go further in the support we can get them."

Outlining his response to the Home Secretary's announcement over visa plans for Ukrainians, Sir Keir Starmer told journalists: "I think we need to go further in our support for Ukraine.

"First and foremost, what the people of Ukraine, those in Ukraine, want is our support to help them in defending their cities and defending their country. So that's the first level of support that we need.

"Of course, we need to ramp up even more the economic sanctions and there's a frustration that whilst we'll vote with the Government on sanctions, we want them to go further, we want them to go faster.

"And of course, on the humanitarian front, we're seeing people fleeing, we must do as we've historically done, which is to give them the support that they need. A simple route to sanctuary is what we're seeking.

"I don't think the Home Office and Home Secretary have gone far enough on this, but it's all those three levels of support that are absolutely crucial at the moment."

Sir Keir Starmer said the UK "must supply the equipment and the support that we can" to the Ukrainian people and "double down on sanctions".

"We need not to just isolate Russia, but to make it impossible for Russia to function through the sanctions that we put in," the Labour leader told journalists.

"And of course the humanitarian aid, which is so important and the community here have been reminding me historically how important that aspect is as well."

Prior to Sir Keir Starmer's visit to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in west London, he attended a Ministry of Defence briefing.

Questioned about whether he was worried about what he heard, he told journalists: "Well, I'm not going to disclose what we were told in the briefing.

"The situation is deeply concerning. This is a dark time - a Russian aggression into a European state.

"What we need to do is to stand united in the face of that, come and express our solidarity in our support to Ukrainians living here in the United Kingdom, and of course, to those in Ukraine."

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer spoke about his warning to MPs who attack Nato.

He told journalists: "I was very clear in my remarks to the Labour Party yesterday that our support for Nato is unshakable.

"We were the party that was there at the foundation of Nato. It's been absolutely integral to the security and safety of Europe ever since.

"And there's no place for anybody in the Labour Party who makes the false equivalence between the aggression of Russia and defensive action of Nato and we're very, very clear about where we stand.

"This is a time when our values and our principles and where we stand matters more than practically any other time and that's a very important part of what I was saying to the Parliamentary Labour Party yesterday."

Sir Keir Starmer said he is calling for a review of the operating licence for Russian state-owned media outlet RT.

He told journalists: "I've called on the Government to review the operating licence for Russia Today, which frankly is the propaganda tool of Putin.

"And the sooner that they get on with that, the better, because there's a gulf of difference between journalism and free journalism, which we absolutely support.

"And some of these outlets which are a personal propaganda machine for Putin and his cronies."

Andriy Petryk, 51, a cab driver who moved from Ukraine to London 26 years ago, explained why he raised the issue of no-fly zones with Sir Keir Starmer during his visit to a church in west London.

He told the PA news agency: "At the moment forces are attacking Ukraine from the air. They are bombing hospitals, bombing schools, bombing civilians, which is totally unjust and unfair.

"So we would like your support to close Ukrainian skies because it's vitally important to do so at this time. We are begging to close our skies because Ukrainians are dying at every moment."

He described Sir Keir's response to his plea as "excellent".

The Financial Conduct Authority needs to remove a list of "non-complying cryptoasset dealers" from its website, as it is "certain" that cryptocurrency will be used extensively to avoid sanctions, a Labour former defence minister has said.

Speaking in the upper chamber, Lord Browne of Ladyton said: "It is certain that cryptocurrency will be used extensively to at least attempt to avoid these sanctions. There's no question about that.

"So for the second day in a row, can I try to persuade a minister to get the Financial Conduct Authority, who are the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing supervisor of UK cryptoasset businesses under the Money Laundering Regulations, to remove the list of non-complying cryptoasset dealers from their website.

"It is advertising money launderers to crooks and kleptocrats. Can it please be removed? There are 220 of them. It's not just the names, their websites and sometimes mobile phone numbers are there."

Foreign Office minister Lord Ahmad replied: "I certainly know very carefully what the noble Lord has said and of course, cryptocurrency as he has rightly articulated provides an opportunity to actually weave a way out of some of the sanctions, restrictions which are being employed.

"I've noticed very carefully what the noble Lord has said and of course I'll respond with more detail in due course."

Boris Johnson has told Nato troops the world enjoyed "greater peace and security because you are on the front line of our collective Western defence".

Making impromptu remarks to troops gathered at the Tapa army base in Estonia, he said: "I think what you're doing is fundamental for the safety, security of all of our nations, but also of our values - freedom, democracy, independent sovereign nations.

"That's what we believe in, that's what Nato sticks up for."

The Prime Minister met serving personnel alongside Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg and Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas.

He joked that Ms Kallas had told him British troops were "behaving particularly well", to which Ms Kallas told Mr Johnson they should "keep it that way".

When Mr Johnson asked the gathered troops who liked Tapa, he was met with muted cheers. When he asked who liked Tallinn, there was no audible reply.

Following his remarks the Prime Minister had a casual chat with Mr Stoltenberg before moving on to meet British personnel.

The only way Russia can be deprived of permanent UN Security Council membership is if Russia votes in favour of it, a Foreign Office minister has confirmed.

Speaking in the House of Lords, former head of the Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service Lord McDonald of Salford said: "Could the noble Lord the minister confirm a, that the arrangement in December '91 supervised by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, to have Russia as the successor state to the Soviet Union is legally watertight, so b, the only way Russia is deprived of permanent council membership is if Russia votes in favour of this?"

Foreign Office minister Lord Ahmad told peers he is proud of the UK leadership on "its lack of use of its veto power, whereas other countries have not done so".

He added: "What we have seen is that of course, the noble Lord is correct in that respect. However, what we have seen is other action. For example, at the Human Rights Council earlier today, when the foreign minister of Russia actually could not travel to Geneva.

"So for those who say the sanctions aren't working, the logistics of restriction on Russian-registered aircraft over certain countries actually prevented the foreign minister of Russia from travelling. When he spoke, a majority of delegations left the room.

"So there are measures or stands you can take within the diplomatic network that shows your immense, not just dissatisfaction but rejection of actions of a permanent five member."

Boris Johnson wished troops from the Royal Welsh regiment a happy St David's Day when he met them at the Tapa base.

The Prime Minister was shown around by Lt Colonel Simon Worth, Commanding Officer of the Royal Tank Regiment Battlegroup.

Speaking to personnel, Mr Johnson said it was "pretty nippy" in Estonia and discussed being allowed to drive one of the armoured military vehicles on a previous visit.

"When I first came here you let me drive one at some point," he said. "Straight over the tundra."

Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas tweeted: "Met with (Prime Minister Boris Johnson) in Tapa where British troops are with (Nato's enhanced Forward Presence).

"Must increase @NATO's deterrence & defence posture. Need to deliver all military and economic aid possible to Ukraine now.

"Tap into more ways to cripple Putin's war machine. Our duty: £StandWithUkraine."

The silence of Russian oligarchs with investments in the UK over the Ukraine invasion is "inexplicable", the Prime Minister has said.

"I think that their silence is inexplicable, and I think that people need to step up and denounce this act of aggression," Boris Johnson told ITV News on a trip to Poland.

"And those oligarchs who have connections with the Putin regime and who are benefiting from their association with the Russian state, we are going to expose and distrain their assets."

Ukraine's president has said he has had a conversation with his US counterpart Joe Biden.

Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted: "Just had a conversation with @POTUS. The American leadership on anti-Russian sanctions and defense assistance to Ukraine was discussed. We must stop the aggressor as soon as possible. Thank you for your support!"

The conversation came on day six of the Russian invasion of its neighbour.

The UK Government has imposed financial restrictions on Russia's sovereign wealth fund, a minister said.

As the Commons debated new sanctions against Russian-linked companies and individuals, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Ellis said: "It was also mentioned that we need to target those listed on the London Stock Exchange. We have as I said, prevented three million-plus Russian companies from listing on the London Stock Exchange.

"As the debate has been going on this very afternoon I can say to the House that we have designated the Russian Direct Investment Fund and its chief executive officer, Kirill Alexandrovich Dmitriev, and that has occurred during the course of this afternoon."

Four senior defence officials and two military enterprises have been sanctioned with immediate effect, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said.

This includes the Belarus Chief of the General Staff and First Deputy Minister of Defence, Major General Victor Gulevich; Major General Andrei Burdyko, Deputy Minister of Defence for Logistics and Chief of Logistics of the Belarusian Armed Forces; Deputy Minister of Defence for Armament and Chief of Armament of the Belarusian Armed Forces, Major General Sergei Simonenko; and Deputy Minister of Defence, Major General Andrey Zhuk.

State enterprises JSC 558 Aircraft Repair Plant and JSC Integral, a military semi-conductor manufacturer, have also been sanctioned, the FCDO said.

The move means the named individuals will not be able to travel to the UK and any UK-based assets will be frozen.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: "We are inflicting economic pain on Putin and those closest to him. We will not rest until Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity is restored.

"The Lukashenko regime actively aids and abets Russia's illegal invasion and will be made to feel the economic consequences for its support for Putin.

"There will be nowhere to hide. Nothing - and no-one - is off the table."

The UK is committing a further £80 million in aid to Ukraine to save lives, protect vulnerable people inside the country and in the wider region and to tackle the growing humanitarian crisis, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has announced.

The funding brings the total UK humanitarian aid package for Ukraine to £120 million after £40 million was announced last weekend to help aid agencies to respond to the deteriorating situation.

It takes the UK's overall aid support for Ukraine during the current crisis to £220 million, after a £100 million economic package for Ukraine was announced earlier this month, the FCDO said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: "With every hour, the passionate desire of the people of Ukraine to defend their country has become more apparent and millions of people around the world have been stirred and moved by their courage.

"The reality is that whatever happens in the coming days or weeks, the Ukrainian people have shown already that their spirit will not be broken, and they will not be subdued.

"We as the international community have a responsibility to do everything we can to help the Ukrainians."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: "We have a moral duty to support Ukrainians affected by Putin's unprovoked aggression.

"Britain is at the forefront of efforts to supply life-saving humanitarian aid, as well as political, economic and defensive support.

"Our message to the Ukrainian people is simple: we will help you and stand with you in the fight for the freedom and sovereignty of Ukraine."

Russian ships have been banned from UK ports, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has announced.

A statement said: "The ban includes any vessels owned or operated by anyone connected to Russia and authorities will also gain new powers to detain Russian vessels."

Additional economic measures introduced by Foreign Secretary Liz Truss prohibit UK individuals and entities from providing financial services to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, as well as the Ministry of Finance and National Wealth Fund.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: "We said Putin and those around him would pay the price for their unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine, and we are being true to our word.

"The ban on Russian ships from UK ports, and new economic sanctions against key Russian financial institutions including its central bank, in close co-ordination with our allies, will degrade Russia's economy and help make sure Putin loses.

"We stand with Ukraine, its people and its democracy, and will continue to support them diplomatically, economically, politically and defensively."

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: "Putin and his allies must feel the full consequences of their vicious and illegal invasion of Ukraine.

"That's why from today, I'm instructing all UK ports to turn away any vessel that is flagged, registered, owned, or operated by Russia.

"By banning Russian ships from our ports, we are further isolating Russia and crushing its economic capabilities, starving Putin's war machine."

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has confirmed the French satellite which broadcasts Russia Today (RT) in both the EU and UK will be switched off.

She wrote in a tweet: "Shortly, the French satellite which broadcasts Russia Today (RT) in both the EU and UK will be switched off.

"This means RT will no longer be available via Sky.

"Putin's polluting propaganda machine will now have severely restricted access into British homes via our TV screens."

* PM is on a trip to Poland and Estonia on latest diplomatic mission against Russia's aggression in Ukraine

* Boris Johnson has accused Putin of 'barbaric and indiscriminate' tactics and urged 'maximum pressure'

* Dismissed the prospect of a no-fly zone over Ukraine saying it would mean shooting down Russian planes

* He was berated by a tearful Ukrainian activist in Warsaw for failing to defend civilians after giving a speech

* Mr Johnson suggested that more than 200,000 refugees could end up coming to the UK from Ukraine

* Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Putin has 'blood on his hands' in speech to the UN Human Rights body

Vladimir Putin could reduce Kyiv 'to rubble' in the same way he destroyed the Chechen capital Grozny, after being cornered by the international community over the invasion of Ukraine, Boris Johnson warned tonight.

The Prime Minister warned the Russian leader against committing a 'unalterable moral humanitarian catastrophe' amid attacks on civilian targets in the capital designed to rejuvenate Moscow's stalled advance.

Explosions erupted around Kyiv's 1,300ft television tower this afternoon, just hours after Russia told civilians to evacuate because it was about to begin bombarding 'strategic' targets.

That raised fears that Kyiv was about to come under heavy bombardment, following indiscriminate shelling that earlier blasted the cities of Kharkiv, Mariupol and Kherson.

A column of Russian artillery units and tanks 40 miles long has been pictured snaking its way towards Kyiv as analysts warned it will likely be tasked with surrounding the city, besieging it and bombing it into submission as Putin resorts to 'medieval' tactics in an attempt to force victory.

Speaking to ITV News on a visit to Poland and Estonia, Mr Johnson said: 'I think that he's gone into a cul-de-sac and it's very difficult for him to back out, and that's the problem we've got.

'And if you're sitting where he is, his only instinct is going to be to double down and to try and 'Grozny-fy' Kyiv if you know what I mean. And to reduce it to [rubble], and I think that that would be an unalterable moral humanitarian catastrophe and I hope he doesn't do that.

'I hope he has the wisdom to see that there must be a better way forward but what he's got to do is to disengage, with the column of tanks, 40km long going towards Kyiv, he needs to put those tanks into reverse or turn them round and that is the number one thing.'

Russian forces spent more than a decade suppressing the independence movement in Chechnya, killing more than 100,000 people and laying waste to Grozny and large parts of the country.

[item name=video id=5517141 style=2 /]

At least five people were killed in the latest onslaught which came just hours after Russia told civilians to evacuate because it was about to begin bombarding 'strategic' targets.

It was not immediately clear whether the tower had been the target of the strikes, or whether they had been targeting nearby buildings. The tower remained standing, but several state broadcasts went off air.

After the latest attack, Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted: 'To the world: what is the point of saying "never again" for 80 years, if the world stays silent when a bomb drops on the same site of Babyn Yar? At least 5 killed. History repeating…'

Meanwhile the Ukrainian foreign ministry said: 'Russian troops fired on the TV tower, near the Memorial complex #BabynYar. Russian criminals do not stop at anything in their barbarism. Russia = barbarian.'

It came shortly after Moscow's ministry of defence said it would be launching strikes into the city targeting Ukraine's security service and intelligence agencies with what it called 'precision munitions'.

Mr Johnson today made clear there is no prospect of NATO enforcing a no-fly zone in Ukraine as he visited Estonia.

Flanked by the alliance's chief Jens Stoltenberg and Estonian counterpart Kaja Kallas at a press conference, the PM said the 'reality' is that the move would involve 'shooting down Russian planes'.

He also clarified that ministers are not encouraging Britons to go and fight for Ukraine, suggesting they would be breaking terror laws.

After meeting troops patrolling the border with Russia, Mr Stoltenberg pointedly committed to 'defending every inch of NATO territory'.

It was the second stop on Mr Johnson's latest diplomatic mission, after he stopped at Warsaw for talks this morning. In the Polish capital he was berated by a weeping Ukrainian activist who accused him of being 'afraid' to protect innocent women and children.

At the Tapa military base in Estonia this afternoon, Mr Johnson said: 'It's very, very important to understand Nato is a defensive alliance. This is a time when miscalculation and misunderstanding is all too possible and it's therefore crucial that we get that message over.

'When it comes to a no-fly zone in the skies above Ukraine we have to accept the reality that that involves shooting down Russian planes … that's a very, very big step, it's simply not on the agenda of any Nato country.'

Mr Johnson tried to clear up confusion sparked at the weekend when Foreign Secretary Liz Truss seemed to support Britons going to fight with Ukraine forces.

'I'm going to be very clear about this because you're not quite right in what you say about supporting volunteers going to fight, the UK is not actively doing such a thing,' he said.

'But I understand of course the feelings of people who feel emotionally engaged in this conflict because I cannot think of a time in international affairs when the difference between right and wrong, between good and evil, has been so obvious.

'I can understand why people feel as they do but we have laws in our country about international conflicts and how they must be conducted.

'Nato is a defensive alliance. I think for any Nato member to get involved actively in conflict with Russia is a huge step which is not being contemplated by any member.'

Mr Johnson told Nato troops the world enjoyed 'greater peace and security because you are on the front line of our collective Western defence'.

Making impromptu remarks to troops gathered at the Tapa army base in Estonia, he said: 'I think what you're doing is fundamental for the safety, security of all of our nations, but also of our values – freedom, democracy, independent sovereign nations.

'That's what we believe in, that's what Nato sticks up for.'

He joked that Ms Kallas had told him British troops were 'behaving particularly well', to which Ms Kallas told Mr Johnson they should 'keep it that way'.

Earlier, the PM was accused of being 'afraid' to defend people as he took a press conference on a visit to Poland.

Daria Kaleniuk said women and children were 'taking the hit' because NATO would not enforce a no-fly zone.

'You are not coming to Kyiv PM… because you are afraid,' she said, adding that NATO wanted to avoid World War III but it had 'already started'.

After listening in awkward silence, Mr Johnson replied that he was doing what he could, but 'cannot pretend' that the West will step in militarily.

'Unfortunately the implication of that would be that the UK would be engaged in shooting down Russian planes, engaged in direct combat with Russia, that's not something we can do,' he said.

The confrontation came after Mr Johnson accused Mr Putin of using 'barbaric and indiscriminate tactics' against innocent Ukrainian civilians.

As the invading forces escalated their attacks with harrowing pictures of children falling victim to the violence, he warned that the world was witnessing an 'unfolding disaster'.

The UN says at least 136 civilians have been killed so far, including 13 children, and hundreds more injured.

Mr Johnson said the UK 'stands ready' to take refugees in 'considerable numbers' - suggesting that could mean more than 200,000.

He also pledged to stay for the long haul, insisting Putin has 'fatally underestimated' the resolve of the West and Ukraine's citizens under the leadership of 'inspirational' Volodymyr Zelensky. He stressed there is still 'more things that we can and will do' on sanctions,

But Ms Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre civil society organisation, stood up to lambast the West's response.

Saying she had recently come over the border from Ukraine, she said her family and friends are still there.

'Ukrainian women and Ukrainian children are in deep fear because of bombs and missiles which are going from the sky.

'Ukrainian people are desperately asking for the rights to protect our sky, we are asking for a no-fly zone.

'What's the alternative for the no-fly zone?

'Nato is not willing to defend because Nato is afraid of World War Three but it's already started and it's Ukrainian children who are there taking the hit.

'You are talking about more sanctions Prime Minister but Roman Abramovich is not sanctioned, he's in London, his children are not in the bombardments, his children are there in London.'

She added: 'Putin's children are in Netherlands, in Germany, in mansions, where all these mentioned seized? I don't see that.

'I see that my family members, that my team members, I'd say that we crying.

'We don't know where to run.'

Mr Abramovich vehemently denies he is close to the Kremlin or has done anything that would merit sanctions being imposed against him.

The tearful Ukrainian campaigner who begged Boris to do more: American-educated anti-corruption chief fled Kyiv but has family and colleagues stuck in under-siege capital

The woman who broke down in tears as she demanded Boris Johnson tighten UK sanctions against Russia is a high-profile Ukrainian campaigner who helped establish the country's anti-corruption court.

Ms Kaleniuk is the co-founder and executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center (AntAC), an organisation that has shaped Ukraine's anti-corruption legislation.

Her group, which is funded by donations, and with the support of the US and the European Union, helped establish the country's National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), as well as the High Anti-Corruption Court of Ukraine - which was founded in 2019.

Ms Kaleniuk, who according to Linkedin studied law in Kharkiv before studying and working in the Chicago, US, for a year, co-founded the group with Vitaliy Shabunin, who is the head of the council of public control at NABU.

As co-founder of the group she has held talks with a number of high profile politicians, including Andy Baukol, then US acting Secretary of the Treasury, who she met in September last year, and George Kent, who served as US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs from 2018 to 2021.

She visited Washington last year with Hanna Hopko, a former Member of Parliament and head of the committee on foreign affairs of Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada and the influential chairwoman of Ukrainian Democracy in Action.

And pictures from 2020 show her in discussion with Larry Fink - the billionaire businessman behind the highly influential BlackRock, an American multinational investment firm with an annual revenue of more than $22billion.

The pair are said to have discussed investment and the environment, according to her Facebook post.

Alongsider her work with AntAC, Ms Kalniuk has also founded resources aiming to track money laundering and corruption across the world and last year organised a Zero Corruption conference in Kyiv, where she was living prior to the Russian invasion.

She told the press conference in Poland she had escaped Ukraine 'a couple of days' ago but that most of her family and team remained in under siege Kyiv.

Since the invasion of Ukraine, Ms Kaleniuk has called for heavy sanctions on Russia, including a no-fly, cutting Russia from the SWIFT banking system and arresting all Russian oligarchs and their family members - accusing them of being 'enablers' of the war.

She has demanded Russia be banned from world economy and financial markets and said Russia should be immediately removed from the UN Security Council.

She has also shared graphics comparing Vladimir Putin to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.

Ms Kalniuk, who is a mother of two, has previously shared her support for Hong Kong on social media, and has visited in China, having posted a picture of herself in the port city of Dalian in June 2019.

In his speech, Mr Johnson said it was clear Putin is willing to 'bomb tower blocks, to send missiles into tower blocks, to kill children, as we are seeing in increasing numbers'.

Heaping praise on Mr Zelensky he added: 'I think he has inspired and mobilised not only his own people, he is inspiring and mobilising the world in outrage at what is happening in Ukraine.'

In a nod to criticism of the government's visa offer to those fleeing Ukraine, Mr Johnson told Mr Morawiecki: 'We stand ready, clearly, to take Ukrainian refugees in our own country, working with you, in considerable numbers, as we always have done and always will.'

In a speech in Warsaw afterwards, Mr Johnson said Putin is 'tearing up every principle of civilised behaviour between states' and Ukraine's 'spirit will not be broken'.

'Putin has lied to his people and his troops about how this will go... and he has now been caught out in that lie.'

He added: 'He has hurled his war machine on the people of Ukraine, a fellow Slavic country, he has bombarded civilian targets, fired rockets at blocks of flats, he is responsible for hundreds of civilian casualties including growing numbers of children.

'And also, of course, for the deaths of many Russian and Ukrainian soldiers.

'We must accept the grim reality that Putin will continue to tighten the vice and, if you go by the size and firepower of Vladimir Putin's war machine, the odds have always been heavily against Ukrainian armed forces.'

Mr Johnson had 'tripped and stubbed his toe' on the fact that no matter how many troops and tanks he sends Ukrainians will want to be independent.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss today warned that 'nothing and no-one is off the table' when it comes to punishing Russia - amid claims of 'indisputable evidence' of war crimes.

She delivered a stark message to Vladimir Putin and his allies that they will be held accountable as she gave a speech to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.

Ms Truss said Mr Putin has 'blood on his hands' and the consequences 'will only increase in breadth and severity' as the conflict continues.

Delegates at the session staged a walkout when Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov appeared on screen to give a speech.

Meanwhile, Ireland has highlighted 'deliberate' targeting of civilians with a probe under way into the use of cluster bombs and vacuum bombs.

The UN says at least 136 civilians have been killed so far, including 13 children, and hundreds more injured.

Ms Truss told the UNHRC meeting: 'Putin is responsible for civilian casualties and over 500,000 people fleeing with the numbers still rising fast. The blood is on Putin's hands, not just of innocent Ukrainians but the men he has sent to die.

'We're using our collective heft, making up over half the world's economy to cut funding from Putin's war machine and we're delivering severe economic costs through these sanctions as ordinary Russians are finding form queues at their local banks and rising interest rates.'

Ms Truss went on: 'These consequences will only increase in breadth and severity as the conflict goes on, we're working to squeeze the Putin regime harder and harder by steadily tightening the vice.

'We're going after the highest echelons of the Russian elite, targeting President Putin personally and all of those complicit in his aggression. Nothing and no one is off the table.'

Earlier, Mr Johnson said that Russians considering whether to follow Mr Putin's orders should bear in mind that they will face justice in the end.

He pointed out that Radovan Karadzic was eventually convicted of genocide during the war in the former Yugoslavia.

Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said there is 'indisputable evidence' of Russian war crimes in Ukraine.

'We've seen I think indisputable evidence now that war crimes are taking place in Ukraine – the brutalising of a number of Ukrainian cities, the deliberate targeting of civilians,' he told reporters in Dublin.

'First of all, it is now under investigation from the International Criminal Court, who have now opened a file on potential war crimes in Ukraine, and I think that says a lot.

'But I think we can see for ourselves in terms of some of the social media pictures that are coming out, which I think are being stood over by the media organisations, as to the extent of civilian targeting in Ukrainian cities, which is essentially terrorising civilian populations.

'And that is something that can't go unchecked and we need to call it out.'

In a call with world leaders from the G7, Nato and the EU last night, Mr Johnson stressed the need for allies to continue to provide Kiev with defensive weapons.

He also said neighbouring countries will require support to deal with 'large numbers of Ukrainians escaping violence'.

Mr Zelensky is said to be providing the PM with a 'shopping list' of military gear to fight the Russian advance in near-daily phone calls.

In a round of interviews this morning, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab warned Putin could resort to 'even more barbaric tactics' as his campaign stalls, and insisted any war crimes must be pursued.

Daria Kaleniuk's emotional appeal to the PM in full

I passed the border a couple of days ago. I'm from Kyiv. Most of my family. Most of my team members are still in Ukraine in Kyiv, in Lviv. A woman from my team is now in Bilozerka. She is there with two kids, and Russian military is over there and she is so much afraid that she will be shot.

Kharkiv, the city where I was studying was bombed today, fully, the downtown square.

'So you're talking about the stoicism of the Ukrainian people. But Ukrainian women and Ukrainian children are in deep fear because of bombs and missiles which are going from the sky.

And Ukranian people are desperately asking for the West to protect our sky. We are asking for the no fly zone. We are saying response that it will trigger World war three.

But what is the alternative Mr Prime Minister, to observe how our children are instead of planes are protecting NATO from the missiles and bombs?

What's the alternative for the no fly zone? We have planes here we have air defence system in Poland in Romania.

NATO has this air defence, at least this air defence shield the Western Ukraine. So this these children with women could come to the border.

'It's impossible now to cross the border. There are 30 kilometres of mines. Imagine crossing the border with a baby or with two children.

'I'm so glad that Samantha Power is coming here to the border from the Polish side. Let her come to the border from Ukrainian side and see that.

'Britain guaranteed our security under Budapest Memorandum. So you're coming to Poland you're not coming to Kyiv Prime Minister, you're not coming to Lviv, because you are afraid.

Because NATO is not willing to defend. Because NATO is afraid of World War Three, but it is already started.

'And these are Ukrainian children who are there taking the hit. You're talking about more sanctions Prime Minister but Roman Abramovich is not sanctioned. He's in London. His children are not in the bombardments. His children are there in London.

Putin's children are in Netherlands, in Germany, in mansions, where all these mentioned seized? I don't see that.

I see that my family members, that my team members, I'd say that we crying. We don't know where to run.

This is what is happening. Prime Minister.

Mr Raab told Sky News: 'Those that engage in war crimes will be held to account.'

He said it must be clear to 'both to Putin but also to commanders in Moscow and on the ground in Ukraine that they will be held accountable for any violations of the laws of war'.

Voicing alarm at the prospects for escalation, Mr Raab said: 'We know that Putin will react to this, or we fear that he will react to this, with even more barbaric tactics, that's why we must be prepared that this could be a long haul.

The former foreign secretary added: 'This is turning into a much, much more perilous misadventure for Putin than I think he realised and it has a demoralised effect on Russia forces and it has had the effect of steeling the will of the Ukrainian people.

'That's how we will ensure Putin fails in Ukraine and we're there for the long haul.'

Belarus troops have invaded Ukraine, Kyiv claims, as 40-mile convoy of Putin's artillery snakes towards the capital amid fears Russia will 'use medieval tactics' to bomb the city into submission as supermarket shelves run empty

Belarusian troops have joined in the invasion of Ukraine, Kyiv claimed today, as a 40-mile Russian convoy bared down on the capital amid warnings that Putin will now use 'medieval tactics' to try and force a bloody victory after being handed a series of embarrassing defeats in the opening days of the war.

Vitaliy Kyrylov, a spokesman for Ukraine's North Territorial Defense Forces, said that Minsk's men had entered the city of Chernihiv, north-east Ukraine, on Tuesday morning. Dictator Alexander Lukashenko acknowledged sending 'rapid deployment groups' to the border 'to stop any military action against Belarus', without acknowledging that his men had joined the attack.

It came as a convoy of hundreds of Russian tanks, artillery pieces and trucks was pictured snaking its way towards Kyiv, leading to fears that its mission will be to surround the city, besiege it, and bomb it into submission as Russian forces did in Syria while fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad's forces.

Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, said Russian forces may also try to spark a food crisis by cutting off supplies to major cities as pictures showed some store shelves already running empty in the capital. He said the military may have to step in to ensure everyone has access to food.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg today said Putin had 'shattered peace in Europe' with an invasion 'enabled by Belarus' while vowing to support Kyiv and defend 'every inch' of allied territory should the Russian strongman's sights wander outside Ukraine's borders.

But, speaking during a visit to the Lask airbase in NATO member Poland, Mr Stoltenberg repeated that the alliance is 'defensive' and that no troops will be sent to assist Ukraine. 'NATO is not going to be part of the conflict,' he said.

Russia already appeared to be employing siege tactics elsewhere in Ukraine today as the city of Mariupol, in the south, came under 'constant shelling' by Russian forces using artillery, Grad rockets, and fighter jets targeting civilians areas such as schools and homes which had left many dead, including women and children.

Power to the city, which is in danger of being surrounded by Russian forces, has been cut - region head Pavlo Kyrylenko said Tuesday - but it remains under Ukrainian control.

Kherson, another key city located in southern Ukraine with a bridge over the Dnieper River, also came under bombardment by Russian forces today as missiles landed near civilian buildings on the outskirts and troops were pictured moving through the streets.

Kharkiv, in the east, continued to be bombed today with a large rocket landing in front of the civilian public administration building, leaving the interior heavily damaged. It came just a day after the city was hit by cluster bombs that landed near a shopping centre, killing at least 11 people and leaving dozens more wounded.

Ukraine's ambassador to the UN later said that a thermobaric 'vacuum bomb' was also used on the country, though did not saying exactly when or where.

President Volodymyr Zelensky this morning branded the Kharkiv bombing a 'terrorist' attack and branded Russia a 'terrorist state' while repeating calls for a war crimes investigation. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court at The Hauge has said that a probe will be established 'as soon as possible'.

Philip Reeker, America's Charge d'Affairs to the UK, warned separately that 'medieval tactics are certainly what we can expect' from Moscow's forces going forward. '[That is] exactly what President Putin and the Russian military have in mind,' he added.

Sergey Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, said Tuesday morning that the invasion will continue until 'objectives are met' - which he said was to prevent Russia being threatened by the West.

In a grim sign of the carnage to come, he also warned that Ukraine's army is using civilians as human shields in what looks to be an attempt to justify the deaths of innocents as they ramp up over the coming days.

Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch both said that Russian forces appeared to have used widely banned cluster munitions, with Amnesty accusing them of attacking a preschool in northeastern Ukraine while civilians took shelter inside.

Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, told reporters after meeting with members of the U.S. Congress that Russia had used a thermobaric weapon, known as a vacuum bomb, in its invasion of her country.

'They used the vacuum bomb today,' Markarova said after a meeting with lawmakers. '...The devastation that Russia is trying to inflict on Ukraine is large.'

A vacuum bomb, or thermobaric weapon, sucks in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion, typically producing a blast wave of a significantly longer duration than that of a conventional explosive and is capable of vaporizing human bodies.

There has been no official confirmation that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine. CNN reported that one of its teams had spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rocket launcher near the Ukrainian border early on Saturday afternoon.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said she had seen reports but did not have confirmation that Russia had used such weapons. 'If that were true, it would potentially be a war crime,' she told a press briefing, noting that there are international organizations that would assess that and President Joe Biden's administration 'would look to be a part of that conversation.'

The Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.

Markarova said Ukraine was working actively with the Biden administration and Congress to obtain more weapons and tougher sanctions.

'They should pay, they should pay a heavy price,' she told reporters after leaving the meeting.

One lawmaker who attended the meeting, Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, said the Ukrainians had asked for a U.S.-enforced no-fly zone over Ukraine but that he felt that was too dangerous because it could provoke conflict with Russia.

Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could retaliate with increasingly 'heavy-handed tactics' if his invasion of Ukraine faces further hitches.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We can expect, for every stutter and stumble, him to try and come back for even more heavy-handed tactics, but that is a sign that the initial phase at least - and this is going to be a long haul - has not lived up to his expectations.'

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has thanked the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for their support amid the Russian invasion.

'Olena and I are grateful to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge that, at this crucial time, when Ukraine is courageously opposing Russia's invasion, they stand by our country and support our brave citizens,' he tweeted.

'Good will triumph.'

Amnesty International said international humanitarian law prohibits the use of inherently indiscriminate weapons such as cluster munitions. Launching indiscriminate attacks that kill or injure civilians constitutes a war crime.

As the bloodshed ramps up, the Kremlin has found itself increasingly isolated by tough economic sanctions that have sent its currency plummeting.

After a first, five-hour session of talks between Ukraine and Russia yielded no stop in the fighting, both sides agreed to another meeting in coming days. Ukraine's embattled president, however, said he believed the stepped-up shelling was designed to force him into concessions.

'I believe Russia is trying to put pressure (on Ukraine) with this simple method,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late Monday in a video address. He did not offer details of the talks that took place Monday, but he said Kyiv was not prepared to make concessions 'when one side is hitting another with rocket artillery.'

Six days into the invasion, the Russian military's movements have been stalled by fierce resistance on the ground and a surprising inability to dominate the airspace. Many Ukrainian civilians, meanwhile, spent another night huddled in shelters, basements or corridors.

'I sit and pray for these negotiations to end successfully, so that they reach an agreement to end the slaughter,' said Alexandra Mikhailova, weeping as she clutched her cat in a shelter in Mariupol. Around her, parents tried to console children and keep them warm.

The Kremlin has twice in as many days raised the specter of nuclear war and put on high alert an arsenal that includes intercontinental ballistic missiles and long-range bombers. Stepping up his rhetoric, President Vladimir Putin denounced the United States and its allies as an 'empire of lies.'

Meanwhile, an embattled Ukraine moved to solidify its ties to the West by applying to join the European Union - a largely symbolic move for now, but one that won't sit well with Putin, who has long accused the United States of trying to pull Ukraine out of Moscow's orbit.

A top Putin aide and head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, said that during the first talks held between the sides since the invasion, the envoys 'found certain points on which common positions could be foreseen.' He said they agreed to continue the discussions in the days ahead.

As the talks along the Belarusian border wrapped up, several blasts could be heard in Kyiv, and Russian troops advanced on the city of nearly 3 million. The convoy of armored vehicles, tanks, artillery and support vehicles was 17 miles (25 kilometers) from the center of the city and stretched about 40 miles, according to satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies.

People in Kyiv lined up for groceries after the end of a weekend curfew, standing beneath a building with a gaping hole blown in its side. Kyiv remained 'a key goal' for the Russians, Zelenskyy said, noting that it was hit by three missile strikes on Monday and that hundreds of saboteurs were roaming the city.

'They want to break our nationhood, that's why the capital is constantly under threat,' Zelenskyy said.

Messages aimed at the advancing Russian soldiers popped up on billboards, bus stops and electronic traffic signs across the capital. Some used profanity to encourage Russians to leave. Others appealed to their humanity.

'Russian soldier - Stop! Remember your family. Go home with a clean conscience,' one read.

Video from Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-biggest city, with a population of about 1.5 million, showed residential areas being shelled, with apartment buildings shaken by repeated, powerful blasts.

Authorities in Kharkiv said at least seven people had been killed and dozens injured. They warned that casualties could be far higher.

'They wanted to have a blitzkrieg, but it failed, so they act this way,' said 83-year-old Valentin Petrovich, who watched the shelling from his downtown apartment. He gave just his first name and his patronymic, a middle name derived from his father's name, out of fear for his safety.

The Russian military has denied targeting residential areas despite abundant evidence of shelling of homes, schools and hospitals.

Fighting raged in other towns and cities. The strategic port city of Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, is 'hanging on,' said Zelenskyy adviser Oleksiy Arestovich. An oil depot was reported bombed in the eastern city of Sumy.

Russian artillery hit a military base in Okhtyrka, a city between Kharkiv and Kyiv, and more than 70 Ukrainian soldiers were killed, the head of the region wrote on Telegram. Dmytro Zhyvytskyy posted photographs of the charred shell of a four-story building and rescuers searching rubble.

In a later Facebook post, he said many Russian soldiers and some local residents also were killed during the fighting on Sunday. The report could not immediately be confirmed.

Despite its superior military strength, Russia still lacked control of Ukrainian airspace. This may help explain how Ukraine has so far prevented a rout.

In the seaside resort town of Berdyansk, dozens of protesters chanted angrily in the main square against Russian occupiers, yelling at them to go home and singing the Ukrainian national anthem. They described the soldiers as exhausted young conscripts.

'Frightened kids, frightened looks. They want to eat,' Konstantin Maloletka, who runs a small shop, said by telephone. He said the soldiers went into a supermarket and grabbed canned meat, vodka and cigarettes.

'They ate right in the store,' he said. 'It looked like they haven't been fed in recent days.'

For many, Russia's announcement of a nuclear high alert stirred fears that the West could be drawn into direct conflict with Russia. But a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States had yet to see any appreciable change in Russia's nuclear posture.

As far-reaching Western sanctions on Russian banks and other institutions took hold, the ruble plummeted, and Russia's Central Bank scrambled to shore it up, as did Putin, signing a decree restricting foreign currency.

But that did little to calm Russian fears. In Moscow, people lined up to withdraw cash as the sanctions threatened to drive up prices and reduce the standard of living for millions of ordinary Russians.

In yet another blow to Russia's economy, oil giant Shell said it was pulling out of the country because of the invasion. It announced it will withdraw from its joint ventures with state-owned gas company Gazprom and other entities and end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project between Russia and Europe.

The economic sanctions, ordered by the U.S. and other allies, were just one contributor to Russia's growing status as a pariah country.

Russian airliners are banned from European airspace, Russian media is restricted in some countries, and some high-tech products can no longer be exported to the country. On Monday, in a major blow to a soccer-mad nation, Russian teams were suspended from all international soccer.

In other developments:

- The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said he will open an investigation soon into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.

- Cyberattacks hit Ukrainian embassies around the world, and Russian media outlets.

- The United States announced it is expelling 12 members of Russia's U.N. mission, accusing them of spying.

The U.N. human rights chief said at least 102 civilians have been killed and hundreds wounded - warning that figure is probably a vast undercount - and Ukraine's president said at least 16 children were among the dead.

More than a half-million people have fled the country since the invasion, another U.N. official said, many of them going to Poland, Romania and Hungary.

Among the refugees in Hungary was Maria Pavlushko, 24, an information technology project manager from a city west of Kyiv. She said her father stayed behind to fight the Russians.

'I am proud about him,' she said, adding that many of her friends were planning to fight, too.

NO NATO ALLIES ARE CONSIDERING A NO-FLY ZONE OVER UKRAINE, BORIS JOHNSON SAYS

Boris Johnson has insisted no Nato allies are contemplating heeding Ukraine's pleas to enforce a no-fly zone over the nation to prevent bombings from Vladimir Putin's planes.

The Prime Minister again rejected Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky's calls for British forces to actively join the effort, warning it would trigger a wider war with Russia.

With the invasion of Ukraine in its sixth day, Mr Johnson visited Nato members Poland and Estonia to shore up support for the defence alliance.

But he ruled out British forces fighting in Ukraine, as he faced impassioned calls for a no-fly zone to be imposed to protect civilians as a major assault on Kyiv was feared to be nearing.

Mr Johnson clarified that the UK is not actively supporting British nationals volunteering to help the defence of Ukraine, contradicting an earlier remark from Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.

"I think for any Nato member to get involved actively in conflict with Russia is a huge step which is not being contemplated by any member," Mr Johnson stressed during a press conference against the backdrop of armoured vehicles, at the Tapa military base in Estonia.

"This is a time when miscalculation and misunderstanding is all too possible and it's therefore crucial that we get that message over.

"When it comes to a no-fly zone in the skies above Ukraine we have to accept the reality that that involves shooting down Russian planes ... that's a very, very big step, it's simply not on the agenda of any Nato country.

"We will not fight Russian forces in Ukraine," he added. "Our reinforcements like these reinforcements here in Tapa are firmly within the borders of Nato members."

Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg warned that a vast column of "heavy Russian armour" moving towards Kyiv would bring "more death, more suffering and more civilian casualties", as he stressed the need for heavy sanctions.

Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas said troops from Kremlin-ally Belarus had entered Ukraine, adding: "There's no doubt Belarus is a co-aggressor in this conflict."

In an earlier visit to Warsaw, Poland, a Ukrainian journalist who fled over the border made an impassioned plea for Mr Johnson to assist with a no-fly zone.

Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre civil society organisation, said: "Nato is not willing to defend because Nato is afraid of World War Three, but it's already started and it's Ukrainian children who are there taking the hit."

Mr Johnson apologised as he ruled out the move, having blamed Mr Putin's regime for "barbaric and indiscriminate" violence against Ukrainian citizens.

The Prime Minister said evidence of Mr Putin's attacks on civilians could be used in a future trial at the International Criminal Court.

Mr Johnson committed to doing more to allow Ukrainians to come to the UK, with around 200,000 eligible under an expanded route for people to bring family members in.

"What we are going to do is we are extending the family scheme so that actually very considerable numbers would be eligible ... you could be talking about a couple of hundred thousand, maybe more," he said.

"Additionally, we are going to have a humanitarian scheme and then a scheme by which UK companies and citizens can sponsor individual Ukrainians to come to the UK."

While the Prime Minister was in the air on the way back to Britain, the UK Government announced a further £80 million in aid for Ukraine.

The funding will be used to save lives, protect vulnerable people inside the country and in the wider region, and to tackle the growing humanitarian crisis, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) announced.

The department said it takes the UK's overall aid support during the current crisis to £220 million.

The FCDO also announced an additional economic strike will be applied against the Russian Central Bank and the state's sovereign wealth fund in a sanction - being applied in partnership with the US and EU - that is designed to prevent Russia from using foreign reserves in ways that could allow it to lessen the financial impact of global measures on its economy.

Satellite images showed the extent of the Russian forces massing around Kyiv, with a column of armoured vehicles, tanks, artillery and support vehicles stretching 40 miles.

That force was 17 miles from the capital on Monday.

Ukraine has already accused Moscow of war crimes by bombarding civilian areas in the second city of Kharkiv.

But Western leaders fear that the Russian president could order more "barbaric" tactics, with intelligence suggesting the advance on Kyiv has made little progress, probably due to logistical problems.

Meanwhile, there was a mass walkout of diplomats from the UN Human Rights Council when a speech from Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov began.

UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Mr Lavrov's statement was "full of disinformation" and did not deserve the attention of other members.

"Russia is isolated and should be ashamed to sit in the UN chamber," she said.

During her own speech to the Geneva meeting, Ms Truss said: "Putin is responsible for civilian casualties and over 500,000 people fleeing with the numbers still rising fast. The blood is on Putin's hands - not just of innocent Ukrainians, but the men he has sent to die."

The Russian military is a "ruthless invading force" which poses a danger...

The Russian military is a "ruthless invading force" which poses a danger immediately to Ukraine, but also to "wider Europe and the world".

Damian Hinds, the UK's security minister, told Sky News: "How concerned am I? We are all desperately concerned.

"This is a ruthless invading force. When it comes to tactics and military strategy, I'm not going to second guess Vladimir Putin and what he might be thinking, what might be in his head.

"But we do know that this is a ruthless force, an extremely dangerous (force) obviously imminently right now for Ukraine, but actually dangerous for wider Europe and the world.

"The bravery, the tenacity of Ukraine, my God, we have all been taken aback and it is so important we do everything we can to support them in what they are doing and make sure - and this is where the sanctions, we've got the Economic Crime Bill, transparency and enforcement coming through on Monday in Parliament.

"It is why all these things are so important, why we absolutely need to make the regime hurt."

There is no suggestion of delay in helping Ukrainian refugees, with a further UK scheme to open on Friday, a minister has said.

Security minister Damian Hinds said he wanted to make sure those fleeing the Russian invasion had the "warmest, most supportive welcome possible" in Britain.

He said as well as a "couple of hundred thousand" entering via the extended family programme - which will be open to applications on Friday - others would be eligible via a "community sponsorship route", along with already established schemes.

"There is absolutely no suggestion of any kind of delay here - people need help now," he told Sky News.

Asked how many visa applications had been submitted since last Wednesday, Mr Hinds said: "So far a relatively small number - I can't give you an exact number - but we expect that to grow rapidly.

"So we are stepping up the capacity. We are very soon up to capacity for 6,000, and we will keep that under review and if it needs to increase, it will increase - and that's just in the immediate region. There is also of course application centres across Europe."

The wealth of Russian oligarchs with British investments will not prevent the UK Government from "going after" them, the security minister said.

Put to him that Boris Johnson's administration is "scared" of targeting wealthy Russian elites due to the "legal implications", Damian Hinds told BBC Breakfast: "No.

"You shouldn't overlook or just ignore what I just said about people who have already been sanctioned - that is very material in these circumstances.

"And there will be more individuals (who) can be sanctioned.

"And we do understand some of these are deep-pocketed people - that doesn't mean they are immune or exempt in any way.

"We will be going after people as needed."

Damian Hinds said it would "be neither right nor wise" to comment on Roman Abramovich, after the Chelsea owner announced his intention to sell the Premier League football club.

The security minister, asked on ITV's Good Morning Britain whether sanctions against the Russian billionaire were being considered, said: "It would be neither right nor wise of me to comment on individuals.

"I don't think we should let individuals know what is going to happen before it happens.

"But in any case, I wouldn't talk about an individual case unless and until there were measures in place.

"But people should know we've already put in place sanctions on individuals and there will be more to come."

Asked whether he knew what Mr Abramovich meant when he said "net proceeds" from the sale of the club would go to the victims of the war in Ukraine, Mr Hinds said: "No, because you can define net proceeds in different ways, as any corporate financier would tell you."

The Defence Secretary said the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine will "ripple through Europe" for "years to come" as he called on president Vladimir Putin to call off the conflict.

Ben Wallace, speaking at a press conference in Estonia, said: "The message to Putin is: Stop.

"It isn't too late to stop what you are doing. What you have done so far is illegal and you risk being isolated for decades to come."

Mr Wallace added: "This hasn't finished here. The consequences of what we are seeing in Ukraine will ripple through Europe and Nato for not just weeks but months and years to come."

Answering a question from a reporter, he said it would "be very hard for the international community to engage" with Mr Putin "in the long-term" following his invasion of a "sovereign country at huge scale, inflicting huge damage and violence".

Mr Wallace said the idea of having a "normal relationship with the Russian government" would be "almost impossible as a result of what we have seen in Ukraine unless president Putin chooses to cease what he is doing now".

A minister appeared to suggest the UK could look to seize assets of Russian oligarchs as part of its next sanctioning steps.

Told on LBC that German authorities had seized Alisher Usmanov's yacht and asked whether similar action on elite Russians should be taken in Britain, security minister Damian Hinds said: "Yeah.

"And look, we are going to go further.

"We've acted very quickly on the initial round of sanctions - that includes individuals as well as organisations, banks and so on - but we've always been clear it is a ratchet approach and there can be more to come.

"Specifically on assets, we've got legislation going through Parliament at the moment - we're debating it on Monday - to include bolstering unexplained wealth orders, which are a potentially potent tool that can open investigations to lead to the proceeds of crime being seized.

"We need to gum up that system, we need to stop it, to stop the money laundering, but also, as you rightly say, where it is possible - and obviously we operate within a legal framework - we are absolutely motivated to seize the proceeds of crime."

There is "every indication Vladimir Putin is absolutely guilty" of war crimes, the UK's security minister said.

Welcoming the International Criminal Court (ICC) opening an investigation on Wednesday after Russia was referred by Britain and 37 allies, Damian Hinds told LBC: "As the Prime Minister said the other day, there is every indication Vladimir Putin is absolutely guilty.

"But it is also really important that not only he, but the generals, the officers in his army, know that evidence is being gathered and that people can be held to account through the international justice system."

A "line has clearly been crossed" by Russia in its attacks on Ukraine, a Cabinet minister said.

Speaking at a press briefing in Estonia, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: "How far he (Russian president Vladimir Putin) will go, what weapons he will authorise to achieve his ultimate aim is unknown.

"But we have seen the use of massive amounts of artillery, we've seen the deployment of thermobaric artillery weapon systems and we worry how broad those could go.

"So whatever happens in Ukraine, and we hope and support the Ukrainian government and its armed forces resisting Russia, there is a line that has clearly been crossed and that will have an impact on Nato and its defence.

"It will have impact on the neighbours and their views and their fears.

"And right across the world, people will wonder what type of Russia we are going to see as a result of this invasion."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said tackling Russian aggression was a fight for "all of our freedom and security".

Speaking at a press conference in Lithuania, Ms Truss outlined the steps already taken by the UK, but said "we need to go further" by including all Russian banks in the ban from the Swift payment system, and reducing dependency on hydrocarbons from Russia.

She said: "This is a struggle not just for Ukraine's freedom and self-determination, but for all of our freedom and security.

"By continuing to respond with strengths we will together ensure that Putin loses."

Liz Truss said the West needs to "get the information" to the Russian people about what is "actually happening" in Ukraine in the face of reports from state-owned media at home.

Speaking at a press conference in Lithuania, the Foreign Secretary said she did not believe that President Vladimir Putin "speaks on behalf of Russian people".

She said: "What we have seen over the last week is some very brave people in Russia protesting, standing up against the regime.

"And we need to make sure that we get the information to them about what is actually happening.

"It is much harder to control information in the world of social media.

"And we need to make sure, as I've said, that the Russian economy is crippled so it is unable to continue to fund Putin and the war machine.

"And I suspect that the Russian people will draw their own conclusions from that."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was asked what can be done to achieve a "humanitarian corridor" to help people fleeing Ukraine, and ensure medical supplies reach the most vulnerable.

Speaking at a press conference in Lithuania, she said: "Well, you are absolutely right about the dire situation, and the United Kingdom has sent teams to the border to assist, particularly in Poland, but also in other countries facing those issues.

"I was in Geneva... the day before yesterday, meeting the UN and others to talk about making sure a humanitarian corridor is established for the safe passage of aid and humanitarian support."

The board of OneWeb has voted to suspend all launches from Baikonur, the communications firm has announced.

It means the London-based company's planned launch of 36 broadband satellites from Kazakhstan on Friday, in collaboration with the Russian space agency, will not go ahead.

The UK Government owns a £400 million share in the digital outfit, and there had been calls from MPs for ministers to reconsider the co-operation between OneWeb and Russia in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Vladimir Putin is "suffering a sporting and cultural Siberia" that will be causing him "real pain", Nadine Dorries told MPs.

She said that culture was "the third front" in the war in Ukraine, as she outlined the sporting and cultural bans that Russia had faced.

The Culture Secretary told the Commons: "Putin is now suffering a sporting and cultural Siberia of its own making, and it will be causing the Russian leader real pain."

Ms Dorries said she had recently made the UK's position on Russia's participation in international sports events clear to sports bodies, telling them: "Russia should be stripped of hosting international sporting events and Russian teams should not be allowed to compete abroad.

"Across sports, across the arts and entertainment we are ostracising Putin off the global stage."

Flat-pack furniture giant Ikea has temporarily closed all retail and manufacturing operations in Russia and Belarus in a move impacting around 15,000 workers.

The Swedish group said it would also pause all export and import in and out of Russia and Belarus.

Brand owner Inter Ikea and store owner Ingka Group said they had "secured employment and income stability" for the workers directly impacted by the decisions.

Ikea said: "The war has a huge human impact already.

"It is also resulting in serious disruptions to supply chain and trading conditions.

"For all of these reasons, the company groups have decided to temporarily pause Ikea operations in Russia."

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has said Ofcom is now reviewing whether to revoke Russia Today's broadcast licence entirely.

She told the Commons that Vladimir Putin "must not be allowed to exploit our open and free media to spread poisonous propaganda into British homes".

She added: "And that is why I wrote to Ofcom last week urging them to examine any potential breaches of the broadcasting code.

"Ofcom has since opened 27 investigations into RT, and they are now reviewing whether to revoke RT's licence entirely.

"In the meantime, those investigations have been taken over by events and I was very glad to see yesterday that the channel is now officially off air on British televisions, after it shut down on Sky, Freeview and Freesat."

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries was close to the tears in the House of Commons as she thanked all the journalists in Ukraine who are "risking their lives" "to bring us unbiased and accurate news".

She said: "I'd just like to offer my heartfelt thanks and admiration... to all of those journalist working for the BBC, the ITV and other news outlets who are risking their lives to bring us unbiased and accurate news from a live warzone."

Ms Dorries added: "We will keep ratcheting up the pressure on Putin and I will use all the levers in my department to ensure that he is fully ostracised from the international community."

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries told MPs she has called on Unesco to bar Russia from hosting its annual world heritage conference in June.

Ms Dorries said that if it goes ahead, the UK "will not be attending".

She told MPs: "It's why I called on Unesco to bar Russia from hosting its annual world heritage conference in June.

"It's absolutely inconceivable that this event could go ahead in Putin's country as he fires missiles at innocent civilians in neighbouring Ukraine.

"If it does go ahead, the UK will not be attending.

"And it's why I urged the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) International Paralympic Committee (IPC) yesterday to urgently rethink its decision to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete. This pressure works.

"The IPC's decision was the wrong call. And I welcome the fact that overnight they have listened and have reversed that decision this morning."

Labour shadow culture minister Chris Elmore called for no Russian or Belarusian to play at the Wimbledon tennis tournament.

He welcomed the statement from Nadine Dorries, and spoke of the courage of the Ukrainian people as well as expressing support for journalists reporting on the war and countering Vladimir Putin's "disinformation", describing them as "heroes".

He said sport binds a nation but can "offer a cloak of legitimacy and deflection" to "despots like Putin" who he said crave its spotlight and value hosting and competing in international competitions, and called for Russia and Belarus to be "banned from international competitions".

He said "some regrettably have dragged their feet or are hedging their bets" and said international sport and cultural bodies "must hit Putin where it hurts and send a clear, immediate and unequivocal message to the Russian people that Putin has turned their country into a pariah state". He said "we must should see no fudges, no ifs, no buts, outright bans".

He said: "Russian and Belarusian will still be able to play at upcoming grand slams including Wimbledon, just under a neutral flag. I can see the Secretary of State shaking her head, so therefore will she agree with me and with this side of the House that we must do more to ensure there is a total ban in terms of the tennis tournaments ensuring that no Russian or Belarusian will play in Wimbledon?"

He also asked the Government to act "quickly on (Roman) Abramovich and other oligarchs to ensure that they can't profit from Putin's war. Why is the Government allowing oligarchs like Abramovich time and notice to sort out their affairs and divest themselves of any assets which otherwise would be subject to sanctions?"

Former England and Chelsea captain John Terry was criticised by a Labour MP for posting a photo of himself with Roman Abramovich.

Chris Bryant told the Commons it was a "mystery" to him why Mr Abramovich "has not yet been sanctioned", with the Russian-Israeli billionaire on Wednesday announcing his intention to sell Chelsea.

Former minister Mr Bryant asked Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries: "I wonder whether she would condemn John Terry today. I don't know whether she's seen this but he has posted today a photo of himself with Roman Abramovich, who is one of Putin's cronies.

"What will the people of Ukraine think of the former England football captain?"

Mr Abramovich could come under UK Government sanctions given his proximity to the Russian state, though he is also understood to have been attempting to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said she hopes countries will take a "joint position" on addressing the issue of Russian participation in sport.

Responding to Labour she said "all of" their points are being addressed, and she noted Labour raised issues of athletes competing under neutral flags and Wimbledon and other events, saying: "I am holding a summit this afternoon with in excess of 20 of my ministerial opposites in countries around the world, and I'm hoping we can take a joint position on this.

"I think it's important that this is a global approach as far as is possible because that is what will have more impact, is what will be a sustainable position in the long-term.

"And some of these issues are very difficult issues in terms of athletes who have trained all of their lives to compete."

She added: "We are not anti the Russian people, we are anti Putin and his regime. However, the actions of Putin have consequences and this afternoon at the summit I'm hoping to reach - and hopefully we will release a statement afterwards - a position on many of the issues that he has mentioned."

Labour shadow culture minister Chris Elmore also said the Online Safety Bill should include additional measures on tackling "disinformation" before it is put to the House for second reading.

Downing Street has denied the Foreign Office has been held back from issuing sanctions against Russian oligarchs because officials are struggling to prove reasonable grounds.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "I wouldn't recognise that. We are not being held back from introducing sanctions.

"We've gone further and faster than we ever have done before but we do have laws that we need to abide when it comes to how we apply these sanctions and we are following them.

"As you would expect we keep under constant review whether or not we can do more to allow us to go even faster."

Downing Street has said sanctioning large banks and companies is what will "throttle off funding" for the Russian invasion and is more effective than targeting oligarchs.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "When it comes to individuals it is the case that we need to do the preparatory work, the requisite work, to make sure it is legally sound before introduction. Like I said, we will keep that under review and if there are ways to further speed it up then we will.

"I wouldn't want people to get lost on the fact of just focusing on individuals. Obviously what is important is what puts the most pressure on Putin's regime.

"Our judgment is placing sanctions particularly on large banks and companies... that is what we believe will exert the most pressure on Putin's regime and will throttle off funding for this illegal war against Ukraine."

English football has "reached a turning point" after having "tolerated the investment of Russian kleptocrats for far too long", the Culture Secretary has said.

Nadine Dorries praised Labour MP Chris Bryant for his work on raising matters connected to Russia over the years, adding she has "heard everything" he has said in the last week on sanctions.

She insisted the Foreign Office is working on the matter of sanctions, adding in the Commons: "In football, I agree with him and we have tolerated the investment of Russian kleptocrats for far too long.

"Yesterday's announcement showed that I think that we have reached a turning point. We need to make sure that football clubs remain viable, that is an important point.

"We're bringing forward our response to the fan-led review as soon as I possibly can and an independent regulator and a fit-and-proper-person test for owners; seems to me - this is the fan-led review by my colleague Tracey Crouch - and it couldn't have come at a more opportune time and I see this as a turning point and there can be no arguments against bringing this forward.

"I agree with much of what (Mr Bryant) says, he knows I'm limited in what I am able to do in my department, I cannot mention names and I hope we will see the Foreign Office come forward with the sanctions he's looking for."

Downing Street has denied it could take months to prove the grounds to sanction some Russian oligarchs under measures to apply pressure on the Putin regimes.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "I don't recognise that certainly, I think we've said we're bringing sanctions against more individuals including 571 members of the Duma and Federation Council, we've been working on some of these sanctions in weeks and you will see more and more individuals added to that list as it grows."

Asked if it could be weeks, he responded: "You will see over the coming days and weeks more and more sanctions come in."

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said she hopes Kremlin-backed broadcaster RT will lose its licence and is "never again able or have the platform to broadcast their propaganda into the UK".

Conservative former minister David Jones asked Ms Dorries: "Can you convey to Ofcom what I perceive to be the feeling of this House that it would be deplored if Russia Today was ever to be seen on British screens again?"

Ms Dorries replied: "I absolutely agree with (Mr Jones), I published the letter that I wrote to Ofcom shortly after I wrote it last week; they've launched 27 live investigations into Russia Today.

"I'm hoping they expediate those investigations and that those investigations result in the removal of Russia Today's licence so they're never again able or have the platform to broadcast their propaganda into the UK."

Earlier, Ms Dorries said in response to SNP questions: "As part of a concerted effort and discussions, Russia Today is no longer streamed into British homes either via TV, Sky, Freesat or Freeview.

"We have contacted both Meta and TikTok to implore them to stop streaming Russia Today via their own online platforms. It is my absolute position that we will not stop until we have persuaded every organisation based in the UK or not that it is the wrong thing to do to stream Russian propaganda into British homes."

Conservative former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith told the Commons: "I hear the Government is thinking about a trade deal with China and I hear that the Government thinks China can be an interlocutor with Russia.

"Can I just remind (Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries) and the Government that in 1940, a similar argument was advanced that Mussolini was going to be the interlocutor with Hitler; Churchill refused that.

"When will the lesson be learned?"

Labour's Kevin Brennan pressed Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries on whether it is "acceptable" that the assets of Uzbekistan-born Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov are "currently funding Everton Football Club".

The MP for Cardiff West said: "He (Mr Usmanov) has been sanctioned by the EU and for being a pro-Kremlin oligarch with particularly close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Does she think it's acceptable that his assets are currently funding Everton Football Club?"

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said she could not comment on that particular football club, adding: "As he many know, my grandfather is one of the founders of that particular football club and, as I have said, we are waiting for the Foreign Office and the sanctions that the Foreign Office are working on.

"But you know, it's my point that we have reached a turning point in football ownership in this country, which is why I will use every power that I have, both in my office and in department, to ensure that we bring forward a fit-and-proper-person test for football club owners, and we bring forward an independent regulator as soon as possible."

Everton have suspended commercial ties with Mr Usmanov's companies.

On Wednesday, an Everton statement read: "The club can confirm that it has suspended with immediate effect all commercial sponsorship arrangements with the Russian companies USM, Megafon and Yota."

It is still legal for companies in the UK to buy Russian gas if it is transported on non-Russian ships, No 10 confirmed.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said Boris Johnson had been "emphatic that all of Europe needs to wean itself off use oil and gas and that's certainly something we are looking at now".

He said the Government was investigating whether two tankers carrying liquefied natural gas from Russia and due to dock in Kent at the weekend would be covered by the Transport Secretary's shipping ban.

But when asked whether it was still legal for a company to buy Russian gas if they could find a non-Russian ship to transport it, he said: "It is, and I think we recognise - and I think all European countries recognise - that we do need to move away from that.

"Clearly ending our oil and gas imports from Russia in silo and moving unilaterally could simply push up global gas prices further which effect UK citizens and that's not what we want to do."

Emergency powers may be needed to tackle the risk of asset flight ahead of sanctions being imposed by the UK following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Parliament has been told.

It follows calls by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer for Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich to face sanction. Mr Abramovich later announced he would sell the club, with the "net proceeds" going to a charity supporting victims of the war in Ukraine.

Speaking at Westminster, Labour frontbencher Lord Collins of Highbury said: "Speed is of the absolute essence here and we do need faster action and possibly emergency powers."

Responding, foreign minister Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon said: "I believe the Government has been responding and expediting legislation.

"I agree the issue of asset flight is an important consideration. That is why we are reluctant in announcing in advance particularly on individuals and organisations.

"There's clearly individuals, as we know, who are taking actions based on what's already happened. But equally we need to ensure that for every sanction that is imposed that it is legally robust and tested.

"That is an important part of our sanctions policy and with international partners."

The BBC is a "great British global brand" and it needs protecting, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has said.

Ms Dorries comments came as Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine highlighted the importance of the BBC World Service after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the use of the Russian language service tripling "to more than 10 million listeners".

The MP for Edinburgh West asked the Culture Secretary to assure the House the future funding of the BBC World Service "will be looked upon in the light of what has happened".

Ms Dorries replied: "As someone who ran a school in Africa for years, and listened and waited every day for the World Service to hear those words, announcing that the World Service... First of all, it is funded through the Foreign Office, not through my department, and we have always, I have always said that the BBC is a great British global brand, and it needs protecting.

"I've always said it was a polar bear on a shrinking ice cap. And we need to review the funding model in order to protect the BBC, and what is best at the BBC, which includes the World Service."

Downing Street said it was key that actions taken against Russia were those which put pressure on Vladimir Putin and his regime.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman was asked about steps such as the cancellation of the Trans-Siberian exhibition at the Science Museum, and whether those actions were going too far and hitting normal Russians.

He said: "We do want to be very clear with the Russian people, many of whom are incredibly bravely demonstrating on the streets of Russia, I think more than a million people signed a petition in Russia against the war, which is very brave given the authoritarian regime there. Our issue is not with the Russian people.

"We understand that... I'm sure that companies and businesses are trying to act in good faith here."

But he added: "I think what's important is to make sure that the actions that we take are done to exert pressure on Putin and his regime, rather than inflict any necessary pain on the Russian people."

Asked if Imperial Faberge eggs on loan to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London from the Kremlin should be kept in the UK until the conflict was resolved, the spokesman said he was "not aware of our position on Faberge eggs".

Ministers were called on to welcome Formula One's decision to cancel the Russian Grand Prix contract.

Conservative MP Bob Blackman (Harrow East) said: "I am sure she will join me in welcoming the decision by Formula One, which has only been made I think since she has been in the chamber, that not only are they cancelling the Formula One Grand Prix in Russia, they cancelled the contract with Russia and there won't be a future Grand Prix in Russia.

"Could she therefore also send a strong message out to the sporting world that these sanctions will continue to ratchet up until such time as Putin's government is no longer in power and the Russians are free then to choose their own leaders and return to the world of sport?"

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries replied that she would push for further international sporting action at a summit with other nations on Thursday afternoon.

She said: "We will not condone any organisation that hosts either sporting, cultural or creative events in Russia. We will campaign against that. We will push against it as much as we can.

"In sport in particular that is what the purpose of this afternoon's summit is, is to get to a position where not only is that our position and we are not just leading, but we are part of a wider coalition of ministers and countries who hold the same position."

No 10 said the Government had not been formally notified of the sale of Chelsea Football Club.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman was asked whether there were steps being taken to ensure Chelsea and Everton could continue to operate if their Russian owners were sanctioned.

He said: "It is early days on some of these things.

"As I say, we formally haven't had any notice on triggering the sale of Chelsea, which has been reported."

But he added: "We do have options available to us in extremis."

Venues which were due to host Russian-linked performances like ballet will "hopefully" be covered by insurance for cancellations, the Culture Secretary has said.

Independent MP Margaret Ferrier (Rutherglen and Hamilton West) said: "The House has heard frequently the financial difficulties facing the entertainment industry over the last two years and the Russian state ballet have had performances cancelled around the UK.

"Ticket-holders will be refunded by the venue. What support will the Government provide them so they are not out of pocket due to cancelled performances?"

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries replied: "The insurance of those individual organisations will hopefully kick in as a result because this is war.

"But what I would say is that at the moment we are focussed on - all of our efforts are focussed on - helping the people in Ukraine and helping to beat Putin."

A foreign minister has said the Government is "looking at the full picture" as he did not rule out stripping allies of Vladimir Putin living in the UK of their British citizenship.

But Tory frontbencher Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon pointed to the opposition of many Russians to the Kremlin following the invasion of Ukraine.

While highlighting the "significant action" taken by the Government on sanctions, Labour former minister Lord Foulkes of Cumnock said: "But there is one further sanction which has not yet been considered... and that is using the powers we have to remove British citizenship from Putin oligarch's living in the United Kingdom."

Lord Ahmad said: "We are looking at the full picture. But equally I would stress the point there are many Russians in the United Kingdom who are dual nationals, there are many Russians who don't have citizenship but who are residing in the UK, there are many Russians in Russia... who are totally and utterly against Mr Putin and his Government and it's important we stand by them as well."

Senior Tory MP Tobias Ellwood has added to calls for the UK to confiscate Russian oligarchs' assets before eventually returning their wealth to the Russian people.

The chairman of the Commons Defence Committee told the PA news agency: "We should leave no stone unturned in isolating these oligarchs from their investments including the seizure of properties and yachts.

"There's a race to squeeze Putin given the war crimes he's now committing in Ukraine and London continues to be seen as ground zero as to where oligarchs' investments sit. So we need to be impounding these assets in days, not weeks or months.

"There's going to be increasing public anger that we're not doing enough to help our fellow Ukrainians in their hour of need.

"I would agree with Tom (Tugendhat, fellow Tory MP), I simply would add what we do must be legally watertight what we can't see is any loopholes

"Every day we wait offers more time for the oligarchs to move their wealth to other parts of the world. Don't forget it's not their wealth, this is the stolen wealth from the Russian people which is utilised to keep Putin in power."

Marks & Spencer has announced it has suspended shipments to its Russian business run by the retailer's Turkish franchise holder.

"Given the unfolding humanitarian crisis following the invasion of Ukraine, M&S has suspended shipments to our Turkish franchisee's Russian business," the company said in a statement.

"We are doing everything we can to support the people of Ukraine, and in response to the growing refugee crisis we are building on our existing support for Unicef UK's Ukraine appeal with a £1.5 million package to support the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and Unicef to help children and families in need.

"This is made up of a kickstart £500,000 donation to UNHCR with a further £500,000 for matched fundraising for all our global colleagues and double donations on Sparks transactions to support Unicef, and activation of till-point and online giving in the UK.

"We are also providing practical help through UNHCR, donating 20,000 units of coats and thermals for families in need, totalling a further £500,000."

A group of NHS staff has launched an appeal to provide much-needed medical supplies to Ukraine.

Karolis Rozanas, from Lithuania, and a foundation year two doctor at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead, co-founded Medical Aid Ukraine North East with Katarzyna Kostrzewa, a surgical trainee with Health Education England North East.

Mr Rozanas and his wife, trainee psychiatrist Rugile Rozane, live in Whitley Bay after leaving the country that declared independence from Russia in 1990.

They set up the Medical Aid Ukraine North East Facebook page a few days ago, asking hospital trusts across the region for any medical, surgical or first aid supplies and medicines that are soon to expire or would be disposed of.

Mr Rozanas said: "What is going on in Ukraine is a brutal attack on everything we hold dear in the modern western world, with heartbreaking and devastating repercussions to innocent civilians.

"Field doctors from Ukraine, doing their best to care for people and save lives, are contacting us to ask for help. They are desperate for supplies. The worst thing we can do is be apathetic, stand by and do nothing."

Supplies are being collected by nine Medical Aid Ukraine hubs and will be transported to a central point and then on to Ukraine.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said "there is nowhere for any of Putin's cronies to hide" as she seeks to hit more Russian oligarchs with sanctions.

In an interview in Lithuania, she said: "We have to make sure we have the right evidence to put in place those sanctions.

"I'm very clear that legal threats will have no impact on our ability to sanction oligarchs and we will continue to work through our list, we will continue to sanction oligarchs and there is nowhere for any of Putin's cronies to hide."

Veteran Tory MP Sir Roger Gale has joined calls to seize Russian oligarchs' assets, saying "other countries are doing it better than we are".

Adding that the UK should move "hard and fast" with sanctions, Sir Roger told the PA news agency: "It does seem to me that you don't say we are going to punish you and give people however many days it is to move their assets.

"If you are going to do a drugs raid, you do a drugs raid. You go in the middle of the night and smash the door in, you don't say we're going to raid your house in 12 hours."

He added that he was "delighted" by reports that the Government was considering seizing oligarchs' assets without compensation and would support legislation to do so.

He said: "I think we have got to go down that road. I have some sympathy with the opposition position that we should be moving much faster."

Russia has accused the BBC of playing a "determined role in undermining the Russian stability and security".

Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova condemned the banning of Russian media RT and Sputnik, claiming the world was being deprived of Russia's point of view and that western media was only giving one side.

According to translation from RT, Ms Zakharova told a press briefing the only reason Russian journalists could still work in the UK was "related to London fears that (the) BBC might be targeted in Russia because it plays a determined role in undermining the Russian stability and security".

She said: "We haven't invented that because it stems from the statement by the British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss."

Downing Street said more sanctions will be imposed on Russia and people connected to the regime, "where we think it's right to do so".

A spokesman for the Prime Minister said there was an effort to "focus our efforts on those measures which have the biggest impact and exert the most pressure on President Putin's regime".

The spokesman said the Government would "obviously do everything we need to do to ensure that they withstand legal scrutiny".

He added that Downing Street supported individual companies taking action.

Asked about reports that the Co-op would stop selling Russian-made vodka, he said: "It's obviously up to individual companies in terms of the action they take but we obviously support those that have taken action.

"You've seen a range of companies as well as cultural organisations, sporting organisations, have made changes and we obviously support them in doing so."

Downing Street said it is "important" that the BBC can continue to do "the excellent work that they do".

Asked about comments by Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, a spokesman for the Prime Minister said: "Well, you know the PM's spoken before about the importance of an independent press and the fact that it's important that the BBC is editorially independent and can continue to do the excellent work that they do."

Speaking about any potential prosecution of Vladimir Putin for war crimes, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said: "He needs to know, and we need to send the message out to his commanders who could be faced with illegal orders to commit war crimes, that they will face, potentially, the dock of a court in The Hague, and prison.

"That's the deterrent message we want to send out. Just last year we had Karadzic come and spend time in a British cell.

"We're not going to take all of their criminals obviously, we've got a job to do here to house all the prisoners we're sentencing, but I think the UK has a role to play.

"We're sending the message out now that we will not just turn the other way, and however long it takes, if you commit a war crime on Ukrainian soil, expect to be held to account."

Asked if he would welcome seeing Vladimir Putin in a UK jail, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said: "Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

"We want to see Putin fail in Ukraine."

Pushed on whether there would be a space in a UK jail for the Russian president, Mr Raab said: "Look, we've done this before - Charles Taylor, (Radovan) Karadzic, if (Slobodan) Milosevic had survived he would have come to a high-security prison.

"Of course, I wouldn't want to prejudice any step of the legal process, but what I'm saying is with our allies around the world, particularly the ones that support the ICC (International Criminal Court)... we all need to work together to make sure there's a credible deterrent effect.

"We do that by supporting the court on anything from information, co-operation, witness relocation, forensics... and no-one has done more than the UK in that regard."

Asked if it was a case of "whatever it takes, the UK will do", Mr Raab added: "There's a team effort there and a process to go through which I wouldn't want to prejudice, but look at our track record, is what I'd say."

The Justice Secretary, who is a Chelsea fan, said he would not meet Roman Abramovich and the Russian-Israeli billionaire would have to "decide based on his own calculations" whether to make one final trip to Stamford Bridge.

Speaking to reporters, Dominic Raab said: "I've never met Mr Abramovich, and I wouldn't meet him.

"I think you've seen the response by many people to the sanctions regime we've got in place.

"But just to be clear, we don't comment on individual sanctions for very good reasons."

Asked if he thought Mr Abramovich going to Stamford Bridge for the final time would be a good idea, Mr Raab said: "He'll have to decide based on his own calculations."

Questioned on what he thought the fans would think of Mr Abramovich going to the stadium again, Mr Raab replied: "Not for me to say."

Mykhailo Podoliyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, tweeted: "The second round of negotiations is over. Unfortunately, the results Ukraine needs are not yet achieved. There is a solution only for the organization of humanitarian corridors."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: "Our message to Putin and his allies has been clear from day one - invading Ukraine would have serious and crippling economic consequences.

"Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war. We won't stop here. Our aim is to cripple the Russian economy and starve Putin's war machine."

The Foreign Office said Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov have been hit with full asset freezes and travel bans.

After the latest sanctions were announced, Boris Johnson said: "For as long as Putin continues his barbaric attack on innocent Ukrainians we will continue to exert every power we have to inflict maximum economic pain on Putin and his war machine."

Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt said: "Ukraine cannot be the price of our own security. It is absolutely in our interests as a country to have a free and sovereign Ukraine.

"(Vladimir) Putin's ambitions do not stop at Ukraine and Putin's war has to be finished on Ukrainian soil."

The former defence secretary told BBC's Question Time: "One of the most important things... we can do is send a message to Russian troops. It takes uncommon bravery not to follow an order and the orders that Russian troops are being given are criminal.

"These guys did not put on a uniform, they do not train hard to slaughter women and children.

"Our message to them should be: do the brave thing, as your comrades have done and put down your arms. Do not slaughter women and children."

BBC Russia says there have been reports there are problems accessing its website in Russia.

However, there has been no confirmation if the BBC has been banned by the Kremlin.

BBC Russia also said the domain https://bbc.com[https://bbc.com] has not been added to the registry of banned sites.

German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle reported, in Russian, that the BBC site was not working in Russia.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with Ukrainian President Zelensky after news broke about a fire at the nuclear power station in Zaporizhzhia.

A Downing Street spokeswoman called the situation "gravely concerning", adding: "Both leaders agreed that Russia must immediately cease its attack on the power station and allow unfettered access for emergency services to the plant.

"The Prime Minister said the reckless actions of President Putin could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe. He said the UK would do everything it could to ensure the situation did not deteriorate further.

"The Prime Minister said he would be seeking an emergency UN Security Council meeting in the coming hours, and that the UK would raise this issue immediately with Russia and close partners.

"Both leaders agreed a ceasefire was crucial."

The international community needs to "come down hard on Putin" after Russian forces shelled a nuclear power station in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, according to the Deputy Prime Minister.

Dominic Raab told Times Radio: "It is clearly reckless, irresponsible and not only the fact they were shooting, bombarding that particular site, but when the Ukrainian emergency authorities were trying to put out the fire, the shelling continued.

"It must stop.

"We support the Ukrainians in dealing with the security situation there but also I think come down hard on Vladimir Putin.

"That's why the Prime Minister has called for an emergency United Nations security council meeting in New York so the entire international community can address this, because of course it is a much wider threat, given the nuclear implications.

"It is an affront to the world at large."

Dominic Raab said it was "doubly reprehensible" that Russian forces had continued to shell a nuclear site after Ukrainian emergency services had looked to put a fire out at Europe's largest power station.

The Deputy Prime Minister told Sky News the Russians had inflicted a bombardment on a "very sensitive, precarious and dangerous facility" in Zaporizhzhia.

He said: "The fact that the Russians kept on bombarding after there was the fire and the Ukrainian emergency rescue team were trying to get to that makes it doubly reprehensible."

Mr Raab said the UN security council meeting being called for by Boris Johnson was needed to "ramp up the pressure on these appalling tactics we are seeing from the Kremlin".

(Corrected repetition: Changes 'voted for' in par six to 'taken')

Latvia's foreign minister has said Nato should "consider all options" when asked about entering direct conflict with Russia.

Edgars Rinkevics told the BBC's Today programme that governments "should not exclude" any recourse to stop the invasion.

Earlier, the programme heard from former Ukrainian prime minister Oleksiy Honcharuk, who said other European countries "don't understand" the lengths Putin will go to.

He said leaders from other countries should offer direct military support and "at least to close our skies to protect us from the threat".

Asked about the comments, Mr Rinkevics said: "I think we should consider all options but we should also understand, let's say, some Nato policies can be implemented only if those countries that have necessary assets agree on that."

He added that any decision would have to be taken unanimously.

Asked whether Nato may instead be forced to broker an "uncomfortable" settlement with Russia, the minister replied: "Well, I think we must do everything that we can. That's why I'm saying that we should not exclude any options."

The UK is "at the vanguard" of imposing sanctions on Kremlin-linked money, according to the Deputy Prime Minister, as he sought to defend the Government's actions on targeting Russian oligarchs.

Dominic Raab was asked during broadcast interviews why the European Union had sanctioned more individual Russian elites than Britain.

Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Dominic Raab said it was a "false distinction" to make, adding: "The question is not whether it is individuals or companies - it is where the money is flowing."

Separately, he said: "There has been a running commentary that the UK has somehow been slow - we've not been slow.

"We've been at the vanguard of taking action and, of course, what is really important is we act in concert with our allies, European, American and other Nato allies.

"For example, we have sanctioned more Russian banks than the EU, including Sberbank, which is the biggest Russian bank. We've made it clear and introduced measures so that three million Russian companies cannot raise loans or get listed on the UK stock market.

"These measures - and each country has slightly different sanctions regimes - are all aimed at tightening the noose, if you like, and starving off the finance that is going into Putin's war machine."

The Deputy Prime Minister said he would support giving over seized Russian oligarch property in the UK to Ukrainian refugees.

Asked on LBC whether Britain could capture property assets owned by Russian elites in punishment for Moscow's invasion on Ukraine, Dominic Raab said: "Yeah, if we've got the evidence and the legal basis, then we'll do it."

Pressed on whether he would back using those properties to house Ukrainian refugees - a move called for by the Liberal Democrats and reportedly argued for in Government by Housing Secretary Michael Gove - Mr Raab replied: "Yes, absolutely.

"We are looking at everything in the round, it is a team effort across Government, from the foreign and defence secretary through to Michael Gove and, of course, the Prime Minister is driving this very hard."

Vladimir Putin is "at risk" of ending up in prison for war crimes carried out by his Russian forces in Ukraine, the Justice Secretary said.

Dominic Raab, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, was asked on Times Radio whether he saw the conflict ending with the Russian president "imprisoned for war crimes".

He said: "I think it is a very real risk that he must now contemplate.

"Beyond his personal situation, every commander operating in Ukraine, or indeed Moscow, when they are faced with illegal orders, whether it is to target civilians or otherwise, attack illegal or unlawful sites, they now know the ICC (international criminal court ) is investigating and the chief prosecutor Karim Khan is, I believe, travelling to Ukraine.

"They must now know that they face the very real risk of ending up in the dock of a court and, ultimately, in a prison if they follow through on those illegal, unlawful orders."

The Welsh Government is to provide £4 million in aid to Ukraine.

First Minister Mark Drakeford, who told Sky News that Wales hopes to be "a nation of sanctuary" for Ukrainian refugees, said the aid would help people on the front line.

He told the programme: "We know that cash is what is really needed here and now on the ground for people who can obtain those goods and put that money to good use - and that is why the £4 million from the Welsh Government will go to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal that we launched here in Wales yesterday."

He could not say how many refugees that Wales could be dealing with and that many of them might like to stay near family or friends who may live elsewhere.

He said: "What we would like to see through the UK Government is a simple, fast, safe and legal route for those needing to seek sanctuary elsewhere in the world and in Wales to be able to come here.

"For those people for whom Wales could be even a temporary home, a temporary place of sanctuary, we will want to do everything we can to welcome them and to provide for them."

Justice Secretary Dominic Raab is looking to change the law to prevent Russian oligarchs and kleptocrats from exploiting the British justice system to "silence" those investigating corruption linked to Vladimir Putin's regime.

The Cabinet minister told BBC Breakfast: "There is another aspect to this that I'm looking at as a matter of urgency and will be producing proposals on very shortly.

"We have seen oligarchs and kleptocrats and those with links to Putin coming into this country and suing under our libel laws those who are shining a light, whether it is authors or NGOs, on corruption and abuse.

"And that is an abuse of our system and I'm going to be putting forward proposals to deal with that and to prevent that.

"It cannot be right that kleptocrats and those with links to Putin can silence those shining a light on those excesses and use our courts to do so."

The UK has got to "stop dragging" its feet in clamping down on funds that have come from figures linked to Russia President Vladimir Putin, Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds has said.

She told Sky News: "I certainly would say that we have been far too soft, especially over the last 10 years, on those funds that have come from Putin-linked oligarchs and business people."

She rejected the Government's claims that it has been working strongly against economic levers for Putin-linked individuals.

She said: "I have got to say that, for many, many years, Labour has been calling on the Conservatives to, for example, force transparency around property ownership, especially in London where we know that many of these Putin-linked oligarchs have been stashing their funds in property.

"We see, even with the new measures that finally have been extracted from the Government now that they say they will announce on Monday, an 18-month window before they will come into action - that's just not good enough.

"We need immediate action now. We can put those registers of foreign-owned property into place in 28 days, we believe we could get those running and force that transparency.

"We should have had it many years ago but, above all, we need it right now. We have got to act right now and we have got to stop dragging our feet as the Conservative Government has been doing."

Dominic Raab said he would not comment on individuals after being asked about the circumstances of the sale of Chelsea football club and the potential for owner Roman Abramovich to profit.

Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether Mr Abramovich should be able to do "what he wants to" with the proceeds of the sale, the Deputy Prime Minister said: "I'm not going to talk about individual sanctions on individuals."

Pressed on the case of Mr Abramovich and the sale of his Premier League club, Mr Raab said: "We don't talk about individual cases before the sanctions are imposed.

"We have overnight imposed sanctions on Mr (Alisher) Usmanov and (Igor) Shuvalov, but the reason we do it is, first of all, precisely because it is contested and, as Justice Secretary, I can't prejudge these things.

"But, more importantly, we do not want to give advance sight to anyone of the measures that we take."

The West must be prepared for Russian President Vladimir Putin's tactics in Ukraine to become "ever more barbaric", a Cabinet minister has warned.

Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the economic sanctions taken on Russia are "starting to bite" but that Britain and its allies need to "bed in and have the strategic stamina for the long haul".

He added: "I've said that we can expect that, after the stuttering start to this campaign, that Putin would resort to ever more barbaric measures as he gets frustrated.

"And that is the next phase that we all need to be alert to, whether it is the sanctions or the steeling of the capacity and the will of the Ukrainian defence."

In response to the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, a Nuclear Industry Association spokesman said: "We condemn in the strongest possible terms the Russian military attacks around the Zaporizhzhia plant that have endangered the lives of nuclear workers bravely discharging their duties.

"We commend the extraordinary dedication of the station's staff and operators in what are terrible circumstances, and emphatically endorse the IAEA's call for a halt to all use of force around Ukraine's nuclear power plants.

"We understand that the fire at the plant was not in the reactor buildings, has been extinguished and has not affected essential equipment, with no reported change in radiation levels."

The BBC said it will continue efforts to make sure people in Russia have access to its news output following reports that its Russian Service website has been blocked in the country.

A BBC spokesman said: "Access to accurate, independent information is a fundamental human right which should not be denied to the people of Russia, millions of whom rely on BBC News every week. We will continue our efforts to make BBC News available in Russia, and across the rest of the world."

The broadcaster previously said the audience for its Russian language news website has more than tripled its year-to-date weekly average to a record 10.7 million people in the last week, while visitors to the English language bbc.com in Russia were up 252% to 423,000 last week.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the overnight attack on a nuclear plant in Ukraine as "deeply alarming".

Speaking during a visit to Birmingham, Sir Keir said: "I think the whole world will be shocked. I think it's very important that we unite now and renew that message that Russia must withdraw.

"We need a ceasefire - and we need to stop this aggression from Russia because this escalation is deeply, deeply concerning."

Asked how Nato and western governments could stop the escalating attacks on Ukraine, Sir Keir Starmer said: "We need the retreat from the Russian aggression in Ukraine - it's as simple as that.

"Every day we are seeing these attacks and the devastation that they are bringing about."

Sir Keir said of President Putin: "From what I've already seen, it seems to me there is evidence of war crimes and it's very important that all of those responsible are held to account.

"What's really important now is the gathering of evidence to make sure that the most powerful case can be brought whenever it can be brought."

Asked for his view of the UK Government's efforts to sanction Russian oligarchs, Sir Keir Starmer said: "Where the Government is taking action on sanctions, we support them. But they have got to go further and faster.

"We must go after every oligarch. This is the weapon we have to use and we need to use it now.

"I am particularly concerned about the arrangements where the Government is suggesting there could be 18 months for those overseas owners to register their assets and their ownership.

"That gives them 18 months to remove their assets from this country, so I want to see the Government move on this."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK Government is doing "all we can to support the Ukrainians".

Speaking in Brussels, Ms Truss said she was holding various meetings to show "the strength of our unity in challenging Vladimir Putin, in stopping Vladimir Putin, in Ukraine".

"We're doing all we can to support the Ukrainians through defensive weapons, where the UK led - we were the first European country to donate defensive weapons, and we're also going to be talking about sanctions."

She said sanctions were having a "big effect in Russia" but she said she was looking at how to speed up the process.

"We've sanctioned more companies than our counterparts across the world, we've just sanctioned two more major oligarchs last night," she said.

"What I'm doing is looking how we can speed up that process to make even more progress on that front.

"The number one thing (that's) important though, is that we are unified with our partners across the world in putting the toughest ever sanctions we've had on Russia."

Sir Keir Starmer has said Labour wanted to see a rule brought in to force oligarchs to register assets over a "very, very short" period measured in days.

The Labour leader said: "Otherwise what will happen - it's inevitable - is that people will remove their assets... they will remove and sell their properties in the UK, and put the money somewhere else.

"This is the powerful weapon we have to support Ukraine. We've got to use it.

"I say to the Government - get rid of the 18-month timeline. Bring it down to a number of days and we will vote it through on Monday.

"The strongest provisions, we will be united in voting through. But I don't want to see the Government slowing down here or losing the ambition to take that opportunity."

Sir Keir Starmer said it was clear Ukraine wanted the strongest possible response from Nato members, adding that the people of the country were "bravely" fighting back.

Asked for his view of President Vladimir Putin's state of mind and the way he was acting, Sir Keir answered: "Putin is a dangerous aggressor who is in breach of international law.

"I think he is gambling that Ukraine and our allies, the United Kingdom and Nato would not be united. He will be surprised by how united we are."

Sir Keir Starmer called for Conservative fundraiser and co-chair Ben Elliot to be sacked for his role in links between the Tories and Russian money.

Speaking during a visit to Birmingham Erdington, Sir Keir said: "I think there is growing concern about the links between the Conservative Party and Russian money.

"Ben Elliot is at the heart of that. We need to strip Russian money away from our politics, not to allow it to influence our politics.

"There will always be this danger if the Conservative government doesn't go really hard on this that people will say it must be because you are reliant on Russian money that you are not going more quickly.

"So, it's in everybody's best interests that Ben Elliot steps back from his role - and I think he should actually be sacked from it."

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has spoken of "numerous cases" of rapes in his country as the Russian invasion continues.

Welcoming a call to create a special tribunal to punish Vladimir Putin for the crime of aggression against Ukraine, he said it was "difficult" to talk about international law amid the country's current suffering.

He told an online event organised by the Chatham House think-tank: "When bombs fall on your cities, when soldiers rape women in the occupied cities - and we have numerous cases of, unfortunately, when Russian soldiers rape women in Ukrainian cities - it's difficult of course to speak about the efficiency of the international law.

"This is the only tool of civilisation that is available to us to make sure that, in the end, eventually, all those who made this war possible will be brought to justice and the Russian Federation, as a country that committed an act of aggression, will also be held accountable for its deeds."

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba called on the media to "spread the truth about Russia's crimes against Ukraine".

He thanked people for their continued support, saying: "I appreciate that all of you stand by Ukraine."

He told those listening to an online event organised by the Chatham House think-tank: "We are fighting against the enemy who is much stronger than us.

"But international law is on our side, and hopefully it will help us, it will make its own contribution, to help us prevail."

On the issue of Russian money being laundered in London, the city's mayor Sadiq Khan told PA: "It is quite clear that many people across the globe, including in Russia, see London as the money laundering capital of the world. That's unacceptable.

"So, we're lobbying the Government to be seizing the assets of those Russian oligarchs who are close to Putin, to be making sure that the sanctions are implemented, it's really important to do so.

"But also to urgently make public a list of all those properties in our city that are owned by those who are from overseas."

He added: "We've already had more than a week since the Russians invaded Ukraine, and no real movement from the Government, no real action. They've got to step up.

"Other countries in the European Union can be seizing multi-million pound yachts. Why can't we?"

Supermarket chain Sainsbury's will stop selling all products that come from Russia and change the name of Chicken Kievs to Chicken Kyiv to match the Ukrainian spelling of the capital city.

The company said that it would be removing Russian Standard vodka and Karpayskiye black sunflower seeds from its shelves.

But it will continue to sell JJ Whitley products after the manufacturer said it plans to move all production to Chorley in the UK.

"We stand united with the people of Ukraine. We have reviewed our product range and have decided to remove from sale all products that are 100% sourced from Russia," the supermarket said.

Boris Johnson does not back calls for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be assassinated, No 10 said.

A spokesman for the Prime Minister was asked about comments made by US Senator Lindsey Graham urging Russians to kill their leader.

Asked if the PM agreed, the spokesman said: "No, we stand with the Ukrainian people in demanding the immediate end to the Russian invasion.

"We've said before that Putin must be held (to) account in front of an international court for the horrific act he's committed."

Former prime minister Gordon Brown criticised Russia for not making a statement regarding safety on the nuclear power station in south-eastern Ukraine it has taken control of, saying that is a "failure to respond to the pleas of the international community".

He told an online event organised by the Chatham House think-tank: "I am surprised that this morning, now that the Russian government have taken over a second nuclear power station in Ukraine, and now are in control of it, they have not made a statement that they will not allow that nuclear station to be used to endanger and to threaten human life.

"It is these very instances of Russia's failure to respond to the pleas of the international community, that make us determined that we will step up our campaign to make sure that Russia is brought to justice for what is a crime of aggression but of course could - and I support the International Criminal Court's actions - be in other areas too."

Boris Johnson is concerned for the safety of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Downing Street said.

The Prime Minister has regularly spoken to the Ukrainian leader and has expressed his personal admiration of him and a spokesman for the PM was asked whether Mr Johnson was worried about attempts reportedly made on Mr Zelensky's life.

He said: "Of course, everybody's concerned for the safety and welfare of the President of Ukraine and the rest of the government, as well as the people of Ukraine who we've seen indiscriminately targeted over recent days."

The Defence Secretary said the shared values of the West were "under threat" from Russian president Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking in Copenhagen, Denmark, where he is visiting allies in the UK Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF), Ben Wallace said Mr Putin was "bombarding, ordering the killing, invasion of a sovereign country for simply having the nerve to choose a different future for itself".

The Cabinet minister said there were fears that a "new Cold War, a new Iron Curtain will descend upon Europe".

He added: "Now is the time for us to stand together in common values and in determination, both in soft and hard power.

"We recognise that freedom isn't free."

Mr Wallace was speaking on board a ship that was preparing to deliver Danish forces to serve alongside British troops in Estonia, which he said would "send a common message to President Putin that we are all together, whether you are in Nato or not, joined at the hip by our values".

Priti Patel has said Ukrainians fleeing into Poland were escaping "the most atrocious set of circumstances where they are being persecuted by President Putin".

Speaking on a visit to the Polish border, the Home Secretary told reporters she was in the country "very much in terms of standing in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, but also with our friends here in Poland".

She said she wanted to "to see the work that they're doing and also to see how we can support Poland much more in terms of helping those Ukrainians with links to the United Kingdom to come to Britain, and actually we've been discussing some of that work here today".

Ms Patel said: "We're also launching our new family extension route today to enable Ukrainian families with links to the UK to come over to Britain. That scheme is live, that is now working, that's up and running.

"We stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Ukraine but also with our dear friends here in Poland, who are working really night and day, we can all see this, under incredible circumstances."

The Disasters Emergency Committee's (DEC) Ukraine appeal has raised £55 million in its first day.

The total includes "generous" donations from the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, DEC said.

It said hundreds of thousands of members of the public donated to the humanitarian appeal within hours of its launch on Thursday.

The total includes £20 million donated by the UK Government as part of its UK Aid Match scheme - the largest commitment ever made to a DEC appeal through the initiative.

DEC chief executive Saleh Saeed said the committee is "extremely grateful" for the "huge generosity" of everyone who has donated to the appeal, adding: "We are also very grateful for the generous support of the royal family."

He said: "We also thank the UK Government who have matched pound for pound the first £20 million donated by the public, as well as our broadcast partners and celebrities for having aired and joined the appeal, reaching millions of viewers and listeners.

"Giving through the DEC is the most effective way to get the right assistance to the right people. While wanting to collect clothes and other items for people in need is laudable, the things people give today may not be what people need tomorrow and aid workers say they can't use much of what is arriving. Donating through the DEC is the most helpful way people can assist.

"While we have raised an astonishing amount in the first day of the appeal, we urge people to continue donating as the need is great and the response needed is likely to run into months and years. Please help now."

Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic about the situation in Ukraine on Friday afternoon.

The pair "reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine's territorial integrity", while Mr Johnson said the UK would "continue to support Serbia's efforts to promote stability in the wider region", a Downing Street spokesperson said.

"The leaders agreed to continue to work together on a range of issues, including across the energy sector," the spokesperson added.

"President Vucic thanked the Prime Minister for the UK's leading role during this time of crisis."

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Russia's invasion of Ukraine is "an attack on our freedoms, our values and the security of Europe".

In a statement issued after a meeting with defence ministers from the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) nations, Mr Wallace said Russian President Vladimir Putin has "sought to break our defensive alliances, which is why now, more than at any point in the history of the JEF, our partnership is so vital".

He added: "We are united in our resolve across the JEF nations to support Ukraine. Our values are Ukraine's values and we will continue to provide lethal and non-lethal aid, alongside sending additional forces to Estonia serving with our Danish allies."

The BBC will "temporarily suspend" the work of all its BBC News journalists and support staff in Russia following new legislation passed by the Russian authorities.

BBC director-general Tim Davie said: "This legislation appears to criminalise the process of independent journalism. It leaves us no other option than to temporarily suspend the work of all BBC News journalists and their support staff within the Russian Federation while we assess the full implications of this unwelcome development.

"Our BBC News service in Russian will continue to operate from outside Russia.

"The safety of our staff is paramount and we are not prepared to expose them to the risk of criminal prosecution simply for doing their jobs. I'd like to pay tribute to all of them, for their bravery, determination and professionalism.

"We remain committed to making accurate, independent information available to audiences around the world, including the millions of Russians who use our news services. Our journalists in Ukraine and around the world will continue to report on the invasion of Ukraine."

The importance of the "total international condemnation of Russia's barbaric actions" has been agreed between Boris Johnson and Turkish President Recep Erdogan in a phone call on Friday afternoon.

A Downing Street spokesperson said the pair had spoken and that: "They agreed on the powerful message sent by the UN General Assembly earlier this week in opposition to the Russian invasion."

"The leaders discussed the need to continue supporting the people of Ukraine in their resistance against Russian aggression," the spokesperson said.

"The Prime Minister outlined the steps the UK has taken to isolate Russia both militarily and economically.

"Both the Prime Minister and President Erdogan highlighted the immediate need for Russia to provide urgent humanitarian access to Ukraine.

"They agreed to stay in close contact in the coming days as part of the co-ordinated Nato and international response."

The Metropolitan Police said the War Crimes Team is part of Counter Terrorism Command and has "national responsibility for carrying out any UK enquiries into war crimes and core international crimes".

Detectives are appealing for anyone in the UK who may have direct evidence of war crimes in Ukraine from 21 November 2013 onwards to come forward, and are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed or been the victim of any war crimes in Ukraine during this period.

Evidence given to and gathered by the War Crimes Team may then be shared with the International Criminal Court to assist with their investigation.

Commander Richard Smith, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, which includes the War Crimes Team said: "Following the news that the ICC (International Criminal Court) had opened an investigation into war crimes in Ukraine, our War Crimes Team is now seeking to gather any evidence that might be present here in the UK of such crimes in Ukraine.

"This could be in the form of direct messages, images or videos that friends or relatives here in the UK have been sent by those in Ukraine.

"Or it could be somebody who was previously in Ukraine and who may have witnessed or even been a victim of a war crime and has since travelled to the UK.

"To be clear though, we specifically want to hear from people who are now here in the UK, and who have a direct link to any relevant information or evidence - this is not about the general public highlighting or telling us about things they might have simply come across or seen in the media, online or on social media."

The UK permanent representative to the United Nations said Russia "must keep fighting away from and protect the safety and security of nuclear sites".

Dame Barbara Woodward said it was a relief that reports so far suggested there had been "no release of radioactive material" following Russia's shelling of a nuclear power station in Ukraine, but such an attack "must not happen again".

Addressing the UN Security Council, she said: "Colleagues, this is the first time that a state has attacked a fuelled and functioning nuclear power plant.

"International law requires special protection for nuclear facilities. And it is difficult to see how Russia's actions were compatible with its commitments under Article 56 of the additional protocol of the (Geneva) Conventions. It must not happen again.

"Even in the midst of an illegal invasion of Ukraine, Russia must keep fighting away from and protect the safety and security of nuclear sites."

Dame Barbara Woodward said Russian President Vladimir Putin had "misjudged the strength, resilience and will of the Ukrainian people".

Addressing the UN Security Council, the UK permanent representative to the United Nations said: "President Putin said yesterday that the special military operation, or as everyone else calls it, the war, was going to plan. Everyone around this table knows that is not true.

"President Putin misjudged the strength, resilience and will of the Ukrainian people to his invasion.

"He underestimated the world's condemnation of his actions - 141 votes in the General Assembly and the unprecedented sanctions on Russia demonstrate the strength of the global response.

"Every day, this war continues the destruction it brings to Ukraine, the suffering it inflicts on Ukrainian and Russian people, and the risks it poses to international peace and security increase.

"This must stop. We call on Russia to end this violence, withdraw its troops and enter into serious peace negotiations."

A former British ambassador to Russia said he suspects the next few days of the Ukraine crisis will be "pretty grisly".

Sir Roderic Lyne, who held the post from 2000 to 2004, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: "(Russian President Vladimir) Putin is working towards the moment when he can say 'mission accomplished', and claim to his own people that he has secured a great victory in what he denies is a war or an invasion, and calls a special military operation.

"And I do not see him turning back from that objective until he reaches a point where he can say that."

The Government has put forward a series of amendments to the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Bill to "crack down on corrupt elites" and put pressure on Russia, the Foreign Office said.

The FCDO said changes will allow the UK to align more rapidly with the individual designations imposed by allies such as the US, Canada and the EU via an urgent designation procedure.

The amendments will remove the test of 'appropriateness' for designations, enabling the government to act more quickly and make changes to further facilitate the designations of groups of individuals.

The Government has also brought forward amendments to shorten the deadline for overseas companies to register their beneficial owners from 18 months to six months, aiming to crack down on money laundering through UK property.

A further amendment will also increase criminal penalties for non-compliance from fines of up to £500 per day to up to £2,500 per day.

Boris Johnson said the changes to the legislation would give the UK "new powers in our arsenal to go further and faster" in sanctioning Vladimir Putin's regime.

He said: "The UK has led the way with the toughest package of sanctions against Putin's regime and we're bolstering this with new powers in our arsenal to go further and faster.

"We will ramp up the pressure on those criminal elites trying to launder money on UK soil and close the net on corruption. They will have nowhere to hide."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss added: "Our message to Putin and his cronies has been clear from day one - invading Ukraine would have serious and crippling consequences. We have been true to our word, introducing the largest and strongest sanctions package in our history, but we are not stopping here.

"The changes we are making will allow us to go faster and harder on those closest to Putin, including oligarchs, as we continue to ratchet pressure in the face of illegal and unprovoked Russian aggression."

Amendments to the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Bill will be expedited through all its Commons stages on Monday.

Russia has blocked access to Facebook, according to the country's state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor.

In a statement, the regulator said: "On March 4, 2022, a decision was made to block access to the Facebook network (owned by Meta Platforms, Inc) in the Russian Federation.

"Since October 2020, 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media and information resources by Facebook have been recorded.

"In recent days, the social network has restricted access to accounts: the Zvezda TV channel, the RIA Novosti news agency, Sputnik, Russia Today, the Lenta.ru and Gazeta.ru information resources."

It comes a week after Russia limited access to Facebook after the social media provider refused to stop fact-checking and labelling content from state-owned organisations.

Sir Nick Clegg, vice president of global affairs at Facebook's parent company Meta, said of the decision: "Soon millions of ordinary Russians will find themselves cut off from reliable information, deprived of their everyday ways of connecting with family and friends and silenced from speaking out.

"We will continue to do everything we can to restore our services so they remain available to people to safely and securely express themselves and organise for action."

Boris Johnson spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron about the "appalling situation in Ukraine" on Friday evening.

The Prime Minister described it as "the worst war on our continent for a long time", while both leaders agreed "the reckless actions leading to damage to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant were despicable", to a Downing Street spokesperson said.

The leaders were said to have agreed it is "imperative" both countries continue to do all they can to help the Ukrainian people, "including via further humanitarian support - as well as economically and militarily".

"Both leaders reiterated the UK and France would work closely in the coming days in the face of Putin's increasingly savage and evil actions," the spokesperson added.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted a message in Ukrainian on Friday night that read: "I want to address Ukrainians directly here in the UK and those in Ukraine and neighbouring countries."

In a video clip underneath he said: "I cannot even imagine what you're living through right now, or the outrage and heartbreak you must feel as everything you know and love is so inexplicably and brutally shattered.

"What's happening in your homeland is an abomination, and like people across the UK, I am heartsick at the destruction and loss of life.

"On Wednesday, MPs in our House of Commons stood to applaud the Ukrainian ambassador and to demonstrate that the whole of the UK stands squarely with the people of Ukraine, and your awe-inspiring struggle against this aggression.

"Together, with Ukraine's many friends, we're doing everything we can to support you and to impose a mountain of pressure on Vladimir Putin.

"We're working with more than 25 allies and partners from as far away as Australia to support those engaged in the battle, not only to protect their homes, but freedom and democracy itself.

"With the US and the European Union, we've brought in the biggest package of global sanctions ever imposed on Russia. And we will go further, unless and until this aggression stops."

Boris Johnson added in his video message: "The world is turning its back on Putin and his regime.

"Global corporations are severing ties with Russia. Participation in sporting events is being cancelled, and nation after nation is taking a stand.

"The vice is tightening its grip, and it will continue to tighten.

"To those Ukrainians here in the UK, who I know are desperately worried about family and friends, I can tell you we're doing everything we can to help those fleeing the conflict. If you're a Ukrainian in the UK, we've made it easier for you to bring over family members through the Ukrainian Family Scheme.

"On Tuesday, I announced there will be a new humanitarian sponsorship route, and we're matching the donations you make through the Disasters Emergency Committee Ukraine appeal, starting with £20 million, alongside the hundreds of millions were providing in humanitarian aid.

"Putin has made a grave miscalculation. The free world is united in its resolve to stand up to his barbarism, and the fortitude and defiance of the Ukrainian people in the face of this unjust and unwarranted aggression is moving hearts around the world.

"I've spoken almost every day to President Volodymyr Zelensky, and I marvelled at his bravery, his calm, his sense of purpose, just as I marvel at the heroism and resolve of the Ukrainian people.

"And I know that however long it takes, however arduous, Putin must fail. Our thoughts and our sympathies are with the whole of Ukraine in its battle for freedom."

Ukrainian forces have "proved a far tougher prospect than Putin expected", Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has said.

Giving an update on the situation in Ukraine on Trevor Phillips On Sunday on Sky News, Mr Raab said Russian troops were taking a morale hit.

He said economic sanctions had "put the squeeze on Putin" and therefore "what he's now doing is responding with evermore brutal tactics".

"I think the bottom line is none of the major cities have yet fallen," he said.

"I think we ought to be under no doubt that our mission with our allies is to ensure Putin fails in Ukraine, and it's going to take some time.

"We're talking about months, if not years, and therefore we will have to show some strategic stamina because this is not going to be over in days."

Dominic Raab has warned Russian commanders and those around Vladimir Putin that they also risked being prosecuted for war crimes at the International Criminal Court (ICC).

Justice Secretary Mr Raab said the "reckless and frankly applying tactics by the Putin regime must be held to account".

He told Trevor Phillips On Sunday on Sky News this applied "not just (to) Putin himself, but also anyone taking illegal orders".

"My point, the here and now in all of this, is I want, and we want, and the ICC is making clear, that for all of those commanders on the ground right through to the people around Putin in the Kremlin, what they do now, whether they give or whether they follow illegal orders to commit war crimes, they will be held to account for it, and they need to know that."

Dominic Raab again ruled out imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying this would lead to a "massive escalation" and would feed into the Russian president's narrative.

He told Sky News's Trevor Phillips on Sunday programme: "We're not going to get ourselves into a direct military conflict with Putin because that would be a massive escalation, but also that feeds Putin's narrative.

"Putin wants to say that he's actually in a struggle with the west - he's not".

He called no-fly zones "very difficult, very challenging" and said "we will do everything short of that to support Ukrainians".

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said his party supports the Government but he wants to see them going "further and faster".

Sir Keir told ITV News: "Everybody understands why we can't have a no-fly zone, why direct military assistance is not possible. That means sanctions have to be the strongest we have ever seen, the most effective we've ever seen. And in order for sanctions to work, you need to know what property the oligarchs have got here in the United Kingdom.

"At the moment, the Government is saying that they will have to register that ownership but they'll have six months to do that. Now, our concern is that in that six months, there's time to sell property and therefore it'll never be registered, never be sanctioned.

"That should be 28 days. So, I want to push the Prime Minister much further than that and we'll be trying to do that tomorrow."

Sir Keir said there is also another area where the Government could move.

He added: "That is in relation to those oligarchs who have been using our courts to suppress critics and challenges, expensive legal cases that close down challenge and free speech.

"We want to see the Government go much further there. There's going to be an amendment tomorrow in Parliament."

The Labour leader added: "So, yes, we support what the Government is doing, but we do think they could go further and faster, and we are going to be pushing them to do that tomorrow on that issue."

Sir Keir Starmer has said there is a bit of "frustration" in relation to the Economic Crime Bill as "these issues are not new".

He told ITV News: "There's a bit of frustration there, I have to say, because these issues are not new.

"There was something called the Russia report of two years ago now that pointed out why we needed some of these measures and the Government hasn't acted quickly enough. So, there's a frustration.

"I am determined that that frustration doesn't lead to division because I think that Putin wants to see us divided and we're not going to let him see us divided. We're going to be united standing up to Russian aggression."

Dominic Raab has defied Vladimir Putin's claim that the sanctions levelled against him and Russia were a declaration of war.

The Deputy Prime Minister told Trevor Phillips on Sky News: "Just to be clear, sanctions are not an act of war, international law (is) very clear about that.

"Our sanctions are entirely both legally justified but also proportionate to what we're trying to deal with."

Mr Raab said he thought Mr Putin's nuclear posturing was "rhetoric and brinkmanship", and accused the Russian leader of having "a track record as long as anyone's arm of misinformation and propaganda".

He added: "This is a distraction from what the real issues are at hand, which is that it's an illegal invasion and it is not going according to plan."

Mr Raab also called on China and India to take a more active role to put on diplomatic pressure.

Shadow defence secretary John Healey has said a no-fly zone over Ukraine would give the Russian president a "get-out-of-jail-free card".

He told Trevor Phillips On Sunday on Sky News: "Nato has ruled it out and the most essential thing is that the western alliance remains together.

"The big risk is that it gives Putin the grounds to rapidly escalate this conflict and, of course, it gives him the get-out-of-jail-free card to explain to his own people why his military campaign, his invasion in Ukraine, is not going well."

He also said: "The hard fact is Ukraine is not a member of Nato.

"The best thing that Britain and western countries can do at the moment is step up the military assistance as we have been doing to help Ukrainians defend themselves."

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said it is "very important" the public have trust in their leaders when asked about whether it is the right time to put pressure on the Prime Minister over partygate allegations.

Sir Keir told ITV News: "In a time like this, it's very important that the public have trust in their leaders. But I can tell you in the debate in Parliament tomorrow, we won't be talking about partygate.

"We will be absolutely focused on the amendments that we need to pass to toughen up the sanctions regime. So, our challenge to the Government tomorrow is to go further and to go faster on this."

Shadow defence secretary John Healey emphasised the importance of finding a "negotiated solution" and of western countries pushing the Russian president to de-escalate.

He said Vladimir Putin's record in Chechnya, Syria and his attacks on Russian citizens on foreign soil showed "how dangerous this man is".

"At the heart of this war is the danger of escalation and the discipline and unity from Nato and from the west in putting in tough sanctions, and making sure that we reinforce our Nato eastern flank, but saying to Putin 'everything now depends on you being willing to negotiate and to start to de-escalate'.

"It's Putin who's escalating and it's Putin who must de-escalate if we're going to find a way through this war."

Putin's actions "should redouble our determination to support the Ukrainian resistance but also to try and find a negotiated solution as we remain united as a western alliance," he said.

On sanctioning Russians in the UK, shadow defence secretary John Healey said the Government's legislation to impose sanctions "has been faulty and flawed for too long".

He said: "This Economic Crime Bill is important - it will give us some of the legislative and economic weapons we don't yet have, but it need toughening up."

The Labour MP also said he expected to see a "big boost to defence" in the Budget.

"The Government must respond to increased threats and increased threats to our security in Europe".

Dominic Raab has said the Government will be reforming libel laws in order to stop Russian oligarchs using Britain's court system.

He told ITV News: "I've already made clear we're going to reform our libel laws. I'm going to bring forward proposals to do so.

"What we've seen, and we've seen it in relation to journalists, academics, authors, the kleptocrats and those who are linked to Putin and deep pockets, come to this country, use our jurisdiction to sue those who are shining light on corruption or the excesses of the Putin regime. That cannot be right.

"We will not tolerate it and are going to bring forward proposals, and we very much hope the Labour Party will back them."

Specifically on the proposals, the Deputy Prime Minister added: "They could deal with anything from allocation of costs, so that you don't find all those on relatively modest salaries against the might of an oligarchy with very deep pockets. And basically find themselves bankrupted.

"We could look at the threshold for defamation in those kinds of cases, the US operates a different threshold. Those are things to look through quite carefully and we'll be bringing forward those proposals quite shortly."

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna has said the situation in her country was getting "more and more severe".

Ms Stefanishyna told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme that Russian forces were shelling hospitals, nurseries and schools, and civilian homes.

She said: "This is how the reality looks but it seems like ... it does not look like (it is on) the agenda for the new wave of sanctions to be introduced by the democratic world."

Ms Stefanishyna said the situation reported in the city of Mariupol was replicated across other cities, but the port city would again be the site of a temporary ceasefire on Sunday to try and allow citizens to leave.

A previous ceasefire of Saturday was not upheld.

"Hopefully, today we will manage to make the evacuation based on the agreement reached bilaterally between officials both on Ukrainian and Russian sides."

Dominic Raab said all the donations to the Conservative Party are "properly scrutinised and properly declared".

When asked why the Conservative Party needed or wanted so much Russian money in terms of donations over the years, Mr Raab told ITV News: "First of all, there's no foreign donations made, it's illegal and we don't accept them.

"Secondly, our complaint is not with Russian people and many of the entrepreneurs that are here are people who have fled Putin, including some of those that have given to the Conservative Party and, above all, all of our declarations are properly scrutinised and properly declared."

The Deputy Prime Minister added: "Our heart goes out to all the Ukrainians that suffer but also we see lot of Russian decent law-abiding people in this country, who will be very nervous and anxious, right now."

Olha Stefanishyna said despite agreements over ceasefires, Ukrainians would "never trust" what the Russians say.

The Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme every Ukrainian citizen and politician "knows the Russian playbook by heart".

Ms Stefanishyna hit out at Western leaders who refused to impose a no-fly zone over her country.

"My President was as precise as it is possible and we absolutely support from the bottom of his, of our, hearts (in) everything he says because this is what we feel," she said.

"It is very upsetting when the group of 30 leaders or ministers or even ambassadors are (...) gathering itself in a fancy cabinet, with the fancy furniture, and talking about the fancy thing, knowing that Ukraine was over this table for all of (these) years sitting in this fancy offices.

"But now knowing that we can't be there because we are operating under the bombarding of (the) Russian Federation and knowing that their intelligence also confirms that further severe attacks on the civil population - including carpet bombarding of the cities, which are basically happening these days already in some cities - will be taking place."

Dominic Raab told ITV News presenter Nina Hossain that he does not need to be "lectured" about what his father went through.

Mr Raab was asked about the the Government's response to the growing refugee crisis and whether the UK should make it as simple as it was for his father, who fled Czechoslovakia from the Nazis, to come to the UK.

The Deputy Prime Minister said: "I don't need to be lectured by you about what my father went through. And you are talking about something you know little about. It was incredibly difficult for my father to get to the UK."

In relation to Ukraine, he added: "I think we're doing the right thing in the right way. There's been a question about whether we should have security checks.

"Look, this is people coming from a war zone. It is absolutely right, given the foreign fighters that are there alongside of the Russians, that we make sure that we do have security checks precisely so that our generosity is directed to those who deserve our compassion, not those who might seek to harm us."

The head of the Armed Forces has said western countries "have to have confidence that what we're doing is the right thing".

Admiral Sir Tony Radakin told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: "We all have to acknowledge that we're likely to see Russia ratcheting up the violence, we're going to see more indiscriminate shelling, we're going to see more ridiculous violence...

"And the world has to maintain the resolve to keep applying its pressure on Russia, because it's Putin who can bring this to an end."

He went on to say: "The world has been incredibly clear about the repercussions that are being borne by Russia now."

He said its invasion is not going well, that the country is more isolated and less powerful, and that it "cannot continue".

"So we have to have to have confidence that what we're doing is the right thing".

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Government "have to not just isolate Russia, they have to make it impossible for Russia to function".

Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, Sir Keir said: "Our aim is to push the Government further on sanctions.

"We've got the opportunity tomorrow and if sanctions are going to work it's very important that we know who owns what property here in the United Kingdom."

He said his "frustration" was that the situation has "echoes of Afghanistan" where the Government "really only begins to get its act together and respond in the heat of the situation rather than preparing for it beforehand".

More than 1.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine in the past 10 days in the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War, the United Nations has said.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi tweeted: "More than 1.5 million refugees from Ukraine have crossed into neighbouring countries in 10 days - the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II."

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was "very concerned" about reports surrounding the appointment of media mogul Lord Evgeny Lebedev to the House of Lords.

The Sunday Times reported that British intelligence officials withdrew their assessment that giving a peerage to Lord Lebedev posed a national security risk after Boris Johnson intervened.

Sir Keir told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: "I'm very concerned about that story, because it goes to the heart of national security and there's at least the suggestion that the Government and the Prime Minister were warned that there was a national security risk in this particular appointment.

"I think, in the circumstances, what the appropriate thing is for the Intelligence and Security Committee, which is a cross-party committee in Parliament that can have access to confidential material - I think this case should be referred to that committee so they can look into this story.

"This allegation - which is very serious because, of course, it's a matter of national security - I hope the Government will answer it today."

He added: "I think the right thing to do is to refer it to the committee, cross-party committee, that can look at the confidential material and come to a view on what actually happened and the risks that the Government may or may not have taken."

Sir Keir Starmer has said there needs to be a review of defence policy and spending.

Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, Sir Keir said: "I think there does need to be a step back and review of defence policy because this has, I think, blown away some of the assumptions the Government was working on."

Sir Keir said the Labour Party has been critical of the Government for cutting back the army by another 10,000 soldiers, noting "as we have said, we wouldn't have done that".

He went on: "I think on the Government benches, there's a growing sense that there's got to be a review by the Government of its defence policy and strategy, and its funding, and I think that's true."

When asked how much more on defence he would spend, Sir Keir said: "Well, we've said we wouldn't be making the cuts that the Government is currently making. But I think in the middle of a conflict, we have to focus on the job in hand, which is supporting Ukraine and ensuring that Putin is defeated.

"In the aftermath, of course, there's going to have to be a review across Parliament about spending, about priorities about strategy in relation to defence."

Sir Keir Starmer has said it is very important "we demonstrate unity" against Russian aggression when asked if he still thinks the Prime Minister should resign over partygate allegations.

He told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: "I do think there's a basic question of trust. And it does seem a long time ago now, we were talking about all of the allegations that Prime Minister faces. Of course, he is still being investigated by the Metropolitan Police. I do think there's an issue of trust.

"I'm very clear as the leader of the opposition, leader of the Labour Party, that when it comes to standing up to Russian aggression, and standing in support of Ukraine, it's very important in the United Kingdom and in our politics that we show the world that we're united and, therefore, whatever the challenges and frustrations and criticism I have of the Prime Minister, and I've got many on this issue, there is unity, and it's very important that we demonstrate that unity."

When asked if he would therefore withdraw his call for Boris Johnson to resign immediately, he said: "Look, at the moment the Prime Minister is obviously concentrating on the job in hand and we stand united as the United Kingdom on that issue."

Russia has "got itself into a mess" with the whole Ukrainian invasion, the Chief of the Defence Staff has said.

Admiral Sir Tony Radakin told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme that morale in the Russian forces was low and that the Kremlin had lost more troops in a week than the UK did in 20 years in Afghanistan.

"We do know that some of the lead elements of Russian forces have been decimated by the Ukrainian response," he said.

However, Sir Tony warned Russian aggression could be ramped up.

"I think there is a real risk because Russia is struggling with its objectives on the ground in Ukraine - and we've seen from Russia's previous actions in Syria and in Chechnya - where it will turn up the violence, it will lead to more indiscriminate killing and more indiscriminate destruction," he said.

"We have to keep applying the pressure to Russia that this is outrageous and that the sense that because your invasion isn't going very well, that you just become more and more reckless in applying violence is totally unacceptable."

Admiral Sir Tony Radakin played down Vladimir Putin's nuclear threats.

The Chief of the Defence Staff told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: "We've got to maintain a calmness and responsibility so that we don't just react rashly to whatever is the latest, frankly at times, bizarre or ridiculous comment from President Putin."

He added: "So, we are prepared, we are professional armed forces, we will approach this conflict with that level of professionalism and responsibility that you would expect.

"We will also be incredibly confident in our ability to face down President Putin."

Sir Tony was asked whether the West would know beforehand whether Mr Putin would use nuclear weapons and he said: "I don't want to go into the detail but if you look at this conflict, we've had a remarkable level of intelligence and we were saying for months that this is what President Putin was intending to do.

"There are some more discrete elements in terms of warning signs if this was going to start to chart a path towards nuclear escalation."

Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said a no-fly zone over Ukraine "would not help".

The Chief of the Defence Staff told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: "The advice that we as senior military professionals are giving our politicians is to avoid doing things that are tactically ineffective and definitely to avoid doing things that tactically might lead to miscalculation or escalation.

"The no-fly zone would not help.

"Most of the shelling is coming from artillery, most of the destruction is coming from artillery, it's not coming from Russian aircraft.

"If we were to police a no-fly zone, it means that we probably have to take out Russian defence systems and we would have Nato aircraft in the air alongside Russian aircraft, and then the potential of shooting them down and then that leads to an escalation."

The Chief of the Defence Staff has urged Britons not to head to Ukraine to fight.

"We've been very clear that it's unlawful as well as unhelpful for UK military and for the UK population to start going towards Ukraine in that sense," Admiral Sir Tony Radakin told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme.

"Support from the UK, support in whatever way you can. But this isn't really something that you want to rush to in terms of the sound of gunfire. This is about sensible support based in the UK."

Asked if Foreign Secretary Liz Truss should therefore not have said she would support anyone who wanted to fight, he added: "I think she was reflecting (that) she could and that we can all understand that sentiment, and that sentiment needs to be channelled into support for Ukraine.

"But we're saying as professional military people, that actually that is not necessarily the sensible thing to be doing."

The UK still has a direct line of contact into Russia's Ministry of Defence, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said.

The Chief of the Defence Staff told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme that the line was "tested every day".

"We've used that line for me to say to General Gerasimov (Russia's military chief) that we need to speak and I'm waiting for him to come back to me, and other countries also have direct lines in.

"These lines of communication are not as strong as we would want them to be and that's why we're furthering them as best as we can."

Sir Tony was asked if it was inevitable that Russia takes over Ukraine, and he said: "No. I think we've seen a Russian invasion that is not going well. I think we're also seeing a remarkable resistance by Ukraine, both its armed forces and its people.

"We're also seeing the unity of the whole globe coming together with a cohesive approach, whether that's economically, diplomatically, culturally, socially, militarily, applying pressure to Russia, and that needs to continue so that Russia stops this invasion."

Dominic Raab said the UK is urging international leaders to support Ukraine with "everything from military hardware through to cyber resilience" and to prevent a "creeping normalisation" of what Russia is doing in Ukraine.

Discussing Boris Johnson's six-point plan to help Ukraine on Times Radio, Mr Raab said the world had seen such a normalisation of the Russian president's actions before.

"We've seen this in many places; we've seen it in Libya where the Wagner mercenaries operate, we've seen it in Ukraine, whether it's in the Donbas or Crimea, that Putin takes a chunk.

"We express our condemnation and it becomes the de-facto, normal baseline.

"We cannot let that happen in relation to this invasion of Ukraine...

"Otherwise we'll just see more aggression in the future."

Dominic Raab said he was "very sceptical" over any promises made by the Kremlin.

The Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary was asked whether he thought a temporary ceasefire announced for Mariupol would hold and he told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: "I'm very sceptical about any assurances or commitments that President Putin makes.

"Of course, we want to do everything we can. We should exhaust all opportunities to try and provide humanitarian relief. But I think you only have to look at his track record in Syria to see that we need to be very careful to test any assurances Vladimir Putin gives."

Mr Raab said he was also doubtful that talks between Ukraine and Russia would "yield a reasonable solution to this".

"It's always worth keeping the diplomatic door ajar," he said.

He added that sanctions had not yet "created a kind of change of calculus".

Dominic Raab has said he does not think Russian President Vladimir Putin would agree to a humanitarian no-fly zone over Ukraine.

Speaking on Times Radio, the Justice Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister said: "I think it's interesting, I just can't see why Russia would agree to that and what we've been clear on is we're not going to get into direct military conflict between the UK or Nato and Russia."

He added: "We've had ongoing discussions with all of our allies and, indeed, with the Russians, and if we thought that there was an easier or credible route to provide that humanitarian support, of course, we'd want to look at it more seriously."

Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said there was "a very strict and stringent process when anyone is granted a peerage" when asked about Evgeny Lebedev's elevation to the House of Lords.

Mr Raab told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: "I don't know the facts of the case, I wasn't involved in it. But I do know that it was applied very rigorously in this case."

He added: "This was done properly and correctly, and we have procedures and systems in place to make sure it is."

Dominic Raab has suggested support would be undermined for Ukraine if the UK let refugees in without visas.

The Justice Secretary was asked on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme about reports that 150 Ukrainian refugees had been turned away at Calais because they did not have a valid visa.

He said: "Look, if we just open the door not only will we not benefit the people that we need to, the genuine refugees, but I think we undermine the popular support for this very thing, so I don't think that's the right thing to do. We need to make sure that we're acting for those that need our support."

Mr Raab said he expected up to 200,000 Ukrainians could come to the UK through the family dependents route and that "the humanitarian route, that is uncapped".

"We'll work with the United Nations and other agencies, but also individuals, business, charitable sponsors here, and that route for Ukrainians fleeing persecution is uncapped. And of course, we provided £220 million of humanitarian support, which is directly for the Ukrainian people, but also for those countries taking refugees."

He added: "Of course, you find this with conflict situations, most people want to go... either stay in their country of birth and origin or go to a country nearby, so they can return later. I think we can expect that with Ukraine."

The Chancellor will keep support for the cost of living "under constant review", Dominic Raab has said.

On whether the Government is going to take action in the spring statement to alleviate the "increased additional pain" on consumers brought about by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Justice Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister told Times Radio: "I'm sure the Chancellor, as ever, will look at cost of living challenges as part of that.

"I'll just make a couple of points on top of that, though, we actually are relatively low in our dependence on gas from Russia. It's just 4%.

"Of course, I appreciate you talk about the global prices affected by this war. I think the key in terms of supply is going to be pressing the renewables sources, the nuclear sources of energy, as well as making sure that at least transitionally we've got greater resilience through the North Sea oil production.

"In terms of consumers, well, we're already providing £20 billion of support for the cost of living. £9 billion of that, almost half, is focused on energy.

"So, I'm sure the Chancellor will keep this under constant review. But that gives you a sense of the scale of how we're adapting to the situation."

On Boris Johnson's six-point plan in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the shadow defence secretary said the Prime Minister must match his rhetoric with action.

John Healey told Times Radio: "It's exactly what the alliance of not just western states but increasingly international opinion is actually doing.

"In many ways, some of our allies could reasonably turn around and say 'well it's all very well for you, Boris Johnson, but you've got to now match some of your tough rhetoric with your own action, particularly on humanitarian assistance, on diplomacy and on sanctions'."

Mr Healey said it was right of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to set aside calls for the Prime Minister's resignation in the wake of the partygate scandal.

"Those hard, underlying questions that ultimately Boris Johnson will have to return to answer about his law-breaking, about the parties in Downing Street, the police investigations will come back.

"But for now we must stand with other European nations and Labour gives its full backing to the extent the Government will stand by and support the Ukrainians' resistance in Ukraine against the Russian invasion, and the toughest possible sanctions to help isolate and cut Russia out of the international system".

Boris Johnson has said that "never in my life have I seen an international crisis where the dividing line between right and wrong has been so stark", as he urged world leaders to back his six-point plan to tackle Vladimir Putin.

Writing in the New York Times, the Prime Minister said "Western unity has been impressive and heartening".

But he said: "Have we done enough for Ukraine? The honest answer is no."

"We must not allow anyone in the Kremlin to get away with misrepresenting our intentions to find post-facto justification for their war of choice," Mr Johnson wrote.

"We have failed to learn the lessons of Russian behaviour that have led to this point. No-one can say we were not warned: we saw what Russia did in Georgia in 2008, Ukraine in 2014 and even on the streets of the British city of Salisbury. And I know from speaking to my counterparts on recent visits to Poland and Estonia just how acutely they feel the threat.

"It is no longer enough to express warm platitudes about the rules-based international order. We are going to have to actively defend it against a sustained attempt to rewrite the rules by force and other tools such as economic coercion."

The Prime Minister said that despite Vladimir Putin's claims of Nato expansion, "the truth is that Ukraine had no serious prospect of Nato membership in the near future".

Writing in the New York Times, Boris Johnson dismissed the Russian leader's justification for his invasion of Ukraine as a "confected pretext", and said: "This is not a Nato conflict and it will not become one. No ally has sent combat troops to Ukraine.

"We have no hostility towards the Russian people and we have no desire to impugn a great nation, a world power and a founding member of the United Nations. We despair of the decision to send young innocent Russians into a bloody and futile war."

The PM said: "We were ready to respond to Russia's stated security concerns through negotiation. I and many other Western leaders have spoken to President Putin to understand his perspective."

He added: "It was now clear diplomacy never had a chance. But it is precisely because of our respect for Russia that we find the actions of the Putin regime so unconscionable."

He warned: "We need to prepare now for even darker days ahead."

The Home Office said "around 50" visas had been granted under the Ukraine Family Scheme as of 10am on Sunday.

Some 5,535 online applications have been completed and submitted online and 2,368 people had booked a visa appointment to submit their application and biometric information, the Government said.

The Home Office said 11,750 people have started but not completed an online application.

Home Secretary Priti Patel has said the UK is "doing everything possible" to speed up efforts to grant visas to Ukrainians fleeing the conflict.

She visited the Ukrainian Social Club in Holland Park, west London, on Sunday afternoon and dropped off a bag of donations including wet wipes, nappies and non-perishable foods before meeting volunteers helping with relief efforts.

Ms Patel later held a meeting with Ukrainian ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko at the nearby embassy.

Asked by a reporter if it was acceptable that around 1% of submitted applications had been granted in the first 48 hours of the visa scheme, she said: "Let's be clear, this is the first scheme in the world that's up and running in this short period of time.

"Ten thousand applications and yes, grants are happening as we stand here right now and are speaking. So I'm surging staff across all application centres across the entire European Union as well as in the border countries such as Poland, where I was the other day and obviously where huge numbers of people are coming through."

She added: "This is an incredible scheme and we are doing everything possible, surging capacity across every single application centre across the EU."

She said staff are being flown into border countries "so we can fast track and speed up applications and it's right that we do this".

The Economic Crime Bill will ensure there is a "sound legal footing" for the Government to "go after" oligarchs, the Home Secretary said.

Priti Patel said: "I think every political party in Westminster understands the sense of emergency around taking the action and putting the legislation on statute, on a sound legal footing, so that we can absolutely go after the oligarchs, reclaim their money, but also sanction these individuals.

"We're doing everything that we can in emergency time, and we've drafted this legislation in record time and it's coming to Parliament tomorrow."

She said the Government had been "working night and day on this to bring this emergency legislation to Parliament".

Boris Johnson has told President Volodymyr Zelensky that "the British people stand fully behind the Ukrainian people" when the pair spoke on Sunday afternoon.

Downing Street said the Prime Minister told his counterpart that "international support and admiration for President Zelensky and the whole of Ukraine grows every day".

A No 10 spokesperson said: "The leaders discussed the increasing threat Russia's barbaric attacks pose to Ukrainian civilians and the Prime Minister underlined the UK's determination to ensure Putin fails."

The PM spoke about the support offered by the UK and his six-point plan outlined over the weekend, and the spokesperson said: "The leaders discussed the urgent needs of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Prime Minister undertook to work with partners to provide further defensive equipment.

"The Prime Minister and President Zelensky also discussed the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Ukraine, precipitated by Russia's indiscriminate attacks and ceasefire breaches."

Mr Johnson also promised to continue to press other countries to take further action to remove Russia from the Swift payment system.

"The leaders agreed to continue speaking to ensure the wishes of the Ukrainian people are at the forefront of the international response going forward," the spokesperson said.

Priti Patel insisted people are not being turned back at Calais.

French interior minister Gerald Darmanin on Sunday said it was "inhumane" of the UK to turn away refugees arriving at the French port city if they did not have a valid visa.

But Ms Patel said: "Let me just correct what has been said by the French government. The British Government is not turning anybody around or turning anybody back at all.

"And I think it's really important to emphasise that, particularly at this time, when all nations across Europe must work together to help and support people in need and fleeing Ukraine at this awful, awful time."

The Home Secretary said it is "wrong to say that we are turning people back, we are not".

She added: "I have staff in Calais to provide support to Ukrainian families that have left Ukraine to come to the United Kingdom. It is wrong and it is inaccurate to say that we are not providing support on the ground. We are."

Ukrainian ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko said the visa process for refugees fleeing his homeland for Britain could be simplified.

Speaking outside the Ukrainian embassy in west London, he said: "We believe that some of the procedures can be really simplified.

"We will sort it out later, now we have to let as maximum people we can have as possible.

"All the security checks should be in place for obvious reasons because it is a war."

But he said any "bureaucratic nonsense" should be cleared for now, which he said the UK is already doing both with immigration and on sanctions.

He said he believes the UK is "on the forefront of the effort" to help Ukraine.

Russian military who conducted an assault which caused planned evacuations from the Ukrainian city of Mariupol to be halted are "animals", Vadym Prystaiko said.

Asked about what had happened, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK said: "Animals. That's the only reaction we have right now."

He said such action goes against not only laws but international norms as "human lives (have) been shelled by the Russians as they (Ukrainians) tried to escape".

The Home Secretary was asked about how Britain can help in the creation of humanitarian corridors in Ukraine, he said.

He said: "One of the issues the community was raising with the Home Secretary right now is how Ukrainian sky can close from these bombers which are bombing both military but civilians as well.

"How we can create these humanitarian corridors, which would allow food and medicine and supplies to come to Ukraine and as many refugees as possible (to leave)."

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has confirmed that a second ceasefire attempt in Ukraine has again not been upheld.

In an intelligence update posted on Twitter on Sunday afternoon, the MoD said: "For the second day in a row, a ceasefire agreement to enable the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol failed. The ceasefire was scheduled between 10:00 and 21:00 local time, but the agreement was violated within hours of its planned implementation."

The update said that Russian artillery strikes on the port city "have likely remained at the high level seen in recent days".

It added: "As with yesterday, Russia has accused Ukraine of breaking the ceasefire agreement. This is probably an additional attempt to diminish responsibility for civilian casualties caused by continued Russian strikes on the city."

Amendments to the Economic Crime Bill will allow the UK to implement "harder and faster" sanctions against those associated with Putin and his regime, the Government said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: "Punishing sanctions are meaningless until properly implemented, and these changes will allow us to pursue Putin's allies in the UK with the full backing of the law, beyond doubt or legal challenge."

MPs will consider the amendments in the Commons on Monday.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: "These amendments give us the chance to bring even more crippling sanctions against Putin and his regime".

A resident of Kherson, the Russia-occupied Ukrainian city, has called for support from the West after a weekend of protests in the port.

The man, who asked to be referred to as Jimmy, told the PA news agency: "There were signs saying 'Kherson is Ukraine', there were signs saying 'go away'. They shouted 'fascists'.

"The Russians are bringing their own food and we don't want to accept it, so of course we want the western civilisation to help us fight against the Russians.

"What we are desperate to get right now is of course the protection from air. Our air defence systems are crushed and our planes are not too many. The Russians are demolishing our cities, our civilians, this is the horror that we are going through right now.

"This is where the Russians are holding us from winning against them because on the ground we are way better than the Russian forces.

"Their motivation for them is to free Ukraine from Nazis, but then they come in and they don't see any Nazis."

PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is separating its firm in Russia - which has a staff of around 3,700 - from the rest of its global network as a result of the invasion of Ukraine.

In a statement, PwC said: "As a result of the Russian government's invasion of Ukraine we have decided that, under the circumstances, PwC should not have a member firm in Russia and consequently PwC Russia will leave the network.

"Our main focus at PwC continues to be doing all we can to help our Ukrainian colleagues and support the humanitarian efforts to aid the people of Ukraine who have been devastated by this invasion.

"We are also committed to working with our colleagues at PwC Russia to undertake an orderly transition for the business, and with a focus on the wellbeing of our 3,700 colleagues in PwC Russia."

Home Secretary Priti Patel has written to Interpol requesting the suspension of Russia's access to its systems.

Ms Patel said: "The UK stands shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine.

"In response to Ukraine's request, and alongside counterparts from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US, I have written to the Secretary General of Interpol to ask that Interpol and its Executive Committee takes a decision on the immediate suspension of Russia's access to its systems.

"Russia has a history of abusing these systems, and we must act now to protect the integrity of Interpol."

TALLINN, March 8 (Reuters) - All Russian and Belarus banks must be removed from the SWIFT payments messaging system, and cryptocurrencies should be restricted to close sanction loopholes, Estonia's prime minister told visiting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday.

"Our focus must be on full isolation of Russia from the free world," Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told a joint news conference with Blinken. (Reporting by Simon Lewis and Andrius Sytas, editing by Terje Solsvik and Gwladys Fouche)

Russian forces north-west of Kyiv have made "little progress" and are "suffering continued losses" at the hands of the Ukrainian military, a Ministry of Defence update said.

A "notable decrease in overall Russian air activity" over Ukraine has been noted in recent days, "likely due to the unexpected effectiveness and endurance" of Kyiv's air defences, it added.

The update also accused Russia of deploying conscript troops to Ukraine and said Vladimir Putin will have to draw from across his forces "and other sources to replace his losses".

A senior Tory MP has accused a colleague of spouting "utterly risible, illiterate, immoral and offensive bile" over Ukrainian refugees.

Simon Hoare, the chair of the Commons Northern Ireland Committee, told Daniel Kawczynski in a tweet that he does "not speak for the Tory party".

He was responding to Mr Kawcyznski tweeting: "British Left wing parties demand Britain takes in more Ukrainian refugees. This is illiterate and immoral.

"When war is over Ukrainians will need to return home to rebuild their country. We should be supporting Ukrainian refugees in frontline states like Poland & Romania."

The executive chairman of a major advertising agency has said it will be "very difficult for brands to remain in Russia", particularly as the atrocities committed in Ukraine worsen.

S4Capital's Sir Martin Sorrell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I think given what we're seeking in Ukraine and the barbaric acts we're seeing, and the atrocities we're seeing, I think it's very difficult for brands to remain in Russia.

"The argument is that you don't penalise the population but ultimately the only way of solving this absent of the negotiations that are going on at the moment is China intervening or there being some internal regime change inside Russia.

"Increased economic pressure might achieve that. So I think, as a result, what we've seen in particular in the last few days, and the bombing of a hospital in Mariupol being a particular atrocity, I think it's very difficult for brands to maintain their position."

Sir Keir Starmer has been greeted by Estonian defence minister Kalle Laanet at the country's ministry of defence in Tallinn.

The Labour leader shook hands with Mr Laanet ahead of a visit to Tapa military base further east where he will meet Nato troops.

His visit to the country, which shares a 180-mile border with Russia to the east, marks day 15 of Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

UK Armed Forces minister James Heappey said he was "hugely concerned" at warnings from the Biden administration that Russia might seek to use chemical weapons in Ukraine.

He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "We in London read exactly the same intelligence as Washington did, and I think it's right that the Americans have declassified that intelligence in order to, frankly, call President Putin out on this and to deter him from doing so.

"He needs to be absolutely clear that the use of chemical weapons is utterly abhorrent.

"What we're seeing on our TV screens at the moment is bad enough. When you are launching artillery strikes against maternity hospitals, that is lower than low. "

He added: "If he were to launch chemical weapons that would be a whole other order of magnitude."

Asked whether there has been any mention that smaller nuclear weapons could also be deployed, he said: "Of course, that is a very, very small possibility because they exist in the Russian arsenal, but to be clear that is not the threat that we are particularly worried about.

"I don't think that they are currently in the Russian mind but it would be wrong of me to say that, of course, we are not aware of that as a threat."

He said that the huge amounts of massed artillery are a more pressing concern.

At least 17 people, including pregnant woman and doctors, have been injured after a maternity hospital was bombed in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, the deputy mayor of the city has said.

Sergei Orlov told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: "The last information that we have about victims is that most of the visitors were in a bomb shelter.

"That's why we have information about 17 injured people - and that's mostly pregnant women and doctors who work in this hospital.

"We don't have information about children, but the information is being collected at the moment."

Defence minister James Heappey said British troops will assist Ukrainian visa applications in Poland, but the Home Office believes it can cope with applications in France.

He told Sky News: "We're not sending any to Calais.

"I met with the immigration minister yesterday and their feeling is the visa applications centre in northern France are centres they can reinforce themselves.

"What they've asked us to do is to supply manpower to Poland, which is the busiest of the visa application centres by some margin.

"We're in the process of making that happen and we'll help out in any way we can."

The Russian army knew that they were bombing a maternity hospital in Mariupol, the deputy mayor of the city has claimed.

Sergei Orlov told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: "I am absolutely sure that they know about this facility.

"This is the third hospital that they have destroyed in the city. The previous day they destroyed hospital number nine by artillery shelling. This was a Covid hospital with 300 beds.

"They have also attacked and destroyed a blood collection station in Mariupol. So, it is the third hospital, I'm absolutely sure they know what are their targets."

Defence minister James Heappey said Home Secretary Priti Patel is considering changing the visa processes and the checks required for Ukrainian refugees to come to the UK.

He told Sky News: "There's effectively two sides to what can be done to bring refugees here more quickly.

"There's a policy choice around the checks that we go through, but equally you can increase the capacity of the pipeline to process more people more quickly.

"We'll supply as many people as they need in order to be able to get the highest number of people processed in the quickest time possible and then the Home Secretary has got some choices, which I know she's considering, around how to further change the visa process and what checks might be necessary within it."

Defence minister James Heappey warned British troops who go AWOL to fight in Ukraine risk Russia wrongly accusing the UK of being "a belligerent" in the war.

Addressing the service people, he told Sky News: "They will be in an awful lot of trouble. To be clear, the Army has put out a statement overnight to say this. It is illegal for British service personnel to first of all go absent without leave in the first place, but to go absent without leave in order to fight in a foreign war is simply unacceptable, and frankly risks the United Kingdom being wrongly claimed by Russia to be a belligerent in this.

"Service people who might think they are doing the right thing should reflect it is 100% not the correct thing to be doing.

"I'd go further and say it's not just the very small number of soldiers who have gone AWOL apparently to go fight in Ukraine, I would say to the wider veterans community I know ... you accept the unlimited liability in the service of your country to stand up for what's right in the world, that there's a thing deep inside you as a soldier that makes you see TV images and makes you want to go and fight for what's right, but no good comes from British service people or veterans going to Ukraine to be a part of this."

He told Times Radio a "very small number" of British troops, around three or four troops is the number he has heard, have gone to Ukraine.

Defence minister James Heappey has accused Russia of committing a war crime by striking a hospital in Mariupol.

He told BBC Breakfast: "We ask ourselves the question how did this happen? Was it an indiscriminate use of artillery or missiles into a built-up area, or was a hospital explicitly targeted?

"Both are equally despicable, both, as the Ukrainians have pointed out, would amount to a war crime.

"So, what matters beyond the outrage of the fact that this has happened in the first place is to make sure all this is catalogued so when - and they surely will be - President Putin and everybody in the military chain of command beneath him - because war crimes are committed at every level not just the ultimate decisionmaker - people will be held to account for what they are doing in. It's utterly despicable."

Pressed on whether he thinks the attack constitutes a war crime, he replied: "Yes, if you deliberately target a piece of civilian infrastructure like a hospital, yes.

"If you use indiscriminate artillery into an urban area without due regard for the reality, you could hit a protected site like a hospital, then that too in my view is."

Defence minister James Heappey said Priti Patel must decide how to reduce the bureaucracy of security checks for Ukrainian refugees while balancing the "risk".

He told BBC Breakfast: "In a broad brush, I would say that there are lots of things that you could choose to do from a policy perspective, I think the Home Secretary has to weigh that up against risk.

"A lot of people have made the point this is very different to Afghanistan, this is predominantly a refugee flow of women and children because fighting-age men have remained in Ukraine to fight.

"I know the Home Secretary is very aware of that but she needs to make decisions around how to change visa policy and, crucially, the security checks that are done within visa policy in a way that still gives her the assurance that she needs that at a time of acute competition in Europe between the West and Russia we're not making the mistake of dropping our guard altogether.

"The Home Secretary is very much aware of the need to remove as much bureaucracy as she can but she does have to balance that against the risk, and I know that she'll make the right decision."

Sir Keir Starmer has said Labour "stands steadfast in solidarity with Ukraine" ahead of his visit to Tapa military base in Estonia.

After meeting Estonian defence minister Kalle Laanet, the Labour leader tweeted: "Today, @JohnHealey_MP and I are in Estonia, to meet with our allies and British troops.

"Labour stands steadfast in solidarity with Ukraine and we are committed to supporting our Nato allies."

Defence minister James Heappey warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that the use of chemical weapons has "triggered an international response" in the past.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I don't think it's helpful to get into any firm commitment right now about where that red line sits, but I think President Putin needs to be very clear that when other countries have used chemical weapons it has caused an international response.

"I think he should reflect very urgently on what has happened to other countries where they have used them."

He added: "President Putin needs to be clear that the use of chemical weapons is just the most despicable thing that anybody can imagine.

"As horrid as the pictures we are seeing on our TV screens today of an artillery strike against a hospital (are), they are but nothing by comparison to the suffering and devastation that chemical weapons cause."

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and shadow defence secretary John Healey have arrived at the Tapa military base in Estonia.

They were greeted by troops playing the bagpipes and will be meeting Colonel Dai Bevan, Commander of the Nato Enhanced Forward Presence, this afternoon.

A Home Office minister will be called to the Commons to explain the visas situation.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper has been granted an urgent question on the ongoing barriers facing Ukrainians seeking to flee the war zone and come to the UK.

Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has been added to the UK's sanctions list, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said.

She said Vladimir Putin's attacks on Ukraine involved "new levels of evil by the hour" and the Government had announced further sanctions "against individuals linked to the Russian Government".

"This list includes Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club," she said.

She acknowledged this would have an impact on the premiership side but a special licence would enable it to continue operating.

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said on Twitter: "Our priority is to hold those who have enabled the Putin regime to account.

"Today's sanctions obviously have a direct impact on Chlesea & its fans. We have been working hard to ensure the club & the national game are not unnecessarily harmed by these important sanctions.

"To ensure the club can continue to compete and operate we are issuing a special licence that will allow fixtures to be fulfilled, staff to be paid and existing ticket holders to attend matches while, crucially, depriving Abramovich of benefiting from his ownership of the club.

"I know this brings some uncertainty, but the Government will work with the league & clubs to keep football being played while ensuring sanctions hit those intended. Football clubs are cultural assets and the bedrock of our communities. We're committed to protecting them."

Other oligarchs have been sanctioned alongside Roman Abramovich, including Oleg Deripaska - an industrialist worth £2 billion who has had close links with the British political establishment.

The list includes:

- Roman Abramovich: owner of Chelsea FC and has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel.

- Oleg Deripaska: has stakes in En+ Group.

- Igor Sechin: chief executive of Rosneft.

- Andrey Kostin: chairman of VTB bank.

- Alexei Miller: CEO of energy company Gazprom.

- Nikolai Tokarev: president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft.

- Dmitri Lebedev: chairman of the Board of Directors of Bank Rossiya.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: "There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin's vicious assault on Ukraine.

"Today's sanctions are the latest step in the UK's unwavering support for the Ukrainian people. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: "Today's sanctions show once again that oligarchs and kleptocrats have no place in our economy or society. With their close links to Putin they are complicit in his aggression.

"The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. They should hang their heads in shame.

"Our support for Ukraine will not waver. We will not stop in this mission to ramp up the pressure on the Putin regime and choke off funds to his brutal war machine."

Sir Keir Starmer has told Nato troops in Estonia that "the eyes of the world are upon you" as he visited Tapa military base with shadow defence secretary John Healey.

Surrounded by tanks including one draped with a Union flag, Sir Keir thanked soldiers for providing "reassurance" through their presence at the base in the country bordering Russia.

He added that "there is no time for party politics" because the world faces "a very grave situation" amid Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

Home Secretary Priti Patel said she had received assurances on security matters which enabled her to make changes to the Ukrainian family scheme, telling the Commons: "From Tuesday, I can announce that Ukrainians with passports will no longer need to go to a visa application centre to give their biometrics before they come to the UK.

"Instead, once their application has been considered and appropriate checks completed, they will receive direct notification that they're eligible for the scheme and can come to the UK.

"In short, Ukrainians with passports will be able to get permission to come here fully online from wherever they are and will be able to give their biometrics once in Britain.

"This will mean that visa application centres across Europe can focus their efforts on helping Ukrainians without passports."

Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy welcomed the sanctioning of Roman Abramovich "at last".

The Labour MP said in a statement: "At last! This is the right decision. But it should not have taken the Government weeks.

"Too few oligarchs linked to Putin's rogue regime have so far faced sanctions from the UK Government. We are lagging far behind allies in the EU and the US.

"It is right that, under pressure from Labour, the Government U-turned to strengthen sanctions legislation. Ministers must now move faster to continue to close the sanctions gap."

Labour shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper asked if the Government would utilise the armed forces to set up emergency centres to help bring people to the UK.

"Why does it always take being hauled into the House of Commons to make basic changes to help vulnerable people who are fleeing from Ukraine?" she asked.

She added: "It is welcome that she's now introducing the online approach, that we know they tried different ways of doing for the Hong Kong visas, but why has it taken so long when she has had intelligence for weeks, if not months, that she needed to prepare for a Russian invasion of Ukraine?

"Why still if we've still got to wait until Tuesday for this new system to come in, what is to happen for everybody else in the meantime? Why is she not bringing in the armed forces?

"They've offered to help. We've had a thousand troops on stand-by to provide humanitarian help for two weeks, so why not use them now to set up the emergency centres and to get people passported through as rapidly as possible and get them into the country?"

Labour shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the UK's response to people fleeing Ukraine has been "shameful".

She asked in the Commons: "Is this still just being restricted to those with family? Are they still going to have to fill in multiple online forms, or would she now say that all those who want to come to the UK who have fled the fighting in Ukraine can now come here without having to fill in loads of online forms or jump through a whole load of hoops?

"This has just been shameful, making vulnerable people push from pillar to post in their hour of need, week after week we have seen this happen. It is deeply wrong to leave people in this terrible state. Our country is better than this, if she can't get this sorted out, frankly she should hand the job over to somebody else who can."

The Home Secretary faced calls from her own back benches to set up more processing centres in the UK specifically for elderly and vulnerable Ukrainians fleeing war.

Conservative former minister Harriett Baldwin said: "I want to make a further suggestion, a practical one I hope, that could alleviate the situation. The House of Commons library says that there are 35,000 Ukrainian citizens here in the UK.

"I know that they are sick to death of worrying for their elderly mothers, babies, grandchildren and so on.

"Would it not be possible for us to have a hub for them here in the UK where everything could be done from here and they could be given provisional visas to come into the country, and then we check the biometrics here?"

Priti Patel said: "We are actually doing this across the country now. Yesterday I was in Manchester, we are working with the Ukrainian community groups there and also in Derby and, in fact, there is a whole network of the Ukrainian diaspora."

She added the Ukrainian community had "asked to have hubs in community centres" in the UK, telling MPs: "We are establishing that, but we are working with the community to do that."

Home Secretary Priti Patel said visa applications are important to provide verification of status and invoked the Windrush scandal as a situation to be avoided.

She said the Home Office was intending to give a statement on Thursday morning on the issue and said: "I've always maintained that we would take a pragmatic and agile approach to our response.

"We are making important changes. She (Yvette Cooper ) has asked why are not making these changes immediately - they are subject to digital verification and there is no comparison to MNO (British National Overseas) schemes whatsoever because 90% of Ukrainians do not have chipped passports, so they would be excluded."

She said: "Visa applications are important in terms of this process, and what we are seeing, and it is important that we're flexible in our response and we have been."

She added: "I think this country, and all governments including a probably a government that she once served in, will recognise that there was something known as the Windrush scandal and it's important that everyone arrives into the UK has physical and digital records of their status here in the UK to ensure that they are accessible to schemes.

"The process is absolutely vital in terms of the verification, notification and permission to travel, but importantly to give people the status when they come to the United Kingdom to have that right to work, the right to access and benefits, and also the digital verification of their status."

Many Ukrainians fleeing war want to "stay in the region" and eventually go home instead of travelling to the UK and further afield, Priti Patel has agreed.

Conservative former minister Andrew Mitchell said: "Of course, she is right that many of the people who are fleeing from this appalling murder and mayhem, from war crimes, and from breaches of the international rules of war, they want to remain as close as possible to the areas from which they have been driven, so that when this appalling catastrophe is over they can return.

"Will she keep in touch with our European partners on both their practices and procedures so that we can help these desperate people, who our constituents are rightly intent on us assisting, and to ensure that we are part of a co-ordinated and effective European response to this horrendous humanitarian crisis?"

Priti Patel replied: "He is absolutely right both in his comments but also in terms of the co-ordinated approach that must be taken.

"It is very clear that families want to stay in the region. On a daily basis I am receiving calls from my counterparts from ministers of the interior in the region who are asking for aid to support those families who wish to stay in the region because they want to go back home, that is a really important point to make.

"The ambassadors in the region are saying this as well."

Labour chair of the home affairs committee Dame Diana Johnson pressed the Home Secretary on why the company subcontracted by her department to carry out biometric checks is "allowed to profit from the suffering and misery of Ukrainians".

She told MPs: "I want to ask her about TLSc (TLScontact) subcontracted by the Home Office to carry out biometric checks.

"The chief inspector of borders and immigration told the Home Secretary that TLSc, the TLSc contract was so hell-bent on making profit that its use posed a risk of reputational damage to the UK.

"Now, with Ukrainians fleeing for their lives and the chaos at the visa application centres with long waits and few appointments, can the Secretary of State tell me why this company is allowed to profit from the suffering and misery of Ukrainians by offering them, if they make additional payments, their cases will be expedited, they'll be given quicker appointments. Is that right?"

Priti Patel replied: "No. Let me just share the information that I know about the contracted service with TLS. First and foremost, that we have surge capacity, and I've said this several times in the House. We have visa application centres and that is a contractual process that we have, alongside working with Home Office staff in country and further staff have been sent out.

"She has asked specifically about the contractual arrangements with TLS. Our priority has been to surge their staff in country to create more appointments and we have surged appointments. There have been 6,000 appointments available this week. As of Tuesday 15, there'll be 13,000 appointments with people that don't have documentation passports."

The Home Secretary added: "With regards to Ukrainian individuals, family nationals, Ukrainian nationals coming to the United Kingdom to be reunited with their families, this is a free service. There are no charges in place whatsoever."

The Home Secretary told MPs various countries bordering Ukraine are asking "different requirements from the Home Office in terms of how we undertake our checks".

Priti Patel's comments came as Labour former minister Chris Bryant told her "we have been really running to catch up".

The MP for Rhondda said: "The thing that still nags away at me is, as I understand it, and as we were talking to the foreign affairs committee, the Government has known since October or November of last year that Putin either wanted or intended to do this.

"So on so many levels, we've been really running to catch up and I think a lot of us are asking 'why didn't we know that we needed to put all this in place like two months ago?'"

Priti Patel replied: "Of course, we've know that this attack was absolutely planned. What we are finding though, and the schemes that we have, obviously have been developed with the governments within the region. I must emphasise that.

"Currently, right now various countries within the region are asking different requirements from the Home Office in terms of how we undertake our checks, how we process individuals, and we are trying to simplify this so that it just makes it easier across the board.

"So if I may, in Poland last week, the Polish government tells us please do not process people near the border or within close proximity of the border. Please use your visa application centres. The Hungarian government have asked us for a totally different approach and asked us for liaison officers on the ground. The Romanian government are asking us to come to the border. So, we have deliberately chosen to use the facilities of the visa application centres to give the certainty and consistency in approach."

Home Secretary Priti Patel said the digital system would allow "important checks" and appeared to suggest Labour had created "misinformation" about visa appointments.

She said: "It's really important to remember again that, yes, we have known this attack has been coming, but we have to work with the intelligence and security agencies." She said the "important checks" can be done through the digital process.

Addressing criticisms from Labour, she said Ukrainian families want to see the country come together.

"If I can just reflect on many of the comments and observations that I've heard directly from the Ukrainian members of the community in this country who I have spent a great deal of time with this week, not just on their application, how applications are processed," she said, adding "there is a very clear application process for families".

She appeared to dismiss criticisms there is too much paperwork and accused Labour of creating "misinformation" about visa appointments, and said Ukrainians in the UK want to see the country "come together" in support and take a "collective approach" in helping get their family members to the UK.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has avoided answering whether he agrees with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss' suggestion that oligarchs linked to Putin have blood on their hands over the Ukraine invasion, but said they are "supporting the appalling situation that we see unfolding before us on a daily basis".

Speaking at Tapa military base in Estonia, he told the PA news agency: "I think it's very important that we take the strongest possible measures against all of those linked to the Putin regime and we've been supportive of what the Government has done on sanctions but we do want them to go further and faster on this.

"The numbers of oligarchs that are being targeted and also the sanctions that are going in."

When asked again whether he agreed that oligarchs linked to Putin had blood on their hands, Sir Keir said: "Anybody who's supported Putin is supporting the appalling situation that we see unfolding before us on a daily basis.

"At the moment the most immediate and important thing is that we have the most effective sanctions in place not just to isolate Russia but to cripple Russia's ability to function."

SNP MP Joanna Cherry said she welcomed the "U-turn" from the Government on Ukrainian refugees, adding in the Commons: "Will the Home Secretary also take the opportunity to apologise to the Ukrainian refugees whose suffering has been needlessly exacerbated by the Home Office's ineptitude?

"And will she apologise to many of my constituents who have Ukrainian relatives whose suffering has been exacerbated by her department's ineptitude?"

Home Secretary Priti Patel, in her reply, said the UK Government has been working with the Ukrainian community to "achieve the right outcomes".

Conservative MP Laura Trott (Sevenoaks) asked: "If a Ukrainian has a Ukrainian ID card rather than a passport, can they apply entirely online?"

Ms Patel replied: "No, this will be passports only", and said: "This is part of the problem of the wider challenge we've had in terms of documentation. These types of cases will need to go to VACs (visa application centres) but we've just increased capacity to over 13,000 appointments."

Labour MP Barry Sheerman (Huddersfield) acknowledged Ms Patel is doing a "difficult job at this stressful time", adding: "One tiny bit of advice: we really want to keep this cross-party support for the people in Ukraine, but will she remember that sometimes her tone is a bit aggressive and she did lose some of us on this side when she seemed to suggest that we couldn't be trusted with security information?"

Sir Keir Starmer could not explain why Labour supports emergency visas for Ukrainians instead of offering the visa-free policy of the EU when questioned at Tapa military base in Estonia.

When asked what the reasoning was behind Labour's policy on the visas, he said: "I'm here in Estonia with British forces who have an incredible reputation across the world, enhancing our reputation as the United Kingdom.

"The Home Office approach to visas has been the complete opposite, a complete shambles that is diminishing our reputation across the world.

"We've got a Home Office where the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing and they need to restore their reputation, get on with the job, and find a way of having a safe route to sanctuary for people who are desperately fleeing for their lives."

The Labour leader also chose not to comment on whether he was worried about a small number of British Army troops who have defied orders and deserted for Ukraine, and what message this sends to Mr Putin.

Sir Keir Starmer has said the Government's "slow" response to imposing sanctions on oligarchs amid the Ukraine invasion bears "echoes of Afghanistan".

When asked about sanctions on Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, he said: "I'm slightly frustrated, we called for this weeks ago and whilst we're very supportive of the action the Government has taken on sanctions, there are echoes of Afghanistan here. We need to go further and faster on this."

He added: "I called for these sanctions against Abramovich two weeks ago now and a feature of the Government's reaction here is that they are too slow.

"I support what they are doing and we voted for these sanctions to go through, but we do want a Government to go further and faster, and not be so slow."

When asked who else the Government should be sanctioning, Sir Keir said: "Every oligarch and those supporting Putin in any way should be sanctioned.

"So, we want more sanctions against more people, further and faster, we will support the Government in this, support the whole House on this, but they do need to go further and faster."

A woman trying to reach the UK was told to return to the Ukrainian capital, MPs have heard.

Home Secretary Priti Patel said if such a comment had been made then it was "thoroughly inappropriate".

Speaking in the Commons, Labour MP Rachael Maskell (York Central) said: "The Home Secretary has been on the wrong side of history and the wrong side of humanity.

"We're talking about women, children and older people - and my constituent's friend, who has just crossed the border into Poland and was told, when she went to get her visa, to go back to a city called Kyiv, in the middle of a warzone.

"There's still chaos at the borders. The Home Secretary is shaking her head but she was. There's chaos at the borders, so why can't people come visa-free to the UK border to collect their documentation and then to get that warm welcome that she talks about?"

Ms Patel said she could not comment on the anecdotal evidence given, adding: "Kyiv is obviously under siege and it's thoroughly inappropriate if anybody has made that comment."

Priti Patel echoed concerns over "ethnic cleansing" linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Conservative MP Bob Blackman (Harrow East) told the Commons: "President Putin has not only unleashed death and destruction on the people of Ukraine but he's also involved in ethnic cleansing and we should face up to that.

"Many of those fleeing in fear of their lives will want to go back after Putin's forces have gone from the country, others will want to resettle.

"So will (Ms Patel) make the system as flexible as possible so that those who want to resettle in the UK can do so, but those who want to come on a temporary basis will be able to return to their native country?"

Home Secretary Ms Patel said there is a recognition that people will want to return home once it is safe, adding: "The point about ethnic cleansing is so valid, there are still people of Ukrainian origin in Russia that are subject to such appalling persecution."

Ms Patel said these people are "in our thoughts", including in considerations of how "we want to help them too".

The Government is "open" to a sale of Chelsea FC if a licence is approved by the Treasury but Roman Abramovich must not be allowed to profit, Downing Street said.

A spokesman for Boris Johnson said: "We are now talking to Chelsea Football Club and those conversations will continue, it would be part of those discussions the terms of any specific licence that's granted to allow any sale to proceed.

"The important thing is under no circumstances would any sale allow Roman Abramovich to profit from that or take any money from that sale."

The spokesman added: "It's fair to say the Government is open to the sale of the club but currently it would require another licence, and that would require further conversation with the Treasury and other departments."

Downing Street stressed that Boris Johnson considers Nato a "defensive alliance" when asked whether Russia using chemical weapons in Ukraine would trigger an international response.

A spokesman for Boris Johnson added: "It's obviously the case that we and our allies will continue to monitor the situation closely considering the history of Russia and its proxies using chemical weapons, and the false allegations the Russian government has been making about others developing them."

The Government should sanction the "proxies" of Russian oligarchs in the UK, ministers heard.

Labour former minister Chris Bryant said: "Can he explain something to me? That the Foreign Affairs Select Committee was told earlier this week both by the Foreign Secretary and by other people that Foreign Office officials identified as early as 2019 that the sanctions regime we brought in in 2018 was simply not going to be fast enough or easy enough to use if we had a situation such as we have today.

"Why on earth didn't the Government do something much sooner about it? I am delighted that Roman Abramovich and (Oleg) Deripaska have been sanctioned today, to be honest I think they should have been sanctioned several years ago.

"Are we going to tackle the people who have acted as proxies for these people? Like Greg Barker? Arron Banks? Ben Elliot? Are we going to sanction some of the people - all the people who have been acting as proxies for them?

"Are we going to sanction some of the people like Dmitry Mazepin, who are Belarusians who have been actively supporting the invasion in Ukraine? Because I think the whole House wants to take a full united approach to this but we just worry that the UK sanctioned seven people today, the EU - all 27 countries - sanctioned 160 yesterday."

Replying to a question from Labour MP Chris Bryant, Commons Leader Mark Spencer said: "I think we now are in a place where we have the most robust sanctions regime in place where we can take action against some of the individuals that he named.

"He acknowledges we are taking action, today we have announced sanctions against two individuals, well, two he named and five others.

"I don't think it is helpful to have a running commentary on individual names in this chamber but he should rest assured the United Kingdom is taking action, will continue to take action and we will be very robust in those sanctions."

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said the special licence for Chelsea would "protect the game, the club and its fans".

She told the BBC: "Roman Abramovich cannot benefit from the club. But it is important to note that fans can still - if you have existing tickets and existing season ticket holders - can still go to matches, the match will still go ahead on Sunday.

"They can still go to away matches. Those working at the club will still be paid and the players can still be paid."

Asked whether Mr Abramovich had been given too much warning of the impending sanctions, allowing him to move assets, she said: "This country abides by the rule of law.

"In order to sanction someone, you have to have the evidence to do so.

"I know that the Foreign Office has been working very hard to gather that evidence together, they have now done so, which is why those sanctions were announced this morning which included Abramovich."

No 10 said the changes being brought in by Home Secretary Priti Patel to streamline the online visa application system for Ukrainians would help the UK to process refugees "quicker".

Asked about if the security risk from people applying through the Ukraine Family Scheme was deemed to have reduced, a spokesman for the Prime Minister told reporters: "I'm not going to get into commenting on intelligence, which you know we never do.

"But it is obviously the case that safety and security remains paramount, and remains a priority.

"The Home Secretary has set out that vital security checks will continue on all cases but these changes allow us to simplify the system and accelerate the process for Ukrainians eligible to come over to the UK safely.

"So, as I say, we will continue to ensure that safety is a priority but we've been able to introduce a system that will allow us to facilitate more Ukrainians who are in need of coming to the UK quicker."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said there should no "nowhere to hide" for individuals close to Vladimir Putin's regime.

Speaking to CNN in the US, she said: "We went through a period after the Cold War where we all thought that peace would be inevitable, that we could reduce defence spending, that we could focus on growing our economies. We became dependent on authoritarian regimes.

"If you look at Europe and our dependence on Russian oil and gas, that has been a huge problem. So, what we need to do now is completely change our approach.

"That's why we put in place (these) tough sanctions, and today I've announced that we're sanctioning Roman Abramovich as well as other major oligarchs close to the Putin regime.

"We need to take this head on, (there) can be nowhere to hide for these individuals. We cannot carry on with business as usual, as we have been doing for the past 20 years."

Liz Truss said the UK "absolutely" believes war crimes have been committed in Ukraine.

The Foreign Secretary said this called for a "tough international response".

Speaking to CNN in the US, she said: "We absolutely believe that war crimes are being committed. We've referred the case to the International Criminal Court, along with 37 other nations."

She added: "This is why we need such a tough international response ... We are doubling down on our sanctions, being tough on banks, (we're) putting in place (an) elimination of oil from Russia into the United Kingdom.

"But we need to do more with our allies because Putin has to lose in Ukraine. That is vitally important. And it's just appalling, the suffering we're seeing on the streets of Ukraine."

Liz Truss said "we cannot trust a word" from Russia, as "they're now claiming there isn't a war".

Asked if it would be helpful for the US to join the UK in saying war crimes had been committed in Ukraine, the Foreign Secretary told CNN: "We're working with all of our allies, including the United States, on this issue.

"But what we can see is appalling atrocities taking place. There is now talk of the use of chemical weapons. We've seen Russia do that before. And we're determined to call Russia out for this appalling invasion.

"We warned against it taking place. The Russians said they had no plans to invade, they're now claiming there isn't a war. We cannot trust a word they say. And we strongly believe there is evidence that appalling crimes are taking place and we are doing all we can to collect that evidence."

Boris Johnson defended the "very careful" approach to imposing sanctions.

The Prime Minister told reporters: "The right to property is something that English law, UK law takes very seriously.

"You have got to go through due process."

The Economic Crime Bill would allow the process to be accelerated, he said.

"You have got to have clear evidence that people are connected to the Putin regime, that has been established, that's why we are going ahead with the sanctions that we are."

Boris Johnson said there was "enough of a link" between the Putin regime and the fresh round of oligarchs to be sanctioned, in a list including Roman Abramovich, to take action against them.

The Prime Minister told broadcasters: "I can't comment on what individuals are doing but what we've concluded is that there is enough connection, enough of the link between the Putin regime and the individuals in question, to justify the action.

"I think when you look at what is happening in Ukraine, and you look to the casual rejection of every norm of civilised behaviour in bombing a maternity hospital, I think people in this country, I can see that people connected to the Putin regime need to be sanctioned, and that's what we're doing."

Boris Johnson said he will continue to "tighten the economic vice around the Putin regime" with further sanctions in the future.

The Prime Minister told broadcasters: "We've taken the powers to do that and, certainly, you can expect to see that.

"You can also expect to see the UK, again, leading in conversations with our friends and partners around the world to make sure that as Putin doubles down in violence against the Ukrainian people, we in the rest of the world, we who condemn his behaviour, work together to tighten the economic vice around the Putin regime, and that's what we're going to do."

Liz Truss said it would be a "grave mistake" for Russia to use chemical weapons.

Asked if the use of such weapons would be a "red line" for the UK, and how it would respond in that situation, the Foreign Secretary told CNN: "We are very concerned about the potential use of chemical weapons.

"Now, of course, we've seen Russia use these weapons before in fields of conflict, but that would be a grave mistake on the part of Russia, adding to the grave mistakes that have already been made by Putin."

Boris Johnson has warned British troops who go AWOL to fight against the Russian invasion of Ukraine will face court martial on their return to the UK.

Asked about a 19-year-old from Warrington said to have travelled to Ukraine to fight Russia, the Prime Minister told broadcasters: "I think that everybody seeing what's happening in Ukraine will understand those feelings and I think many people, many people in our armed forces, will sympathise because I don't think I've ever seen such clear distinction in international affairs between right and wrong and good and evil in what President Putin is doing to people in Ukraine.

"But we have very clear laws in this country. You shouldn't go to Ukraine, and I'm afraid people going from our armed services, as the Chief of the Defence Staff made clear the other day, will face court martial."

Liz Truss said the imposition of a no-fly zone, "however limited", over the skies of Ukraine would bring Nato into "direct conflict" with Russia.

Asked if Britain could support a "limited" no-fly zone with "a very narrowly defined humanitarian mission", she told CNN: "The issue ... with a no-fly zone is that would bring Nato into direct conflict with Russia, however limited that no-fly zone is.

"What our view is, is the best way to help the Ukrainians with their air defence is to supply equipment like the Starstreak, which we are supplying to the Ukrainians.

"That will help Ukraine defend their own country, it will help them defend their skies, but it won't bring Nato into the conflict."

Boris Johnson insisted the visa scheme was as "light touch" as possible but stressed the need for security checks on people fleeing Ukraine.

The Prime Minister told reporters: "I think people do understand that when you have got large numbers of people leaving from a war zone - some of them still armed, perhaps not all of their identities completely clear, their motivations completely clear - it is responsible to have checks."

Asked about the UK being behind other European countries in accepting Ukrainians, Mr Johnson said: "I think the UK has got an outstanding record of accepting vulnerable people fleeing from war zones.

"I think we have done more since 2015 to settle vulnerable people than any other country."

He said "more than a thousand" visas had been granted by Wednesday and the numbers "are going to climb very steeply".

"That reflects the generosity of the British people," he said.

"We are going to want to welcome Ukrainians fleeing the war zone."

(Corrected repetition, amending UN source in par 2 - first ran at 1339)

Western officials have described the refugee situation in Ukraine as "unprecedented", with concerns the total number of people fleeing could reach four million within days.

One official said: "The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) briefed us and others who are leading donors just last night.

"As of then, their number of refugees had topped two million - they are at 2.2 million as of last night - but they are worried we could see four million over the next few days.

"These are unprecedented movements of people in Europe, or indeed probably anywhere else in the world."

The official added: "I would like to stress the sheer scale of this, which is something that we haven't seen, certainly since the end of the Second World War, and that is a real challenge to us all."

Ukrainian refugees are turning up with frostbite due to the cold and some have mental health scars after facing bombardment, according to Western officials.

One official said: "What we're seeing is with the refugees now and the IDPs (internally displaced persons), you're getting simple things like frostbite because people are walking.

"You're getting things like women who can't get access to maternal healthcare, you're getting people needing mental health support because they've just come from areas that have been targeted and bombed.

"So, the needs are going to keep shifting."

The official said there was a "change in the profile" of refugees turning up at the borders of neighbouring countries, adding: "The first wave of refugees were very quickly moving on because these were people with resources, they had contacts elsewhere, so they came and they moved.

"In the second wave we were starting to see these people who are very traumatised, they left without any resources, they are very vulnerable and they need more direct support."

Another official said those turning up more recently were the "more infirm, for example the elderly, the grandparents who people have left behind because they are not able to move around very easily".

Jonathan Powell, former chief of staff to Tony Blair, said the West would need to "think very seriously" about its next steps if Russia deployed chemical weapons.

He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: "I think that's what the West needs to think about, particularly the US needs to think about, very hard - if Putin were to use a tactical nuclear weapon or chemical weapons in Ukraine, would that be a red line crossed, and would we have to act?

"Remember we faced this issue in Syria where ... (Bashar Assad) used chemical weapons ... with, of course, Russian support. We said we were going to act and then we didn't act.

"I think that would be catastrophic in terms of appeasement to Putin and ending up in a situation where he'll keep taking further action. So, I think we need to be clear about what our red lines are."

He added: "I understand why we're not getting dragged into the third world war ... which is why I say we need to offer a way out ... for Putin if he is prepared to take it. But if he crosses one of these red lines, a tactical nuclear weapon, or chemical weapons, I think we should think very seriously indeed if that is a red line for us and we're going to act.

"Because, otherwise, we simply get escalation and more escalation ... and then we are going to have to deal with it when we're in a worse situation."

Meeting Royal Navy officers on HMS Dauntless, which is undergoing a refit at Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead, Merseyside, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: "Circumstances have changed quite a lot, probably, since your refit began and we are going to need you out there doing a lot of stuff as fast as possible.

"There are operations that we are going to be ramping up, as you know, on the eastern front of Nato."

He thanked commanding officer Ben Power, who told him: "We will be there."

Mr Johnson was joined by Defence Secretary Ben Wallace for the visit.

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the UK and Nato allies "would seriously have to consider what we next did" in the event Russia used chemical weapons.

Sir Ed told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme: "I was really taken by what Jonathan Powell (former chief of staff to Tony Blair)... was saying just earlier on your programme - that if the Russians, if Putin's regime, used chemical weapons, or used tactical nuclear weapons, I think the UK with our Nato allies would seriously have to consider what we next did.

"We'd certainly have to start sanctioning more widely to those sorts of countries who are working with Russia and still supplying them with goods that could be used for weapons. We'd certainly have to decide whether or not we take further action."

Pressed on whether there is a point at which the situation gets so bad in Ukraine the UK has to intervene, he said: "I was in the Cabinet when we had to take the decision with our American colleagues to attack (Bashar) Assad in Syria when he used chemical weapons. I was very disappointed when Parliament rejected that.

"But we went about it in a very sober way, consulting with colleagues, looking at the action and looking at what the implication would be. So I think that would be the right course of action. We'd certainly have to consider it."

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has condemned a tweet from the Russian embassy in the UK which claimed the maternity hospital bombed in Ukraine was "long non-operational".

Ms Dorries tweeted "This is fake news. Reported via @DCMS" in relation to a statement from Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov which was included in a tweet from the Russian embassy.

The tweet from @RussianEmbassy read: "FM £Lavrov on the £Mariupol attack: The maternity house was long non-operational. Instead, it was used by (Ukrainian) armed forces and radicals, namely the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion.

"Moreover, £Russia warned £UN Security Council about this 3 days ago."

Russian claims that Ukrainians are their "brothers and sisters" have been rejected by Liberal Democrat former leader Lord Campbell of Pittenweem, who said it was "a very curious affection which relies on cruise missiles, helicopter gunships and artillery shells".

Speaking at Westminster, the peer said: "The targeting of civilians, of their homes and their refugees is most certainly barbaric. The bravery is the quite extraordinary fact that this nation against all odds has mobilised to face an enemy described... as being one with overwhelming firepower.

"This enemy targets the elderly, the vulnerable and the young. What sort of people attack a maternity hospital? Whether by design or carelessness, whether it was a bomb or it has been suggested artillery, it is still a war crime."

He added: "Russians claim the people of Ukraine are their brothers and sisters. A very curious affection which relies on cruise missiles, helicopter gunships and artillery shells."

Defence minister Baroness Goldie said: "By launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine, President Putin has chosen this path of bloodshed and destruction, barbarism and butchery.

"That's what has to be resisted. We cannot allow that evil to remain unchallenged."

She added: "I think all of us are full of admiration for the quite extraordinary resilience the people of Ukraine are showing."

Ministers are keeping tight-lipped on details of training Ukrainian forces following the decision to send more weapons to the Kyiv government to help in its defensive effort against Russia's invasion.

As well as anti-tank weapons, the Government is considering supplying Starstreak high-velocity manned portable anti-air missiles.

Speaking in Parliament, Labour peer Lord Anderson of Swansea said: "Quite rightly we have decided to give sophisticated weaponry to Ukraine. That surely needs very good training.

"Where will this training be done? Outside the borders of Ukraine?"

Defence minister Baroness Goldie said: "Yes, there will be a degree of training required and he will understand that for reasons of operational discretion I am not going to be more explicit about that."

Tory peer Lord Cormack highlighted the emotional address given by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to MPs in which he invoked British war leader Sir Winston Churchill, vowing to fight invading Russian troops in the air, sea and on the streets.

He said: "Can I suggest that Parliament, both Houses, should nominate President Zelensky for the Nobel Peace Prize?"

Lady Goldie said: "I am sure we are all conscious of the extraordinary attributes of President Zelensky and everyone will be reflecting how we best acknowledge that."

Another processing centre will open in Arras for Ukrainian refugees seeking to come to the UK.

The British consular post was being set up at the prefecture of the Pas-de-Calais region in Arras in northern France, the prefecture said in a statement on Thursday.

It is understood the latest visa application centre to open - just under 70 miles from Calais - will only handle the cases of people who have been referred there and is anticipated to operate along similar lines of a small "pop-up" site now established in Lille.

Downing Street said a tweet from the Russian embassy in the UK claiming the maternity hospital bombed in Ukraine was no longer operational and that images had been faked was "disinformation".

A spokesman for the Prime Minister told reporters: "It is clear that this is further disinformation.

"You have seen the pictures of the people who were wounded during that attack, and you have seen what the Prime Minister said in his tweet yesterday."

The spokesman said he was "not aware" that the Foreign Office had held "specific conversations" about reprimanding the embassy for the social media post.

Asked whether Boris Johnson would like to see social media platforms shut down the Russian embassy's accounts, the spokesman replied: "That's obviously a matter for Twitter, but we've been clear that that is disinformation.

"You've seen the increase in the civilians that have been targeted and sadly wounded and killed on the basis of Russian attacks."

Boris Johnson has accused Russia of a "cynical, barbaric" attempt to justify the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine.

The Prime Minister said the Kremlin was preparing a "fake story" that there were chemical weapons being stored in the country to provide grounds for using them themselves.

"The stuff which you are hearing about chemical weapons is straight out of the Russian playbook," he told Sky News.

"They start saying that there are chemical weapons that are being stored by their opponents or by the Americans so that when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have a fake story ready to go.

"You have seen it in Syria, you saw it even in the UK. I just note that that is what they are already doing. It is a cynical, barbaric government I'm afraid."

The Walt Disney Company has announced it is taking steps to "pause all other businesses in Russia" following the invasion in Ukraine.

It comes one week after the company delayed the theatrical release of its films in Russia in response to the ongoing crisis.

In a statement, Disney said: "Last week, after Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, we announced that we were pausing the release of theatrical films in Russia and reviewing the rest of our businesses there.

"Given the unrelenting assault on Ukraine and the escalating humanitarian crisis, we are taking steps to pause all other businesses in Russia. This includes content and product licensing, Disney Cruise Line activities, National Geographic magazine and tours, local content productions and linear channels.

"Some of those business activities we can and will pause immediately. Others - such as linear channels and some content and product licensing -will take time given contractual complexities.

"Even as we pause these businesses, we remain committed to our dedicated colleagues in Russia, who will remain employed. And we continue to work with our NGO partners to provide urgent aid and other much-needed assistance to refugees."

Military assistance for Ukraine and the arrival of refugees and Nato troops were among the main topics discussed by Estonian media on 1-7 March.

War in Ukraine

The Estonian Ministry of Defence is hoping to provide Ukraine with additional military assistance, following the consignment of Javelin anti-tank missile systems which arrived there last week. The ministry's secretary-general, Kusti Salm, said: "We are trying to get all the paperwork needed done as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we cannot talk much about the details, in what order, how much, and how the supplies will be delivered. As of today we can say this much - that in this category, anti-personnel mines are an additional item, and many more are planned for delivery." (ERR, in Estonian, 28 Feb 22)

Russia's "barbaric military aggression" against Ukraine must stop and the free world is doing everything it can to support the Ukrainians, Prime Ministers Kaja Kallas and Boris Johnson agreed on 1 March. They agreed that Russia has become a pariah state and must be treated accordingly, it was said in a statement. Kallas said the "economic and political isolation of Putin's regime" is a shared goal of the two nations. "We have to do more to stop the Putin war machine and isolate the aggressor," she said, calling on countries around the world to do more, adding the priority is to ensure practical help reaches Ukraine as quickly as possible. Johnson and Kallas discussed defence cooperation and visited Tapa Military bases alongside Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. (Delfi, in Estonian, 1 Mar 22)

Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said she did not recommend that Estonians volunteer to fight in Ukraine. People who fight for Belarus or Russia face five years in jail. Speaking at the government's weekly press conference, Kallas spoke about Estonians who want to fight on the side of the Ukrainians against Russia. However, she said Estonians are also needed to defend Estonia. "I hope that first of all they still want to and can contribute to the defence of Estonia. We certainly do not give any recommendations to our people to go to war at the moment," she said. The prime minister said the government has agreed to ban people from Estonia or Estonians from joining the Belarusian or Russian forces. "This applies to all people staying in Estonia, but also to Estonian citizens abroad. Violation of this sanction is punishable by a fine or up to five years' imprisonment," said Kallas. (ERR, in Estonian, 3 Mar 22)

Nato has taken significant steps in making the cost of Russia's continued aggression against Ukraine 'intolerably high', though a no-fly zone around the country is not on the table at present, Foreign Minister Eva-Maria Liimets said. A no-fly zone will not be put in place over Ukrainian territory, the Nato ministers agreed at a meeting in Brussels. While Nato has more than 200 ships and 130 fighter jets on alert, these will not be used to create a no-fly zone, Jens Stoltenberg said. Liimets said the issue may be returned to if the allies' current measures do not work out. "Nato does not want to go to war with Russia, and therefore a solution in which Nato would provide air defence is not currently on the table. However, of course, we should raise this question again, if our other decisions and solutions do not help," Liimets said. (ERR, in Estonian, 4 Mar 22)

Refugees

Almost 100 people who have fled the war in Ukraine arrived in Estonia on 28 February by bus from the Polish-Ukrainian border. The majority have come to stay with friends or family members already living in Estonia, according to the Ministry of the Interior. Those without relatives will stay in Tallinn. Minister of the Interior Kristjan Jaani said the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) have been communicating with and offering assistance to 270 Ukrainian citizens who have entered Estonia over the last two days. "Among them are those who are already living in Estonia, Ukrainians passing through Estonia and also war refugees who want to stay here temporarily," he said. The Social Insurance Board is providing round-the-clock psychological support while Tallinn is funding the first few nights of emergency accommodation. Madle Timm, communications manager at the Estonian Refugee Council, said more buses will depart for the Polish-Ukrainian border in the coming days. (ERR, in Estonian, 28 Feb 22)

Ukrainian war refugees who reach Estonia on their own are eligible for health checks in Estonian family medical centres. While Estonia only has free healthcare for those with health insurance, an exception will be made for people fleeing the war in Ukraine. "Primary health checks will be offered on location for persons who reach a designated accommodation establishment. Emergency medical care teams tasked with this are standing by," Marko Tahnas of Estonian Health Insurance Fund said. "Ideally, every refugee should get a health check within a week of arriving in Estonia. This should include an appointment with a family doctor or nurse, bloodwork and certain viral markers," he explained. Tahnas said it is important to know that refugees' visits to the doctor are financed separately and in no way impact Estonians' access to healthcare services. (ERR, in Estonian, 6 Mar 22)

Some 77% of all Estonian residents, including 91% of Estonians, support the idea of accepting Ukrainian refugees if necessary, a recent survey commissioned by the Government Office showed. The results of the survey indicated that 91% of ethnic Estonian respondents support the country accepting war refugees from Ukraine. Support among non-Estonians, meanwhile, stood at 48%. Some 58% of respondents find that Russia's attempts to restore its influence in neighbouring countries threaten Estonia as well, including 73% of ethnic Estonians and 27% of non-Estonian respondents. Meanwhile, just 36% of respondents have concerns that ethnically or religiously motivated clashes between population groups may occur within Estonia. Respondents were also surveyed regarding which media channels people trust regarding their coverage of the war in Ukraine. Among ethnic Estonians, 88% trust Estonian media coverage, 66% trust Western media coverage, 54% trust Ukrainian media coverage and just 3% trust Russian media coverage of the war. Among non-Estonians, 34% trust Estonian media coverage, 22% trust Western media coverage, 13% trust Ukrainian coverage and 34% trust Russian media coverage of the war. In a previous poll conducted two weeks earlier, 40% of non-Estonian respondents trusted Russian media coverage. (ERR, in Estonian, 7 Mar 22)

Nato

On 1 March, a ferry docked at the Port of Paldiski carrying a delivery of allied vehicles and equipment that had arrived to reinforce Nato battlegroup Estonia. Over the next week, British and Danish troops slated to begin serving in the battlegroup will begin arriving in Estonia as well. More than 900 members of the Royal Welsh infantry regiment of the British Army and nearly 200 Danish troops together with their vehicles and equipment will be joining Nato cattlegroup Estonia at the Tapa army base. Once all units have arrived, the Royal Welsh will take over leadership of the Estonian battlegroup and integrate into the 1st Infantry Brigade of the Estonian Defence Forces (EDF). The Royal Tank Regiment, which has served in Estonia and led the battlegroup since last September, will remain at Tapa for a few more months, where it will focus on cooperation with the EDF's 1st and 2nd Infantry Brigades. (Delfi, in Estonian, 1 Mar 22)

While Nato has shifted from a deterrence to a defence posture, this does not mean that Estonia, for example, is now under direct threat by Russia; rather, it means that preparations are under way in case an actual threat should materialize, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said. "This means that the alliance is working toward being prepared to defend Nato territory," Kallas said. "This does not mean that there is a direct threat at our borders. But we must be prepared for this, and for short-term scenarios. And know that our allies are prepared to defend us." According to the prime minister, allies at a recent Nato summit each offered what they are prepared to do to strengthen the alliance's eastern flank. Kallas added that she spoke with US Vice President Kamala Harris, who confirmed that the USA is sending additional resources to both the Ukraine and the EU. (ERR, in Estonian, 1 Mar 22)

Drill

The Estonian leg of Operation Saber Strike began at the Central Training Area and on the northern coast of Estonia on Monday, where American, British, Finnish and Estonian units will be exercising air defence together. "During Saber Strike, we are conducting air and missile defence training with our Nato allies," US Army Col Patrick Thompson, commander of the 164th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, said according to a Ministry of Defence press release. "This training helps build interoperability between our Nato allies and our partners." Participating in the Estonian leg of the exercise are the Helsinki Air Defence Regiment, American, British and Estonian air defence units, Belgian, British and Polish fighters as well as Estonian Aero L-39 Albatros training jets and a PZL M28 Skytruck. "This is the first time Estonian air defense will lead a complex exercise incorporating middle and short range air defence systems and the communications systems of different countries supported by air assets," said Lt-Col Tanel Lelov, commanding officer of Estonia's Air Defence Battalion. "Saber Strike will test the readiness of our command and control systems as well as our skills and knowledge." (Postimees, in Estonian, 7 Mar 22)

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) says Russia's advance in Ukraine has been stymied...

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) says Russia's advance in Ukraine has been stymied by a lack of manoeuvrability, which has been "adeptly exploited" by the Ukrainian forces.

In its latest defence intelligence update, the MoD wrote on Twitter: "Russian forces are struggling to overcome the challenges posed by Ukraine's terrain.

"Russian forces have remained largely tied to Ukraine's road network and have demonstrated a reluctance to conduct off-road manoeuvre. The destruction of bridges by Ukrainian forces has also played a key role in stalling Russia's advance.

"Russia's continued failure to gain control of the air has drastically limited their ability to effectively use air manoeuvre, further limiting their options.

"The tactics of the Ukrainian armed forces have adeptly exploited Russia's lack of manoeuvre, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on the invading forces."

Boris Johnson said there is "no way Ukraine is going to join Nato anytime soon" but stressed that the decision had to be for the country's president to take.

Speaking to broadcasters at the Emirates Palace hotel in Abu Dhabi, the Prime Minister said: "I talked to Volodymyr (Zelensky) again yesterday and of course I understand what he is saying about Nato and the reality of the position.

"And everybody has always said - and we've made it clear to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin - that there is no way Ukraine is going to join Nato anytime soon.

"But the decision about the future of Ukraine has got to be for the Ukrainian people, and Volodymyr Zelensky is their elected leader and we will back him.

"And the most important thing is that Putin's aggression, his absolutely barbaric attacks on Ukraine should stop and they should not be seen to have succeeded, and they won't succeed."

The Foreign Secretary said sanctions from the UK and other western nations were having a "debilitating affect on the Russian economy" but urged allies to go further.

Liz Truss, speaking to Sky News, said: "What we know is that Vladimir Putin's plans are not going according to plan.

"He is not making the progress expected, and we know the sanctions we've put on are working.

"They are having a debilitating affect on the Russian economy.... Those sanctions are really beginning to bite."

Ms Truss said further British sanctions should be expected, saying "we've got more individuals on our list" as well as companies to target, but called for allies to do more.

She noted that the European Union had sanctioned three Russian banks compared with the UK and US targeting 10 major banks, and said "we'd like to see them sanction even more banks", while also arguing that more sanctions could come "collectively" from the 141 countries that voted against Russia at the UN General Assembly.

Liz Truss said there was no guarantee sanctioned oligarchs like Roman Abramovich would be free to return to the UK after the Russian war with Ukraine ends.

The Foreign Secretary also said she did not think the conflict was "near the end", in comments made on Sky News.

Put to her that Mr Abramovich could return once Russian troops had withdrawn, Ms Truss said: "No, I haven't said that.

"Because I'm saying even if the war was to end - and I fear we are not near the end, at this stage - huge devastation has been caused, lives have been lost as a result of this war.

"And there will need to be a reckoning with all the people who supported Putin, including Abramovich."

She said the UK was working with allies "in the G7 and beyond" to ensure oligarchs have "nowhere where it is legitimate for them to live their lifestyles, have their yachts or have their planes".

The former head of MI6 said that only China can influence Putin to stop his invasion into Ukraine.

Sir Alex Younger, former head of the Secret Intelligence Service from 2014 to 2020, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Of all the people in the world that can assert influence on Vladimir Putin, who is in his bunker and who is obsessed by achieving greatness through the restoration of the Russian Empire..., of all the people that can talk sense to him, it's Xi (Jinping, the Chinese leader).

"Vladimir Putin needs Xi and of course Xi while he feels he has to align himself at the high level with what Russia is doing because of their new alliance, must be deeply disturbed by what is going on."

He added that the situation in Ukraine is "seriously compounding the economic problems that China face" and carries a "huge reputational risk" for China if they continue to associate themselves with the "murderous activities in Ukraine".

He added: "Putin does not have a reverse gear. He gambled.

"He has hit extraordinary difficulties early on but he's going to keep going and he has to, because he went into this war with a false premise, and he needs to be seen to be bringing something back from it."

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said weapons from Western nations are still reaching Ukrainian forces.

He told reporters at Nato's headquarters in Brussels: "We are continuing to deliver weapons into Ukraine from many different directions and it is getting to the front line."

Asked about Poland's suggestion of a Nato peace mission to Ukraine, Mr Wallace said: "I think I'll look at the details first before I make any decisions about what happens.

"But it is absolutely the case that we have to continue to show - in action - our support to Ukraine and its freedoms and not just talk."

He added: "Coming here today, we should also remind ourselves how lucky we are. There is Ukraine, a country currently effectively under siege by an aggressive Russian armed forces - and that's why they wanted to join this alliance.

"I think we have to see what more we can do to give them that support."

Ukrainians are negotiating for peace with Russia with a "gun against their heads", according to the Foreign Secretary.

Liz Truss, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, said: "The first precursor to any successful peace talks has to be a ceasefire and Putin withdrawing his troops from Ukraine.

"It is very, very difficult for the Ukrainians to negotiate with a gun against their heads.

"And I am very, very concerned that Putin is playing a smoke-and-mirrors game of trying to claim that he is seeking peace while, at the same time, continuing with this appalling war he instigated and is not making the progress he thought he would."

Ms Truss said she thinks Nato membership for Ukraine is "not the real issue" and that it is a "smoke screen", arguing: "This is about recreating a greater Russia and essential subordinating Ukraine under Russian authority, as well as extending more broadly to other east European states.

"This is why it is so important we stop Putin in Ukraine, because it isn't just about Ukraine, it isn't just about Nato - it is about the desire to recreate the Soviet Union. He is clearly an extremely dangerous man."

The UK had "cumbersome" sanction legislation before changes were made this week, Liz Truss said.

Fielding questions on why Britain had taken longer than some of its allies to target individual wealthy Russians with Kremlin links, the Foreign Secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "The specific issue here is that we have - or had - some very cumbersome legislation.

"We essentially had unlimited damages if oligarchs sued us, so that made it very difficult for the Government to build the evidence cases against these oligarchs.

"Since the invasion took place, we've put through emergency legislation to cut out these huge damages, which means we've been able to now sanction more individuals and more entities than either the US or the EU."

Ms Truss said the changes made by the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act, which received royal assent on Tuesday, "eliminated" the "huge risk" of the UK Government having to pay "very high damages" to Russian elites contesting British sanctions.

Kevin Foster, Home Office minister for safe and legal migration, told the Commons Home Affairs Committee 5,500 visas have now been granted under the Ukraine Family Scheme and 20,000 applications have been submitted.

The Home Office website said these figures are as of 4pm on Tuesday.

Conservative MP Adam Holloway accused the Government of making it "extraordinarily difficult" for Ukrainian women and children to reach the UK, calling the situation "utterly farcical".

He told the Home Affairs Committee: "I don't know how many people crossed the Channel yesterday, but I wonder what criminal record checks or checks for war crimes were carried out on them? I mean, are we having a kind of a bit of a double standard?

"We're completely failing to stop what are essentially economic migrants, mostly fit young men, and yet we're making it incredibly difficult for women and children to come here with enormous reputational damage to a government is doing really well overall."

In response, Kevin Foster, Home Office minister for safe and legal migration, said people arriving from France are detained and have their biometrics taken, with some exceptions for unaccompanied children and families, and "are subject to the very checks you've just talked about".

Sir Keir Starmer has reiterated his comments that "going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is not an energy strategy" as Boris Johnson continues his visit to the Gulf.

Speaking to reporters in Huddersfield, the Labour leader said: "The Prime Minister says we can't rely on Russia, so now he goes to Saudi Arabia.

"We need to make sure we've got security for our energy and that means lessening our imports and not going cap in hand frankly, from dictator to dictator."

Asked whether he would visit the same region if he was Prime Minister, Sir Keir said: "I've got nothing against measures to try and bring prices down in the short term but Liz Truss was saying only the other day, we've got to stop relying on malign actors and that's why they want to wean us off Russia, but you can't do that and go cap in hand to Saudi Arabia.

"What we need is an energy strategy that has security, less imports, rely on renewables here, ramp up onshore and offshore wind, get nuclear going much more quickly and have retrofit like we're seeing here in Kirklees, so we drive down the need for energy in the first place."

He added: "If there's one lesson we've learned in the last few weeks and months, it's that we need to stop this reliance, dependency, on oil and gas from overseas, Russia in particular, but you don't do that by jumping from Russia to Saudi Arabia and recreating the exact same problem."

On Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's comment that the country would not join Nato, Sir Keir Starmer said: "President Zelensky has been leading from the front in a really courageous way in Ukraine and we were all moved when he addressed Parliament last week.

"Obviously, it's a matter for him how he negotiates.

"I am concerned that what we've seen here is Russia's aggression against the sovereignty of Ukraine and it's very important that we all stand up for the principles here, but as to the precise negotiations, that's a matter for him."

Sir Keir Starmer has told the Government to "up its game" in supporting Ukrainian refugees, calling their approach "too narrow, too slow and too mean".

The Labour leader told reporters in Huddersfield: "The British public have been incredibly welcoming and generous. They've given generously to various schemes to support refugees, a number of thousands of people have said they'll take a refugee - if only the Government actually matched the ambition of the British public, because their approach has been too narrow, too slow and too mean.

"What I want to see from the Government is a realistic package of support for refugees arriving here, who will be traumatised, many of them will have family back in Ukraine that they're desperately worried about, with all sorts of medical needs, schooling needs and work needs.

"So thank you to the British public for their generosity. 'Up your game' is my message to the Government in relation for what they're doing for refugees."

Sir Keir added: "I don't think the Government has put in place the underlying support that's needed. I don't think they've been talking to local leaders, local government, local housing providers because, in the end, what we learned from the Afghan refugees coming last summer is you need that support package, because you're dealing very traumatised people who do have needs which require specialist help and assistance.

"The generosity of the British public is exactly what I would have expected, it's fantastic, but the Government needs to match that now with putting that support in to make sure that this is a realistic and viable option, and not one that just collapses in on itself."

The Home Affairs Committee was told that local authorities will receive £10,500 per refugee for the first year to support Ukrainians through education, English language support, safeguarding and social care.

Under current plans the Government is not asking councils primarily to help with accommodation, as it intends to rely on the more than 120,000 people who have expressed interest so far under the Homes For Ukraine scheme.

Labour MP Clive Betts asked: "Isn't there a potential real problem there? That if there is a concentration of refugees coming to certain areas, where there may already be enormous pressure on things like child mental health, school places, that it will simply not be possible to give them the sorts of services they actually need?"

The Lord Harrington of Watford, minister for refugees, replied: "I'm not turning my mind to that yet... it's a very valid point and please don't think I'm fobbing you off, but for the moment we just have to get these people in."

He added: "We're going to have to - we're going to have to find school places and we're going to have to find extra social workers."

The refugee minister has told MPs he expects "thousands of people" to arrive next week under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme, but warned it "may not be possible" for all accommodation being offered to be checked beforehand.

Asked if checks will be carried out by councils on accommodation under the Homes for Ukraine scheme before Ukrainians are housed in the UK, Lord Richard Harrington told the Commons Home Affairs Committee: "It may not be possible.

"I mean, I'm talking next week ... I'm expecting thousands of people to come but it will be their responsibility and, particularly where there's a possibility of vulnerability with children, this sort of thing, that would take priority.

"But if we started saying we're going to preview it, it's just not possible."

Asked by the committee if he could give assurances that Ukrainian refugees will not be housed in hotels, he replied: "I honestly can't give you that undertaking. I'd like to but it's not our intention. But if all else fails, it's our duty to make sure they've got a roof over their head and they're fed properly.

"It's not our plan, it's not our strategy. We've got thousands of people from Afghanistan staying in hotels. We've got thousands of asylum seekers. So it's not the plan but I can't give you 100% assurance because I just don't know."

Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab, opening Prime Minister's Questions, told the Commons: "I understand that four members of the Ukrainian parliament are here with us in the gallery today and I'm sure I speak for the whole House in saying that we stand in total solidarity with you."

Conservative MP Dean Russell (Watford) raised concerns over the Gambling Commission announcing that Czech operator Allwyn, owned by Czech businessman Karel Komarek and previously known as Sazka Entertainment, was its "preferred applicant" to run the National Lottery when Camelot's licence expires in 2024.

Mr Russell, who noted Camelot is a major employer in his constituency, told the Commons: "I do wonder, given the current situation in Ukraine, if (Mr Raab) considers it appropriate that the next licensee of the operator of the National Lottery is known to have a joint venture with Gazprom?"

Mr Raab replied: "I understand that Allwyn's owner Mr Komarek, who has long criticised the Putin regime, is in discussions with the Czech Republic government regarding the joint venture with Gazprom and removing its involvement."

People who have registered interest under the Homes For Ukraine scheme who have identified someone they can sponsor will be able to apply from Friday, the Home Affairs Committee heard.

MPs were told that there are lots of informal networks and charities which are identifying people and helping match them with sponsors.

Conservative MP Tim Loughton called for regular updates for the public about progress, "otherwise people will get very frustrated, as they did in some of the volunteering schemes in the pandemic signed up, and then they never got called on to do anything".

Lord Harrington of Watford, minister for refugees, replied: "I'm doing my best to make sure that does not happen... I want it to work. I believe when it works through, the real conduit for this will be those NGOs on the ground, and they'll become expert at it."

Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner pushed the Deputy Prime Minister on the appointment of Lord Lebedev to the House of Lords.

She said: "The right honourable member was foreign secretary on March 17 2020 when British intelligence reportedly warned against the granting of peerage to the Prime Minister's close friend and now Lord Lebedev of Hampton and Siberia. Forty-eight hours later the Prime Minister visited Lebedev at his home in London; details of that meeting have never been released.

"In July 2020 Lebedev's appointment as peer was announced. So can he tell the House what changed between the security warning and the appointment?"

Mr Raab said: "The honourable lady knows full well all individuals nominated for a peerage are done so in recognition of what their contribution is to society. And I should say, that includes those of Russian origin who contribute brilliantly to our nation, many of whom in this country are critics of the Putin regime.

"Life peerages are vetted by the House of Lords' appointments commission for matters of probity and frankly I think she should know better."

Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner pressed Dominic Raab on whether he has ever "overruled or ignored" direct advice from the British security services.

Ms Rayner said: "I'd like to thank all of the people who have been working tirelessly to bring British nationals home from Iran, our diplomatic staff, and our world leading British intelligence agencies.

"The role of the British intelligence today is critical in the face of Putin's aggression. The Deputy Prime Minister oversaw our foreign intelligence services as foreign secretary. So, can he confirm if at any time he overruled or ignored direct advice from the British security services?"

Mr Raab replied: "Can I say to the honourable lady, what she suggests is nonsense. She's talking about the House of Lords Appointments Commission. They have a vetting process. I have never overruled intelligence advice and I wouldn't comment on the details of it.

"What I would say, and would agree with her on the strength, the agility of the British diplomatic service, which time and time again, are the unsung heroes in returning British nationals - often less celebrated cases than this - but I think now is a great opportunity to recognise the heroic work they do."

Tory MP Adam Holloway asked if taxpayers' money will be used to fund the stay in the UK of working-age men who the Ukrainian government expect to remain and defend the country.

Lord Harrington of Watford, minister for refugees, said the UK cannot run a humanitarian mission and bar such men.

He told the Home Affairs Committee: "This is a mass movement of people. And the Ukrainian government will advise us on what they want to do, but just because they're there in Poland, doesn't mean they're deserters. I mean, there'll be all sorts of reasons for it.

"So I'm afraid it's not a satisfactory answer, but we can't start being the police officer for the Ukrainian government, and they've got enough problems on their mind to do it."

(corrected repetition, amends question number in par 2. First ran at 1231)

Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said Labour would put security at risk.

Responding to Angela Rayner's fourth question in the Commons, he said: "The suggestion she's making is sheer nonsense. But if she wants to talk about national security then I remind her that she and her shadow cabinet colleagues not so long ago wanted the honourable member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)... a man who wanted and talked about abolishing the Army, pulling out of Trident - she voted for that.

"Has there ever been a more ridiculous, reckless, naive moment to call for unilateral nuclear disarmament and pulling out of Nato?

"A Labour government would put at risk our security. We're doing everything we can to protect it."

Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner asked in the Commons if the Prime Minister "ever asked anyone to urge the security services to revise, reconsider or withdraw their assessment of Lord Lebedev of Hampton and Siberia".

Asking her fourth question during Prime Minister's Questions with Dominic Raab, she said: "What I do know better is the central duty of any Government is to keep the British people safe. There are now widespread reports that the Prime Minister did not accept warnings from our own intelligence services, granting a Russian oligarch, the son and business partner of a KGB spy, a seat here in this Parliament.

"It shouldn't matter if such a warning was about a close personal friend of the Prime Minister. It shouldn't matter if he gave the Prime Minister thousands of pounds of gifts. And it shouldn't matter how much champagne and caviar he serves.

"There is no ifs or buts when it comes to the safety of the British people. So I ask the Deputy Prime Minister, can he guarantee that the Prime Minister never asked anyone to urge the security services to revise, reconsider or withdraw their assessment of Lord Lebedev of Hampton and Siberia?"

Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner accused the Government of going "cap in hand from one dictator to another" by asking Saudi Arabia to produce more oil following the move to divest from Russian fossil fuels.

After facing heckles from the Government benches and a call for order by Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle at Deputy Prime Minister's Questions, the deputy leader of the opposition added: "The Government benches have a choice - they can accept Labour's plan to save working families hundreds of pounds on bills funded by a one-off levy on the soaring profits of energy companies.

"So I ask the Deputy Prime Minister - is their only plan to keep on begging?"

Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab replied: "Can I just gently say to her that when she was campaigning as the rest of them were to make the member of Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn) prime minister, this Prime Minister was foreign secretary, leading the response to the nerve agent attack on Salisbury."

After further calls for order for the Commons Speaker, Mr Raab added that Jeremy Corbyn had "sided with Putin" in the past, and quoted Ms Rayner's past words that Mr Corbyn was a "very strong leader" and could not wait for him to become Prime Minister.

The Government has led the way on Russian sanctions and by providing a "big-hearted response" to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, Dominic Raab has said.

Asking her final question during Prime Minister's Questions, Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said: "There is a war in Europe. There is a fuel energy crisis in Britain. Democracy is at risk. We must support the courageous efforts of President Zelensky and the Ukrainian people.

"These uncertain times require leadership with integrity. A leader that works with the security services, can be trusted to say the right thing for British diplomacy and provide security to the British people.

"Instead we have got this sorry excuse of a Government that is before us."

She accused the Government of "partying during lockdown" adding: "Can the Deputy Prime Minister look the British people in the eye and say this Government is doing their best?

Mr Raab replied that the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary had shown leadership with the "impact of the sanctions and the diplomatic effort" which had let to the "rouble plummeting".

He added: "We have also shown the big-hearted spirit of this Government and indeed this nation", by processing visas for Ukrainians and with the new humanitarian sponsorship scheme.

Conservative Claire Coutinho (East Surrey) called for recognition for service personnel for their role in "working with the Ukrainian armed forces in helping to shore up the eastern flank of Nato".

Speaking during PMQs, she said: "British servicemen and women have served under Operations Cabrit and Orbital since 2015 working with the Ukrainian armed forces in helping to shore up the eastern flank of Nato, which is now more important than ever.

"Would the Deputy Prime Minister join with me in putting on the record the gratitude of this House and consider what recognition we can give them for their service and for their role in history?"

Dominic Raab replied: "She's absolutely right. She's totally right to pay tribute to the professionalism, the dedication, the sacrifice of our armed service men and women every day to defend this country.

"She'll know that recognition for all military operations is kept under continuous review and I know that the Defence Secretary will have heard her very compelling suggestions."

It remains Ukraine's "absolute right" as a "free nation" to apply for Nato membership in the future, Conservative former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith has said.

Sir Iain told the Commons: "Can I ask my right honourable friend that as the brilliant Ukrainian people fight and die on a daily basis for their rights of freedom and democracy, it's important therefore that we make something very clear and I wonder if he would do this.

"They have asked for membership of Nato for a significant period and Nato has chosen not to give it to them. My concern now is no matter what they decide, it remains their absolute right as a free nation and a free people to make such an application in the future, and noticing that Finland is talking about being a member, that we treat them in exactly the same way as we would an application from Finland."

Dominic Raab replied: "He will have heard what President Zelensky has said overnight in relation to this. But one of the things that we have always been crystal clear as a Government is that if there is a diplomatic offer and, I have to say we have a heavy measure of scepticism about whether Putin could ever fulfil such a deal, but if there is, it has to be done with the will and volition of the Ukrainian President and the Ukrainian people."

Dominic Raab told MPs the "Prime Minister is not just a very social individual" as a Labour MP asked him "what first attracted the Prime Minister to the billionaire Russian oligarchs?"

Speaking at PMQs, Labour's Matt Western (Warwick and Leamington) said: "I'm sure the Deputy Prime Minister will agree with me that when it comes to judging a person, it's often done by the company that they keep."

To laughter from some MPs in the Commons, Mr Western added: "Can he therefore tell us what first attracted the Prime Minister to the billionaire Russian oligarchs?"

Mr Raab replied: "I wasn't quite sure where he was going at the beginning of his question, but what I can tell him - the Prime Minister is not just a very social individual.

"He wants this country to be open, outward-looking to the world, but we were the Government and he was the Prime Minister and I was the foreign secretary that introduced the Magnitsky sanctions that put human rights sanctions, asset freezes and visa bans, not just on Russians where we have evidence of wrongdoing, but... many others. It was this Government, not the Labour Party."

Irish premier Micheal Martin has spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Mr Martin, who is in Washington for St Patrick's Day celebrations, tweeted: "I told him the Irish people stand fully behind Ukraine.

"He thanked us for our continued humanitarian aid, shelter, global support and sanctions against Russia.

"He offered sympathy to the family of journalist Pierre Zakrzewski."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that he had spoken to Irish premier Micheal Martin on Wednesday.

He tweeted: "Discussed countering aggression & horrific crimes of Russia against civilians."

Mr Zelensky said he offered his condolences over the death of Irish cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski, who was killed while working in Ukraine.

David Cameron called for a dedicated aid minister in the Cabinet as he said more could be done to support Ukraine with the humanitarian crisis.

The former prime minister was asked on Channel 4 News whether he would rule out putting a no-fly zone in place over Ukraine if he was in office, and said: "I'm afraid I would, you know, in our hearts, every shred of our being wants to do everything we can to help the Ukrainians in the struggle.

"And we are helping, we're helping with weapons, we're helping with training, we're helping with refugees. There's more we can do on humanitarian aid, but I think we have to be very clear with our friends and allies and people we care deeply about, we must be clear about what we can do. But I'm afraid we also have to be clear about what we can't do.

"That said, there are more things that we can do. Well, I think the process started under my premiership of sending more troops to frontline states in Nato, to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania. Let's turn some of those into permanent bases.

"Let's do more on humanitarian aid. We achieved 0.7% of GDP in our aid payments. I'm sad we've got away from that. I hope we can get back there.

"Let's with the EU lead the donor conference, lead the aid effort. Let's have a dedicated aid minister in the Cabinet doing development. The Foreign Office ministers do a great job, but it'd be good to have someone who's 100% dedicated to humanitarian aid and development."

Former prime minister David Cameron said he regrets the "feeble" western response to Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008.

Mr Cameron was asked on Channel 4 News whether he regretted his involvement with Russia, including a speech at the State University of Moscow in 2011 where he said Britain and Russia would be "stronger together".

He said: "What I regret is in 2008, when I was leader of the opposition, when Russia effectively invaded Georgia, I went to Tbilisi to show solidarity with President Saakashvili. And if you look at the western response to Georgia, it was feeble, there weren't sanctions, there wasn't pressure put in place.

"We should have done that in 2008 and we did behave differently in 2012 when Putin invaded Crimea, in 2014."

He said by 2014 the UK was leading the effort on sanctions, adding: "When I think back to that time, you know, we were trying to persuade... I mean, the French at that stage were selling warships to the Russians."

He said when he entered No 10 "there was a sense that, look, you had to try and find a way of working with these people".

"We had to work together over terrorism, we had to work together over climate change. We had to work together over banking regulations," he said.

"I thought we had to do business with Russia and its leadership, which at that time was more (Dmitry) Medvedev than Putin."

David Cameron defended the Conservative Party receiving money from Russian donors.

The former prime minister told Channel 4 News: "If the argument is that somehow Russian investment in Britain, or very small numbers of Russians supporting the Conservative Party, somehow changed our policy, I would say that it's complete nonsense."

He refused to be drawn on accusations against Boris Johnson regarding the elevation of Evgeny Lebedev to the House of Lords.

Mr Cameron said: "Look, that's for the Prime Minister to explain and to defend.

"The Lords Appointments Commission is an important body. I always listened to it very carefully. But I'm not here to start throwing bricks at the Prime Minister at this moment."

Refugee minister Lord Harrington, answering questions from peers about the Ukrainian sponsorship scheme, said: "When I was offered the job by the Prime Minister the only criteria I was given was in fact a security one; it's my job to make sure it's done as quickly as possible and as humanely as possible."

The Conservative peer stressed the importance of protecting national security, adding: "But that doesn't mean we're obsessed by it."

Lord Harrington said the Home Office team has more than 100 people and will be "double that by the weekend", adding of the application assessment process: "I've set the target of 24 hours - it may be more if they're so overwhelmed by it but I expect it to come down and down.

"The only reason for that delay is so that we can... it really boils down to criminal record checks from all the databases they've got, it's not more complex than that."

PM tells Ukrainian ambassador Estonia's support to Ukraine is steadfast

TALLINN, Mar 18, BNS - Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas reaffirmed on Friday to Ukrainian ambassador to Estonia Mariana Betsa that Estonia's support to Ukraine is steadfast.

Kallas told Betsa that Estonia will continue supporting Ukraine with defense-related and humanitarian aid, spokespeople for the government said.

"Defense aid to Ukraine is the most important thing if we want to see Putin lose this war," Kallas said. The prime minister added that Estonia was among the first states to send military aid to Ukraine.

"We did it in cooperation with the United States, United Kingdom, Latvia and Lithuania even before the outbreak of a large-scale war," she said.

Considering the ratios, Estonia is among the greatest supporters of Ukraine. Estonia has just dispatched seven ambulances, one million euros' worth of pharmaceutical aid and several tons of food aid to Ukraine. In total, Estonia has provided close to 2,000 tons of various types of aid to Ukraine. Over 10 million euros' worth of civilian aid has been handed over to Ukraine in state aid and private donations. A headquarters for coordinating humanitarian aid for Ukraine has been established in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Kallas and Betsa also discussed how to support the close to 19,000 Ukrainian war refugees in Estonia.

"I am very proud of the Estonian people, seeing how Ukrainians are being helped with open hearts. Now it is essential to help refugees adapt to the Estonian society and language space and find a place for themselves here to ensure they can cope independently. Just physical safety is not enough because people need a place to live and work in, places in schools and kindergartens as well as health care and other services. It is a great responsibility and challenge for the Estonian state because war refugees already account for more than 1 percent of the Estonian population.

Kallas said that Estonia together with its allies is taking action to further increase the price of the aggression for Putin's criminal regime and to cut funding for his war machine.

"A fourth package of sanction by the EU has just stepped into effect and work on another one is underway. We will continue to isolate Putin's regime economically and politically," the prime minister said. She highlighted Russia having been expelled from the Council of Europe and the International Court of Justice having ordered Russia to cease its hostilities immediately.

"These decisions show that the aggressor has no place among us and that war crimes must no go unpunished. Putin cannot be allowed to develop a sense of impunity," Kallas said.

Kallas also met on Friday morning with the Estonian ambassador to Ukraine Kaimo Kuusk with whom she likewise discussed how to continue comprehensively assisting Ukraine. The prime minister lauded the staff of the Estonian embassy who have bravely continued supporting Ukraine since the outbreak of the large-scale war. The premier noted that Estonia has made weighty diplomatic efforts to comprehensively support Ukraine.

Financial sanctions applied 83 times in Estonia in 1st month of war

TALLINN, Mar 24, BNS – As of the evening of March 23, 83 notifications had been submitted to the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) regarding the freezing of assets and the rejection or non-execution of transactions on the basis of established financial sanctions.

Approximately half of the notifications of the application of international financial sanctions have come from banks. Other notifying parties have been predominantly public authorities, investment funds and companies, lawyers, notaries, private companies and other notifying parties, the FIU said.

The primary statutory task of the FIU is to verify the legality of financial sanctions already in place. In addition, attention is drawn to situations where financial sanctions have not been applied, but the FIU believes that they should be applied. According to the FIU, such analysis and drawing of attention is time-consuming, as there are a number of situations throughout the country where the application of a financial sanction could take place and the FIU receives information on these non-applications also gradually.

The legality of the applied measures is assessed by the Financial Intelligence Unit on a daily basis. To date, the legality of approximately half of the applications has been confirmed. "The size and content of transactions increase over time according to how new financial sanctions are implemented, applied and how inspection of them is carried out. The European Union is also known to be preparing another package of sanctions," Matis Maeker, head of the FIU, said in a press release.

To date, the FIU has assessed that financial sanctions totaling nearly 1.7 million euros in volume have been legally imposed. Added to this are services the monetary value of which cannot be assessed, for example, legal services or leases. The cases of application of financial sanctions in monetary currency in Estonia are usually less than 100,000 euros.

"A few years ago, credit institutions did a great job of critically reviewing their customer portfolios and canceling business relationships with high-risk non-resident customers. This means that, in the case of current restrictive measures against Russia and Belarus, the number of situations concerning the application of financial sanctions in Estonia is rather small and the amounts linked to transactions are generally low," Maeker said.

According to him, it seems that Estonia is not an attractive place where oligarchs and those currently sanctioned would keep their property, which should now be subject to financial sanctions. "Estonia's low risk position differs, for example, from Latvia, which has the highest number of beneficial owners of Russian origin in Europe besides the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom and Germany," Maeker said.

Together with the sanctions approved on March 15, the European Union has since 2014 imposed restrictive measures on 62 companies and 877 individuals, who have directly or indirectly undermined Ukraine's sovereignty or territorial integrity.

Boris Johnson said Russian president Vladimir Putin had already crossed a "red line" with his "barbarism" towards Ukraine.

Speaking to LBC radio ahead of a Nato summit in Brussels, he said: "We all want to see some solution in Ukraine. Everybody is hoping that Putin will pull back and stop this incredible barbaric slaughter that he's engaged on.

"But the only way to do that - we think there's a huge amount of unity - is to keep going with the pressure that we've applied, and to increase it.

"And the point I'm going to make today is look, you know, he's already crossed a threshold of barbarism in the way he's behaving. People talk about new red lines for chemical, biological, tactical nuclear weapons or whatever. For me, the red line already has been crossed.

"He's bombing indiscriminately civilian centres. He's causing huge numbers of casualties in wholly innocent populations."

Boris Johnson suggested the UK could target Russian president Vladimir Putin's gold reserves in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

He told LBC: "We need to do more, and so we need to do more economically. Can we do more to stop him using his gold reserves, for instance, in addition to his cash reserves?

"What can we do more to sanction Swift? And then we need to do more to give the Ukrainians military support.

"The big thing that has emerged in the last month - the huge fact that the world now knows - is that the Ukrainian people will fight for their country. They believe in their country, they love their country. They're going to defend it.

"That was something we didn't really know a month ago. It's now absolutely clear. That's changed geopolitics. It means that we have a duty to help them. We have a duty to help them protect themselves and their loved ones. And so the UK is stepping up again."

Boris Johnson compared Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to former prime minister Winston Churchill, praising him for giving the Ukrainian people their "roar".

He told LBC: "I think that President Zelensky has proved to be a quite remarkable leader of his people - he's rallied them and he's been their voice.

"He knows, as Churchill said of himself, he may not have been the lion but he's been privileged to give the roar.

"It's the Ukrainian people who have been the lion, and he's expressed their will and their sense of defiance."

Boris Johnson defended the UK's record on sanctioning Russia over the invasion of Ukraine.

He told LBC: "I think the UK - if you talk to people around Europe and the world, they fully accept that the UK was the first mover when it came to sanctioning Swift, which stops Putin getting payments for his hydrocarbons; sanctioning the Russian Central Bank, that's been absolutely crucial in paralysing the Russian economy; sanctioning Aeroflot, we were the first to do it.

"Yes, we have tough property laws in the UK, which meant that it took us a while to sanction all the oligarchs, but we've now done I think 1,000 individuals and entities, we are distraining their yachts, we're taking control of their homes.

"There is a huge economic punishment now being visited on the associates of Vladimir Putin. But... we've got to go further.

"My message today in Nato will be that there are ways in which the world can continue to intensify the pressure on Putin. And the more we do that now, the more pressure we apply now - particularly on things like gold - I believe the more we can shorten the war, shorten the slaughter in Ukraine."

Boris Johnson condemned Russia's bid to host the Euro 2028 football tournament.

The Prime Minister told LBC: "I think it's beyond satire that any football organisation no matter how bonkers and you know, driven by lucre they may be, would want to give Russia in the present circumstances the right to host a tournament."

General Sir Richard Shirreff said there is a "new cold war" and leaders at the Nato meeting in Brussels must prevent it from escalating.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the retired army officer said: "There has to be a recognition that there will be no peace in Europe while Putin is in the Kremlin.

"In Ukraine the war has gone hot.

"The task for the Nato summit today is to ensure that the necessary measures are put in place to prevent that war going hot in the rest of Europe, so we're now in a new cold war."

He called for a significant ramp-up of Nato forces on Europe's eastern flank, for more defence spending, and for western countries to continue to provide equipment to support Ukraine's fight against Russia.

Boris Johnson has said allies must "step up" support for Ukraine with sanctions and defensive military equipment as he warned Vladimir Putin is determined to "double down" on the invasion.

Speaking to broadcasters after landing in Brussels where he will attend a Nato summit, the Prime Minister said: "Vladimir Putin is plainly determined to double down on his path of violence and aggression, absolutely brutal the way he's treating the Ukrainian people.

"We've got to step up, we've got to increase our support, we've got to tighten the economic vice around Putin, sanctioning more people today as we are.

"Looking at what we can do to stop Putin using his gold reserves and also doing more to help the Ukrainians defend themselves."

Boris Johnson said the UK is sanctioning the Wagner Group, a paramilitary organisation seen as Vladimir Putin's private army.

In Brussels, the Prime Minister told broadcasters: "We've got to step up, we've got to increase our support, we've got to tighten the economic vice around Putin, sanctioning more people today as we are, sanctioning the Wagner Group."

The Government said it has sanctioned a further 59 individuals and entities in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss tweeted: "The UK has already sanctioned over 1,000 individuals and businesses since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"Today, I announce 65 more including the Wagner Group of mercenaries, Foreign Minister Lavrov's step-daughter and the CEO of Russia's largest bank."

The sanctions target key industries supporting Russia's illegal invasion, including Russian Railways and defence company Kronshtadt, the main producer of Russian drones, the Foreign Office said.

It also confirmed the paramilitary Wagner Group - seen as Vladimir Putin's private army - has been targeted.

The FCDO added that six more banks have been hit with sanctions, including Alfa Bank, along with the world's largest diamond producer, Alrosa.

Individuals sanctioned include the billionaire oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler, founder of Tinkoff bank Oleg Tinkov, Herman Gref, the CEO of Russia's largest bank Sberbank, and Polina Kovaleva, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov's step-daughter.

Meanwhile, Galina Danilchenko, who was installed by Moscow as the mayor of occupied Melitopol in south-east Ukraine, has also been targeted, it said.

Some 18,600 visas have been issued under the Ukraine family scheme as of 5pm on Wednesday, the Home Office said.

So far a total of 34,500 applications have been submitted, according to provisional data published on the department's website.

All options are on the table when it comes to seeking to prosecute Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime for war crimes in Ukraine, according to the Government's top legal adviser.

But Attorney General Suella Braverman insisted the UK's preferred approach is to hold to account those responsible through the International Criminal Court (ICC).

SNP attorney general spokeswoman Angela Crawley asked in the Commons: "Given Russia is not a member of the ICC and will almost certainly refuse to recognise its jurisdiction, what discussions has she had with her international partners on alternate forms for prosecution, and does she agree with the view of former prime ministers John Major and Gordon Brown that a court could be set up specifically for the purpose, as was the case in Nuremberg?"

Ms Braverman replied: "All options are on the table and I will always defer and support my counterpart in Ukraine, the prosecutor general, in terms of my efforts to support her in terms of her choice of route for redress.

"But whilst we welcome the focus on accountability, we do believe that the International Criminal Court is the right place for those responsible for committing these atrocious crimes in Ukraine to be held accountable for their actions.

"That's why we're focusing all of our energy, led by the Deputy Prime Minister (Dominic Raab), all of our assistance and all of our resources on the ICC prosecutor's independent investigation."

Boris Johnson has met with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen outside the Nato meeting in Brussels.

"There is one more thing I want to say to you but..." the Prime Minister said as he gestured towards the media who had been briefly let into the room.

Boris Johnson greeted Japan's prime minister, Fumio Kishida, at the Nato headquarters with a fist bump.

Mr Johnson asked himself "shirt tucked in?" as the pair entered their meeting room.

Downing Street rejected a Kremlin claim that Boris Johnson was "anti-Russian".

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said Mr Johnson was among the "most active" leaders in opposing Vladimir Putin but had no issue with the Russian people.

"The Prime Minister is among the most active anti-Putin leaders. We have no issue with the Russian people and in fact we have seen many bravely protest - not least Alexei Navalny - against Putin's regime and call on them to cease this war," the spokesman said.

"But we are among some of the world leaders that have been the most proactive when it comes to taking steps to both defend Ukraine's interests and up pressure on Putin to change course."

The spokesman said there were "very strong defences in this country" in case the UK was targeted by Russia with retaliatory measures.

Boris Johnson is understood to have asked allies at the Nato summit to question whether they have done enough to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion.

According to a UK official, the Prime Minister said: "We all want Putin to come to his senses, put his tanks into reverse.

"He's gonna grind on. Only has forward gears.

He's already crossed the red line into barbarism.

"The heroism of the Ukrainians has fundamentally changed the geopolitics of Europe...

"People will ask, did we do enough? I don't think we can deny them in their moment of agony

"We have the means and they have need."

Boris Johnson and fellow Nato leaders were addressed by Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky at their summit in Brussels.

Nato general secretary Jens Stoltenberg said: "President Zelensky addressed us with an impassioned message, thanking Nato allies for the significant support we are providing and stressing the vital importance of even more military assistance.

"Today Nato leaders agreed that we must and will provide further support to Ukraine.

"We will continue to impose unprecedented costs on Russia and will reinforce allied deterrence and defence."

The leaders formally approved the deployment of new Nato battle groups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia.

Following the Nato summit, a joint statement from the heads of state and government said: "We call on all states, including the People's Republic of China (PRC), to uphold the international order including the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, as enshrined in the UN Charter, to abstain from supporting Russia's war effort in any way, and to refrain from any action that helps Russia circumvent sanctions.

"We are concerned by recent public comments by PRC officials and call on China to cease amplifying the Kremlin's false narratives, in particular on the war and on Nato, and to promote a peaceful resolution to the conflict."

Nato is stepping up measures to protect Ukraine and members of the alliance from a Russian chemical or nuclear attack.

Secretary general Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels: "Today we agreed to do more including cyber-security assistance and equipment to help Ukraine protect against biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear threats."

This could include detection equipment, protection and medical supplies, as well as training for decontamination and "crisis management".

Mr Stoltenberg said Nato's chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence elements had been activated and "we are taking measures both to support Ukraine and to defend ourselves".

Asked whether the move was based on credible intelligence, Mr Stoltenberg said: "We are concerned, partly because we see the rhetoric and we see that Russia is trying to create some kind of pretext - accusing Ukraine, the United States, Nato allies - for preparing to use chemical and biological weapons."

Any use of chemical weapons "will totally change the nature of the conflict, it will be a blatant violation of international law and it will have widespread consequences".

He said Russia had used chemical weapons before - including in Salisbury - and had supported the Assad regime in Syria.

The Home Secretary Priti Patel has posted a photograph of herself on Twitter at a meeting with G7 interior ministers to discuss the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Alongside the photograph she tweeted: "Meeting of G7 Interior Ministers today to discuss our response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine - I set out the UK's humanitarian response and our schemes to welcome Ukrainians to the UK & the various forms of aid we are sending to Ukraine and the region.

"International allies must continue working together to denude (Vladimir) Putin of his ability to wage his barbaric war.

"There must be coordinated and robust enforcement of sanctions and firm action to protect the integrity of international law enforcement tools from Russian abuse."

Nato leaders were said to have agreed Russia using chemical weapons would mark a "fundamental change" in the Ukrainian conflict that would be met with a "very severe response".

A Western official said: "On the use of chemical weapons, we've all agreed (it) would be a fundamental change in the nature of the conflict that we would have to address."

But asked if that would include Nato troops on the ground in Ukraine, the official said: "I think it is highly unlikely that Nato would go directly into conflict with Russia because every leader agrees that we've got to stop the killing."

Most believe, the official said, that Nato entering the conflict directly would only escalate it and increase the killing and human suffering.

"I did hear leaders say that leaders say use of chemical weapons would fundamentally change the nature of the conflict and would have to have a very severe response," he said.

But he declined to outline what the response would be saying "we need to keep (Vladimir) Putin guessing".

Defence procurement minister Jeremy Quin said the UK "will always have a sufficiency of the weaponry we need to meet our needs" after a hoax video featuring Defence Secretary Ben Wallace emerged.

In one extract of a hoax call between Mr Wallace and an imposter posing as Ukrainian prime minister Denis Shmyhal, released on Tuesday, Mr Wallace seemingly suggested the UK is "running out of our own" NLAW anti-tank weapons.

Mr Quin told the PA news agency: "We will always have a sufficiency of the weaponry we need to meet our needs, whilst also supporting our friends in Ukraine, which we've done very effectively through the provision already of 4,000 anti-tank weapons."

He added: "We will do what's right. We speak regularly to the Ukrainian government and we are working very closely with them, not only in the provision of defensive equipment ourselves, but also in the convening of donor conferences for both defensive weapons and also for humanitarian support."

Boris Johnson said the UK and allies would "ramp up lethal aid to Ukraine" as its forces resist Vladimir Putin's invasion.

Speaking at a press conference in Brussels he said: "We will not stand by while Putin vents his fury on Ukraine."

The Prime Minister said kit would be provided "in the quantity and with the quality" needed by Ukraine to defend against "its bullying neighbour".

Mr Johnson has announced an extra 6,000 missiles and £25 million in unrestricted funding for Ukraine's armed forces.

He also promised a "new deployment of UK troops to Bulgaria, on top of doubling our troops both in Poland and in Estonia".

Boris Johnson said: "We must support a free and democratic Ukraine in the long term.

"This is a fellow European democracy, fighting a war of national defence.

"Nato and G7 leaders are also united today in our determination to continue turning the screws on the Kremlin's war machine, including by weaning ourselves off Russian oil and gas and reshaping global energy security."

Boris Johnson has said Western powers are looking to "steadily ratchet up" the volume of military material they are supplying to Ukraine.

Speaking following the Nato summit in Brussels the Prime Minister said no Western countries were currently looking to put "boots on the ground" or impose a no-fly zone.

"What we are doing is steadily ratcheting up the movement of lethal but defensive weaponry to Ukraine, that is growing in volume the whole time," he said.

Mr Johnson said it was proving difficult to meet a request by President Volodymyr Zelensky to supply tanks and warplanes.

"What President Zelensky want is to try to relieve Mariupol and to help the thousands of Ukrainian fighters in the city. To that end he does need armour as he sees it," he said.

"We are looking at what we can do to help. But logistically it looks very difficult both with armour and with jets."

Boris Johnson said there was not "a single person around the table" in Nato or the G7 who "is against Russia or the Russian people".

Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, the Prime Minister said: "Absolutely not, least of all me. I think I'm probably the only Prime Minister in UK history to be called Boris, I think I have that distinction, and I'm not remotely anti-Russian."

He said: "But I think what we all agree is that what Vladimir Putin is doing, the way he's leading Russia at the moment, is utterly catastrophic, that his invasion of Ukraine is inhuman and barbaric.

"And the conduct of that invasion is now moving into the type of behaviour that, as I said before, we haven't seen in the continent of Europe for 80 years, and it's horrific.

"So you can be sympathetic towards ordinary Russians, who are being so badly led, but you can be deeply hostile to the decisions of Vladimir Putin."

Any use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons by Russia would be "viewed with utter horror" by world leaders, Boris Johnson said.

The Prime Minister said: "There is a visceral horror of the use of these weapons of mass destruction.

"I think that if (Vladimir) Putin were to engage in anything like that, the consequences would be very, very severe."

He added: "I think it would be catastrophic for him if he were to do that, and I think that he understands that."

The PM said US President Joe Biden was right to warn that Russia's claims about biological laboratories in Ukraine could be a "prelude to a false flag operation and they could well do something.

"But I think it would be a profound and a disastrous mistake for Putin were he to do that," he said.

Boris Johnson backed the idea of Ukraine automatically qualifying for the World Cup later this year.

The Prime Minister was asked if he would support the idea after he earlier said Ukraine should be handed the hosting of the next Euros competition.

Speaking in Brussels, he said: "Sounds like a good idea to me but I'm out of area here, I've got to admit that's not my strong subject.

"I don't see why not, is my view."

He added: "Let me put it this way, given what Ukraine has been going through, given the privations that Ukrainian footballers have had to endure, I'm sure that every possible sympathy and allowances should be made for them."

The Prime Minister said he thought the threats over nuclear weapons were a "distraction".

He said: "It's intended to be a distraction from what is really going on and that is a savage attack with conventional means on innocent people in urban centres in Ukraine, absolutely barbaric use of artillery and mortars and rockets as I've described, thermobaric bombs included it now seems, that is what is going on.

"And what we're talking about is the right of the Ukrainian people to be equipped with the weapons to defend themselves and all discussion of nuclear weapons is intended to frame this as a confrontation between Russia as a nuclear power and other nuclear powers. That's not what's going on.

"What's going on is a confrontation between Russia and entirely innocent people in Ukraine."

Boris Johnson also suggested the Kremlin was "trying to get around the sanctions on their gold".

He said: "We're taking steps to try to make sure that there's no leakage or no sale of bullion into markets around the world."

President Joe Biden has said Nato had never been more united than it is now in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Following an emergency summit of alliance leaders in Brussels, Mr Biden said Vladimir Putin had miscalculated on its response.

"Putin was banking on Nato being split. It was clear to me that he didn't think we could sustain this cohesion," he said.

"Nato has never, never been more united. Putin is getting exactly the opposite of (what) he intended to have as a consequence of going into Ukraine."

Mr Biden, who has previously warned that Russia could use chemical weapons, said there would be a response if that happened.

"We would respond. We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use," he said.

Boris Johnson has said he is "not optimistic that Vladimir Putin really wants" peace.

In a clip of an interview with the BBC's Newsnight programme, posted on social media, the Prime Minister was asked how seriously he was taking the peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.

He said while it was "entirely the sensible thing to do" he added: "If this thing could be solved, it would be fantastic. I've got to tell you I'm not optimistic Vladimir Putin really wants that.

"I think he's decided to double down and to try to Groznyfy the great cities of Ukraine in the way that he has always tried to do and I think that's a tragic mistake. But that's what he seems to be doing at the moment.

"Therefore, we need to do more as the West, intensifying the sanctions, sending more missiles as we announced today, 6,000 more missiles, toughening up our sanctions, doing more to stop leakage of Russian gold. All the ways in which we can tighten the screw on him."

The full interview is due to be aired later on Thursday.

Boris Johnson said Ukraine could win the war with Russia.

In an interview with BBC's Newsnight programme to be aired on Thursday night, he said: "I think Ukraine can certainly win. I don't think it's going to be easy, I think that the situation for the Ukrainians is grim, miserable.

"I don't think that we've seen anything like it for 80 years in Europe and what (Vladimir) Putin is doing is unconscionable.

"But there's a sense in which Putin has already failed or lost because I think that he had literally no idea that the Ukrainians were going to mount the resistance that they are and he totally misunderstood what Ukraine is.

"And far from extinguishing Ukraine as a nation he is solidifying it."

Boris Johnson has said that, even if Nato does not grant Ukraine full membership, allies would provide the country with so much support that Russia would not consider invading again.

In an interview with the BBC's Newsnight programme, to be aired on Thursday night, the Prime Minister said: "Over time, you can imagine that even if you can't have an Article 5 guarantee for Ukraine - I mean, full membership of Nato, inside the thermonuclear umbrella as it were - you can imagine that Western sympathisers of Ukraine will provide so much by way of equipment, training, intelligence as to create a kind of deterrence for Ukraine by denial - deterrence by denial of Russian possibility to invade again.

"What I'm talking about is so fortifying, so strengthening, the quills of the Ukrainian porcupine as to make it in future indigestible to the Russian invaders."

The UK and western allies have linked Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) - the successor agency to the KGB - to "a historic global campaign targeting critical national infrastructure", the Foreign Office has said.

The department said the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) was "almost certain" that the FSB's Centre 16 - which it said was also known by its hacker group pseudonyms of Energetic Bear, Berserk Bear and Crouching Yeti - had targeted critical IT systems and national infrastructure in Europe, the Americas and Asia.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: "Russia's targeting of critical national infrastructure is calculated and dangerous. It shows Putin is prepared to risk lives to sow division and confusion among allies.

"We are sending a clear message to the Kremlin by sanctioning those who target people, businesses and infrastructure. We will not tolerate it.

"We will continue to work together with our allies to turn the ratchet and starve Putin's war machine of its funding and resources."

The Foreign Office added Liz Truss had sanctioned a Russian defence ministry subsidiary, the Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics, for an incident where malware was used to target safety override controls in a Saudi petro-chemicals plant in 2017.

The malware used against the petro-chemical plant caused two emergency shutdowns.

The Foreign Office said the FSB had also previously targeted UK energy companies and the American aviation sector, and it accused the FSB of trying to "spear-phish" the press secretary of Mikhail Khodorkovskiy, a UK-based critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Spear-phishing involves sending targeted electronic communications to a specific individual, group or company for purposes of stealing data, espionage or fraud.

Boris Johnson has said he "totally agrees" that Brexit and the Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion are not the same.

The Prime Minister has come under criticism for comments where he appeared to compare the UK voting to leave the EU, and the Ukrainian fight against Russia.

Speaking at the Conservative Party spring forum at the weekend, he said it was the "instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom", with the Brexit vote a "famous recent example".

But speaking to BBC's Newsnight programme on Thursday, he said: "That was not an analogy that I was making. I'm afraid that was wildly misconstrued.

"I said, I think in the same passage, that there's been nothing like what we're seeing in Ukraine since 1945 and it is a horror, and it can't be compared to anything since 1945."

The Prime Minister said he "of course" welcomes tough questions over his involvement in the partygate saga as he said such probing would not be allowed in Vladimir Putin's Russia.

In an interview on the BBC's Newsnight programme, Boris Johnson was asked what it meant that his position had been saved by the invasion.

He said: "I think what it says is that we're very lucky to live in a country where journalists can quite properly go hard on this sort of question, this sort of issue, because I can tell you, Nick, that is not what happens in Vladimir Putin's Russia, and it's certainly something that we want to make sure continues to happen in Ukraine."

Asked if he would therefore welcome tough questions about partygate, where numerous parties were allegedly held across Whitehall during Covid restrictions, the PM laughed and then said: "Yes, of course. That is what it's all about. And it's about...and I mean it quite seriously."

He added: "I think what people understand is that if Vladimir Putin lived in a democracy, and if Vladimir Putin had Newsnight on his case, and people asking him really penetrating questions about what he really thought he was doing in in Ukraine and whether he really understood what kind of people the Ukrainians were, and if he'd really thought it through, I don't think he would have made the catastrophic mistake that he's made.

"And in a way, what he has done - this appalling invasion - is paradoxically an advertisement for the importance of the very system that he's trying to destroy in Ukraine. That's what we're trying to protect."

ESTONIA: NO EU SANCTIONS ON RUSSIAN OIL AND GAS ON TABLE RIGHT NOW

No plans are currently in place to impose European Union-level sanctions on Russia, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas (Reform) said. Kallas had been attending a European Council meeting, which had also focused on natural gas and electricity prices as a whole.

Speaking to ERR's Brussels correspondent Joosep Vark, Kallas said while "We have made four packages of very harsh sanctions, and they have been enforced quickly", no further sanctions were on the table, at a time when Russia's invasion of Ukraine entered its fifth week.

"There is no feeling that new sanctions should be imposed immediately. The assumption was that we should start looking at how the current sanctions will pan out," she added.

The European Council meeting in Brussels discussed the joint purchase of gas and bringing the price of electricity under control.

Kallas, who as a former MEP is relatively well-versed in the EU corridors of power, said that the major question, for her, remained whether, when and how to sanction Russian oil and gas exports.

The EU has not as yet halted the in-flow of either, though the NordStream 2 pipeline work has been halted.

One method Kallas suggested, one which she made on March 24 also, was setting up an escrow account for Russian gas supply payments, the funds of which could be diverted away from Russia where needed.

Kallas said: "My suggestion is that this can be done so one part of the gas revenue, which should be paid to Russia is paid into a separate fund, aimed at rebuilding Ukraine. The message would then be clear to Russia: for every building you bomb, you have to pay for it and we will take that money; we will pay you less for gas."

As to the likelihood of the plan being adopted by the EU, Kallas said: "Colleagues need a little more time to get used to the idea, but there are more and more arguments coming in its favor. It seemed that many people liked this proposal, which would kill two birds with one stone."

The meeting mainly focused on preparations for next winter, following the preceding winter's soaring energy costs. Fear of fluctuations and another winter like the last one in terms of energy prices has made many EU member states' leaders leery of sanctioning Russian fossil fuels - i.e. oil and gas, too quickly.

Spain has in the recent past called for a cap on natural gas prices, while Germany and the Netherlands oppose such a move, arguing that gas-dependent companies should be listened to. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

Minister to propose banning Yandex from taxi service in Estonia

TALLINN, Mar 29, BNS – Minister of Entrepreneurship and Information Technology Andres Sutt is set to submit a proposal to the government on the basis of the International Sanctions Act to prohibit Yandex NV from organizing and brokering taxi services and providing other services associated with aforementioned services in Estonia.

The aim of the measure is to prevent the collection and exploitation of data on Estonian users by Russian intelligence services, spokespeople for the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications said on Tuesday.

According to the minister, an important motivation for the imposition of the domestic sanction is the recent decision by Russia that Yandex must share personal data collected by it with that country's national security service.

"In order to use Yandex NV's services, one needs to provide access to a large amount of personal data, which will be processed on the company's servers in Russia. In essence, the Russian special services and political leadership can exploit the data and access possibilities available to Yandex, and this is a significant threat to Estonia's security, especially in the current political situation," said Sutt.

Warnings to the same effect have been issued in Estonia by both the Internal Security Service and the Data Protection Inspectorate.

According to Russian media, a new draft legislation is being prepared in Russia that obliges taxi-hailing services to share data on their orders, including data on the location of the vehicle and the driver, with the national security service FSB.

The proposal by the minister calls for Yandex NV to be prohibited from providing the service of organizing and brokering taxi service in Estonia, and it would also be prohibited for any other party to enable Yandex to make these services available directly or indirectly.

A solution is being developed in cooperation with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications and other state agencies of Estonia that would allow the sanction to be enforced nationally in the most effective way and to limit both the availability of the Yandex.Go driving app and the provision of services through it.

Yandex is one of the leading companies in Russia, which plays a major role in both the Russian economy and the IT sector.

"As the company is closely connected with the Russian authorities, today we have a situation where persons under European Union sanctions may benefit from the economic activities of Yandex NV. Prohibiting the activities of a company that supports the Russian special services in Estonia would be an additional measure to put pressure on the Putin regime and would also send a clear signal that companies linked to the Russian ruling elite have no place in the Estonian market," Sutt emphasized.

The minister added that although sanctions would be most effective if they were imposed jointly in Europe, today's proposal also would impose a national ban on Yandex.

"Estonia has made its proposals for the discussion of new EU sanctions and we are waiting for an EU-wide solution, but in order to achieve a quick impact, we must restrict the use of this service at the earliest opportunity," Sutt added.

ESTONIA: IT MINISTER CALLS FOR BAN ON YANDEX RIDE-HAILING APP

Enterprise and IT minister Andres Sutt (Reform) has proposed banning Russian taxi ride-hailing firm Yandex, on the grounds its data are likely to be exploited by Russian intelligence services.

Sutt said: "Companies related to the Russian regime do not have a place in the Estonian marketplace."

A key factor in the sanction decision is that Yandex is required to share personal data with Russian data authorities, at the latter's behest, Sutt added.

He said: "In order to use Yandex NV's services, it is a requirement access to a large amount of personal data processed on the company's servers in Russia is granted. In essence, Russia's special services and political leadership may take advantage of Yandex data and access to the data."

The Internal Security Service (ISS) and the Data Protection Inspectorate (AKI) have both also issued warnings on the use of Yandex in Estonia, for the same reasons.

Russia's own media have reported legislation, which obliges taxi hailing services to share order data with the Federal Security Service (FSB) Federal Security Service (FSB), is being prepared.

The data demanded include a taxi's location and data about its driver.

Leaving Yandex un-sanctioned might also leave a workaround for individuals or companies already hit in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Sutt added.

"Since the company is closely linked with the Russian authorities, we have a situation today where Yandex NV's economic activities could benefit those subject to EU sanctions," Sutt said.

The ruling would prohibit Yandex NV from organizing, brokering and providing taxi and other related services in Estonia, on the basis of the International Sanctions Act.

Yandex is one of Russia's leading companies, playing a major role in both the Russian economy and its IT sector.

While the EU may also sanction Yandex, it so far has not done so and so Estonia is to impose its own censures, the minister has added.

He said: "Estonia has made its proposals for the discussion of new EU sanctions and we are waiting for a solution across the EU, but in order to achieve a rapid impact, we must restrict the use of this service as soon as possible," adding that an EU-wide ban would be most effective.

The sanctions will likely be developed in cooperation with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, as well as relevant state agencies, and would restrict effectively both the availability of the Yandex.Go driving application and the services it offers, the ministry said.

The ministry had been considering Yandex's future in Russia for several weeks and in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24.

Sutt's proposal will be put to the cabinet for consideration.

Yandex expanded into the Estonian market in 2018, in direct competition with other ride-hailing apps such as the Estonian-founded Bolt (then known as Taxify). In conjunction with Uber, Yandex set up a joint venture in both Russia and neighboring countries in the following year, with Uber investing a reported EUR 225 million and Yandex EUR 100 million.

TALLINN, Apr 01, BNS – Taxi drivers staged a protest outside the building of government ministries in downtown Tallinn on Friday afternoon to protest against the ban imposed by the government on the Yandex Go taxi service, Postimees reported.

"This decision will make many people unemployed, depriving drivers of the opportunity to earn a living for themselves and their families," said Martin Mets, one of the leaders of the protest. 

The Estonian government on Thursday approved a domestic sanction against Yandex NV, banning the company from operating in Estonia.

An important reason for imposing the sanction is Russia's recent decision that Yandex must share the personal data it collects with the Russian special service.

Government signs off on Yandex ban in Estonia

(c) 2022 Prime News Agency All Rights Reserved.
Tbilisi. April 01 (Prime-News)- The government approved on Thursday a national sanction on Russian ride-hailing firm Yandex, banning the company from operating in Estonia.

The ban will take effect on Monday, April 11 and means that Yandex NV is prohibited from providing taxi organization and brokerage services in Estonia.

Yandex is barred from making these services available indirectly, as well as directly, in Estonia.

Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said the measure related to security, in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

She said: "The ban on Yandex's activities gives a clear signal that companies cooperating with Russian secret services have no place in Estonia. We have also proposed to the European Union that it impose a sanction on Yandex."

A key concern is that Yandex is required to share personal data it collects, data which in turn is likely to be accessible to the FSB and other Russian security organs.

IT and foreign trade minister Andres Sutt (Reform), who first proposed banning Yandes earlier this month, said: "The purpose of the sanction is to prevent the collection and exploitation of Estonian users' data by Russian intelligence services."

"In order to use the Yandex app, users need to grant access to a large amount of personal data processed on the company's servers in Russia," Sutt added, calling this a security risk to Estonia.

The sanction means that individual taxi drivers and taxi firms will not be able to use the Yandex Pro app to gain and fulfill orders, while Internet Service Providers in Estonia must restrict access to Yandex NV's taxi-related apps and sites (Yandex Go and Yandex Pro).

App stores operating in Estonia, including Google Play and Apple's App Store must bar the downloading of Yandex apps and must stop providing updates to those devices in Estonia which have already downloaded the app, since it entered the Estonian market in 2018.

The task of informing taxi license holders of the sanction falls to the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority (TTJA).

Yandex provides one of the largest internet search engines used in Russia, and is the largest tech company in that country, ERR reports.

BUCHAREST, April 4 (Reuters) - The European Union should speed up new sanctions against Russia and include the energy sector, Estonia's Foreign Minister Eva-Maria Liimets said on Monday.

"Also we should sanction the energy sector, we should not have any limits to sanctions because this unjustified, brutal war must end." (Reporting by Luiza Ilie; Writing by Jason Hovet; Editing by Alison Williams)

Bucharest, April 4 /Agerpres/ - Estonian Foreign Minister Eva-Maria Liimets said on Monday that at EU level, but also at the international community's one, more pressure should be put on Russia to stop the war in Ukraine.

She emphasized, in a joint statement at the end of consultations with Romanian counterpart Bogdan Aurescu , that Estonia and Romania must continue to coordinate their positions as NATO 's Eastern Flank states.

Romania and Estonia have a lot in common, including a common European identity. We have similar views when it comes to neighborhood policy and transatlantic ties, but I think we can create an even closer connection between our two countries. After 100 years of diplomatic relations and 30 years since the restoration of diplomatic relations, we should find new ideas, refresh bilateral relations. I believe that tomorrow's business conference will give us new ideas. We have the same geographical position and the same approach when it comes to security issues. It is important that NATO takes a step forward and establishes a bolder defense policy. (...) Being on the Eastern Flank, it is important to coordinate our positions, as we do today, and to coordinate them in the B9 format, as happened last week, Eva-Maria Liimets said in a joint statement with Bogdan Aurescu .

The head of Estonian diplomacy stressed the need to adjust the position of deterrence and defence in the context of concerns over the situation in Ukraine.

We are in a very difficult time and that is why we must continue to adjust our position of deterrence and defence, and we must continue to see how we can best help Ukraine and put pressure on Russia to stop this unfortunate war because we see innocent people dying in an unjust war that has been started by Russia and that has been going on for over a month. Thousands of civilians have died and we have had the crimes in Bucha (...) and, of course, Russia must to be held accountable for these actions and, most importantly, for the international community to take a stand and call on the International Criminal Court to launch an investigation without delay, because the Russian forces must be held accountable for these actions and, of course, the was criminals must be brought to court, said Eva-Maria Liimets.

According to her, the talks also included the topic of what the international community should do in addition to putting pressure on Russia to stop this war and help Ukraine restore its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

We must continue to put even more pressure on Russia to stop this war. And from our point of view, we must accelerate the next package of sanctions at EU level and implement sanctions as strong as possible to stop the cashflow from Russia to no longer be able to fuel the war machine. We should also sanction the energy sector, there should be no limits to sanctions, because this brutal and unjustified war must end. We also proposed that Russia be held accountable for the destruction of Ukraine's civilian infrastructure. This means that Russia must take part in rebuilding Ukraine, and we must start immediately. We should use Russia's frozen assets for this reconstruction, and we should use part of the payments for Russia, for gas, to rebuild Ukraine. We suggested opening a separate account that would act as a fund and collect money for gas and thus recover the costs of rebuilding Ukraine. From our point of view, it is very important to use every legal opportunity to put pressure on Russia to stop the war and then to hold them accountable for this war, Liimets said.

She recalled that Estonia and Romania were at the forefront of supporting Ukraine, noting that the Estonian side had provided 230 million euros in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

Of course we continue to see what we can do more together and I would like to congratulate Romania for receiving so many refugees and for taking the initiative to support Moldova in accepting refugees, Eva Maria Liimets said.

ESTONIA: RUSSIAN OLIGARCH-OWNED BUSINESS CONTINUES TO EARN MILLIONS

Logistics company DBT, which is owned by Viatcheslav Kantor, a businessman in Russian presidentling Pootin's favor and Russia's 16th richest person, continues to operate unimpeded at the Port of Tallinn-owned Muuga Harbor, as the West has yet to impose any sanctions on him. European dependence on Russian fertilizer may continue to keep Kantor safe from being sanctioned as well.

According to Port of Tallinn Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) Margus Vihman, business at Muuga Harbor, located 11 kilometers northeast of Tallinn, is currently running smoothly for DBT - named Estonia's most successful company in 2020 by business daily Aripaev.

"DBT's volumes are currently more or less ordinary," Vihman said. "Maybe slightly smaller than last year, but relatively ordinary."

Its fertilizer terminal, which processes several million tons of fertilizer a year, is an important partner for the Port of Tallinn, the CCO said, noting that the DBT terminal was one of the five biggest terminals at Muuga Harbor.

According to its annual report, DBT, which operates at the ports in Muuga and Sillamae, earned a net profit of EUR 5.5 million on EUR 39 million in revenue in 2020. A year earlier, the company's net profits were four times higher than that at approximately EUR 23 million. Revenue in 2019, meanwhile, totaled some EUR 65 million.

DBT public relations manager Ago Tiiman said that while he understood the interest in their company, he did not want to offer further details regarding how the company was doing.

DBT is a subsidiary of global mineral fertilizer producer Acron. Dmitry Khabrat, a member of the board at DBT, likewise serves on the board of Acron. Acron in turn, however, belongs to Viatcheslav Kantor, the 16th richest person in Russia, valued by Bloomberg at the beginning of Russia's war in Ukraine to be worth approximately EUR 8.4 billion.

In 2017, Pootin bestowed Kantor with the Order of Honor, "in recognition of his professional achievements and long-standing fair work." Half a year earlier, Pootin and Kantor were among those to ceremoniously launch production of rare earth metals together at Russia's biggest ammonia unit in Veliky Novgorod. Acron's press release at the time noted that the launch of the unit was "strategically important to ensuring national security" and gradually ending the importing of rare earth metals into Russia.

Kantor's name was included on the U.S. Treasury Department's 2018 "Putin list" of more than 200 prominent officials and oligarchs that had seen success during the Pootin regime specifically.

Thus far, however, 68-year-old Kantor has not been included on sanction lists in the EU, the U.S. or the U.K. He is not the exception either - according to Bloomberg, the EU has sanctioned just nine of Russia's top 20 richest people.

Prime Minister Kaja Kallas (Reform) said that she had not read the sanctions list in sufficient detail to comment on why Kantor or several other major Russian oligarchs weren't included. She did, however, note that the point of the sanctions was to punish first and foremost those who supported the Pootin regime or either justified or directly financially benefited from it.

Kallas nonetheless also said that the EU must introduce tougher sanctions on Russia.

"We have always been of the opinion that sanctions should be strong and tough," she said. "Because if they are imposed quickly, then they have an impact as well."

Rena Tasuja, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Bureau of Sanctions and Strategic Goods, likewise declined to comment regarding possible sanctions against Kantor.

"It wouldn't be reasonable to speculate publicly about potential subjects of sanctions," Tasuja said. "First and foremost in order to avoid potential outflows of sanctioned individuals' assets and providing them with signals in that regard."

According to Tasuja, the EU's sanctions list currently includes those who have most endangered Ukraine and who have been closest to the Kremlin's decision-making. Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, she noted, EU sanctions had been imposed on nearly 600 people, including Russian oligarchs, members of the State Duma and the Security Council of Russia, and high-ranking military officials.

"Russian oligarchs' wealth does draw a lot of attention, but it needs to be understood that wealth may not inherently constitute grounds for being added to the sanctions list," the ministry official explained. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

ESTONIA: NOT CLEAR HOW TO PAY FOR RUSSIAN GAS IN RUBLES

Exactly how Estonia will have to pay for imports of Russian natural gas in rubles, following an announcement from Russian presidentling Pootin that European customers would have to do just that, is not yet clear, Estonia's largest gas supplier, Eesti Gaas says.

The next payment, to the Russian state energy monopoly Gazprom, is due this month, while an explanation of how this will be transacted in rubles is still wanting.

Raul Kotov, Eesti Gaas board member, said: "Nothing like this has happened before and, as we have understood, this could take another week or more. The processes are still being clarified and the rules are being discussed, so we look forward to seeing it," adding that as far as he understood it the policy applied to the whole of Europe so far as gas purchases go.

Marko Allikson, board member of independent energy traders Baltic Energy Partners, said that the reasons why Moscow had taken such a step was also not entirely clear.

He said: "The first thought was definitely one of PR, as if to announce that if you don't pay in rubles, you won't get any gas, and that's a threat. What Russia is essentially doing is probably trying to cement major commercial bank Gazprombank's position. This bank is currently not under sanctions, and this would mean that the EU in future should not sanction the payments or the bank."

The move might also prop up the ruble, which has rallied somewhat in recent days after hitting rock bottom a month ago, though at the same time the price in contracts is generally in US dollars or in euros, he said,

The effect of longer term will be for customers to look for alternatives to Russian natural gas, Allikson added, including inside the EU, which to date still purchases Russian oil and gas.

The other two Baltic States, Latvia and Lithuania, have announced that they are no longer importing Russian natural gas, with the head of Latvia's natural gas storage operator making an announcement to that effect on April 2.

Lithuania's President, Gitanas Nauseda, made a similar announcement on his social media account and called on the rest of the EU to follow suit.

Lithuania has a Liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal vessel at the port of Klaipeda, while calls to put in place a similar floating terminal at Paldiski, Estonia, to serve Finland and Latvia as well as Estonia, are under discussion.

Late last week, Pootin announced that European customers should either pay for their gas in Rubles or be cut off, a development which major customer Germany referred to as "blackmail". (ERR/Business World Magazine)

The European Commission is working on ending the purchase of Russian oil and gas even though new sanctions announced April 6 did not touch on it, head of the European Commission Representation in Estonia Vivian Loonela has said.

"You are, of course, asking where the end of the oil and gas purchases is - work is underway, not all member states agree yet. Estonia's proposal is helpful here, where European countries would not directly pay Russia, but into a special account set aside for this, from which part of the money is already set aside for the reconstruction of Ukraine," she said.

She said sanctions proposed by the Commission would be discussed between the member states and would then hopefully take effect.

"At the same time, the Commission will continue to work on the next steps, as 62% of Russia's exports to the EU before the war were fossil fuels - so it is clear what needs to be done next," Loonela added.

The Commission put forward proposals on April 6 that ban imports of coal; deny Russian ships access to EU ports; block access to Russian and Belarusian haulage companies transiting the EU; ban more Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system; and sanction additional officials.

Estonian Internal Security Service suspecting 2 people of violating intl sanctions

TALLINN, Apr 07, BNS - The Estonian Internal Security Service is suspecting two people of violating international sanctions and apprehended said people on Wednesday.

The Internal Security Service has apprehended Elena Cherysheva, 43, and Mati-Dmitri Terestal, 50, who are being suspected of a crime against peace, namely of violating international sanctions.

Based on evidence collected in a criminal case launched last year, there is reason to suspect that Cherysheva and Terestal have made over 350,000 euros' worth economic resources available to a sanctioned person through the Russian propaganda portal Sputnik. According to the suspicion, the funds originated in the Russian Federation. Cherysheva and Terestal kept the portal active also after the EU's sanction of March 1, 2022. The suspicion has been lodged based on section 931 of the Estonian Penal Code.

Chief State Prosecutor Taavi Pern said that the criminal case was launched over suspected economic relations that have been banned with international sanctions.

"The European Union has established international sanctions due to the international crimes committed against the Ukrainian state and people. Violating these sanctions is a crime against peace," he said.

"The content published on the portal will not be assessed in these criminal proceedings," Pern said.

"International sanctions are an important instrument for restoring peace in Ukraine, which Russia has been violating since 2014," Harrys Puusepp, bureau head at the ISS, said. "Sadly, for more than a month already, Russia and its army have gone even further, committing war crimes and crimes against humanity on top of crimes against peace."

Investigating crimes against peace, including violations of sanctions, and collecting evidence regarding such crimes is a priority for the Estonian state.

"We take the investigation of crimes against peace with the full severity of the law and do our best to conclude the preliminary investigation as thoroughly and efficiently as possible," Puusepp said.

The criminal proceedings are being carried out by the Internal Security Service and led by the Office of the Prosecutor General.

TALLINN, Apr 07, BNS – The Estonian government approved a sanction on Thursday that restricts the opportunities of Russian and Belarusian citizens to work or do business in Estonia and suspends the issuance of visas and residence permits for employment and business to citizens of these two countries.

Minister of the Interior Kristian Jaani described the sanction as an additional step to avoid a contradiction where international and national sanctions are in place to block the economy and investments of Russia and Belarus, but at the same time residence permits remain available for citizens of these countries to do business and work in Estonia.

"We must resolutely limit the opportunities for citizens of these two countries to come and take up residence in Estonia," Jaani said according spokespeople for the government.

Estonia is not revoking the existing residence permits and the valid bases for stay and employment in Estonia and, if they exist, a person can also apply for their extension or changing the basis for stay in Estonia in accordance with the law.

For example, on the basis of a residence permit already issued for employment, a Russian or Belarusian citizen can apply for a new residence permit in order to work for another employer. If the conditions provided by law are not met or the person has violated Estonian law, he or she loses the right to stay in Estonia.

For example, a residence permit will be revoked if a person has incited ethnic, racial, religious or political hatred or violence, or has committed a crime.

It will continue to be possible to travel to Estonia as part of family migration or for humanitarian reasons.

TALLINN, Apr 08, BNS – Yandex Go said on Friday it has still not received official information about why the government decided to ban Yandex from offering taxi services in Estonia, and plans to challenge the decision.

"We do not agree with the blocking and the government's reasoning in the press is confusing," Yandex Go spokesman Erez Vega-Kadoch said in a press release, adding that there had been no complaints about the service in the past. 

The spokesman for Yandex emphasized that the Yandex Go service in Estonia and many other countries is provided by the Dutch company Yandex.Taxi B.V., which works in compliance with the laws of the European Union and the Estonian state.

"The Russian draft legislation, which the government refers to in the media, has been under discussion for several years and Estonia and other countries have nothing to do with it. Even if it is adopted in its current form in Russia, the law would only apply to Russian services and rides  within Russia," Vega-Kadoch said, adding that the Dutch company Yandex.Taxi B.V. does not operate the service in Russia.

The Estonian government on March 31 approved a domestic sanction against Yandex NV, banning the company from operating in Estonia. The sanction is effective April 11.

As a result of the sanction, taxi companies and drivers working through Yandex are prohibited from working through the Yandex taxi application Yandex Pro and fulfilling orders. In order to implement the restriction and raise awareness, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority will notify the holders of taxi transport permits of the state sanction through the register of economic activities.

Internet service providers must also restrict access to the websites and applications -- Yandex Go and Yandex Pro -- related to Yandex NV's taxi services. App stores, such as Google Play, App Store, and others must also restrict the download of Yandex taxi applications from their app store and stop offering updates to said apps.

Vilnius, April 8 (ELTA) – On 8 April, in Tallinn, Estonia, Minister of the Interior of Lithuania Agnė Bilotaitė met with Estonian and Latvian counterparts to discuss the regional security situation, threats at the EU's external border and the flow of Ukrainian refugees after Russia invaded Ukraine.

Bilotaitė says the ministers have agreed to share information between the Baltic States before the joint EU registration system of Ukrainian refugees is launched.

Lithuania has already registered 41,400 refugees from Ukraine, Latvia – 19,000 and Estonia 39,500.

The minister called to immediately and substantially increase the security of the Baltic Sea region. At a recent emergency council of the EU's interior ministers, Bilotaitė raised the issue of transit via Lithuania to Russia's Kaliningrad Region and asked the European Commission to provide additional funding to ensure Lithuania's and the EU's security.

Bilotaitė, Latvia's Interior Minister Marija Golubeva and Estonia's Interior Minister Kristian Jaani also discussed the situation at the EU's external border with Belarus. Lithuania recently witnessed a spike in illegal border crossing attempts from Belarus. This year, Lithuanian border guards prevented 1,300 migrants from entering the country illegally from Belarus.

Construction of border barriers was also addressed. Lithuania has already laid more than 310 km of concertina wire and installed 210 km stretches of border fence at its 679 km long border with Belarus. Latvia has already installed the fence on 48 km of its 173 km long border with Belarus. Meanwhile, Estonia has installed 23 km stretch of a fence at its 136 km long border with Russia.

The ministers also discussed the implementation of the 5th EU sanction package against Russia.

Yandex prohibited from offering taxi services in Estonia from Monday

TALLINN, Apr 11, BNS – The Estonian government's domestic sanction against Yandex NV, banning the company from operating in Estonia, entered into force on Monday, April 11.

An important reason for imposing the sanction is Russia's recent decision that Yandex must share the personal data it collects with the local special service.

 "The purpose of the sanction is to prevent the collection and exploitation of the data of Estonian users by the Russian intelligence services. In order to use the Yandex application, it is necessary to provide access to a large amount of personal data that is processed on the company's servers in Russia and that may be used in intelligence activities against Estonia and Europe. In the current political situation, this is a significant threat to Estonia's security," Minister of Entrepreneurship and Information Technology Andres Sutt said in late March.

According to Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, the imposition of an additional sanction is necessary to protect Estonia's security. "The ban on Yandex's activities gives a clear signal that companies cooperating with Russian special services have no place in Estonia. We have also proposed that the European Union impose a sanction against Yandex," she said.

As a sanction, a restriction will be imposed on Yandex NV to provide services and enable the provision of services in Estonia. This means that Yandex NV is prohibited from providing taxi service organization and mediation services in Estonia, and it would also be prohibited to directly or indirectly allow Yandex to make the services mentioned available.

As a result of the sanction, taxi companies and drivers working through Yandex are prohibited from working through the Yandex taxi application (Yandex Pro) and fulfilling orders. In order to implement the restriction and raise awareness, the Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority shall notify the holders of taxi transport permits of the state sanction through the register of economic activities.

Internet service providers must also restrict access to websites and applications (Yandex Go and Yandex Pro) related to Yandex NV's taxi services. App stores (Google Play, App Store, and others) must also restrict the download of Yandex taxi applications from their app store and stop offering updates to apps.

TALLINN, Apr 11, BNS - The Estonian government's domestic sanction against Yandex NV, banning the company from operating in Estonia, entered into force on Monday, April 11, whereas the company deems the restriction unreasonable and intends to challenge it. 

With the operating ban stepping into effect on April 11, Yandex has announced it ceased its activities before the deadline to protect its drivers and cooperation partners from possible difficulties, such as fines. 

"We want to underline that we deem the Estonian authorities restricting our activities unreasonable and intend to challenge it. There have previously been no complaints about our service. The service by Yandex Go is represented in Estonia and in many other states by Dutch company Yandex.Taxi B.V., which strictly follows EU and GDPR rules and the Estonian law," the company said in a press release. 

A significant part of Estonia's sanction stems from Russia's decision imposing an obligation on Yandex to share the data it collects with the local special service.

According to Yandex, the Russian draft legislation to which the Estonian government refers has been in handling for several years and has nothing to do with either Estonia or any other state.

Estonian president in Kyiv: Only Russia's defeat will bring back peace in Europe

TALLINN, Apr 13, BNS - At a meeting in Kyiv on Wednesday, Estonian President Alar Karis and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed the provision of aid to defenders of Ukraine and the civilian population.

"Only Russia losing this war will bring back peace in Europe because Europe's security is inextricably linked to Ukraine. The West has to do more to help Ukraine which has fallen victim of Russia's aggression. It has to do it fast. Russian forces must be fought off everywhere like they have already been fought off near Kyiv. Ukraine needs heavy weaponry on land, in the air and at sea to increase its combat capability," Karis said.

The Estonian head of state was in Ukraine together with Polish President Andrzej Duda, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda and Latvian President Egils Levits. The presidents of the Baltic states and Poland jointly met with Zelensky and, with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, visited the settlement of Borodyanka destroyed by the Russian army.

Karis underscored that Ukraine currently needs everyone's help more than ever, with the need for rapid military aid being particularly urgent.

"Ukraine and the West did everything in their power to prevent this terrible war through diplomacy and dialogue. President Putin, however, decided to start a war and now guns are doing the talking. Now, the only way to peace is through success in the battlefield," the Estonian head of state said.

"Estonia has provided military assistance to Ukraine in the volume equal to one-third of our yearly defense spending," Karis said. "In addition, we have also been vocal supporters of the West's clear, precise and efficient economic sanctions. Russia is the sole culprit in this war and the sanctions established so far and those to be established in the future must help stop the aggressor."

The need to sanction Russian energy carriers, particularly oil, was also highlighted at the meeting.

The five presidents also discussed at their meeting how to enable the export of Ukrainian cereal and other goods through Poland and the Baltic states due to access to trade routes being blocked from the sea.

Karis affirmed that Estonia is ready to send experts to assist the Ukrainian prosecutor's office and the International Criminal Court in the investigation of Russia's war crimes.

"Killing, torture and the use of illegal weapons will not go unpunished. The war crimes committed by the Russian forces in Ukraine must be investigated in depth and thoroughly. The people who planned and committed these atrocities must be brought to justice," Karis underlined.

"The Ukrainian people have shown extraordinary courage in the face of the Russian army's cruelty. Ukraine is a state that wants to be free, has the right to be free and belongs in the European family," the president said.

"I speak on behalf of the Estonian people when I say that we are horrified by the atrocities the aggressor has committed and is committing against the Ukrainian people. We share the pain of the Ukrainian people, and it is breaking souls and hearts," he said.

"We're witnessing 21st century Russia's goal to destroy the Ukrainian state and people. We mourn every life lost and every home destroyed in this war and we support every war refugee who has fled the violence and destruction in Ukraine," the president added.

With regard to international support, Karis said that Ukraine, which is fighting for the preservation of its state and nation, has many friends.

"We're seeing Russia's war against Ukraine making states reassess their views and democratic countries come together to form a strong united front supporting Ukraine. This friendship is valuable and needs to be preserved," the head of state said.

President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for almost an hour Wednesday, a day after Zelenskyy praised Biden for accusing Russia's Vladimir Putin of genocide.

Biden said in a statement that he has authorized an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, including weapons and ammunition.

"The Ukrainian military has used the weapons we are providing to devastating effect," Biden said. "As Russia prepares to intensify its attack in the Donbas region, the United States will continue to provide Ukraine with the capabilities to defend itself."

Zelenskyy tweeted about their discussion, saying: "Continued constant dialogue with @POTUS. Assessed Russian war crimes. Discussed additional package of defensive and possible macro-financial aid. Agreed to enhance sanctions."

Also Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that China and other nations declining to sanction Russia could face future economic fallout for failing to help end Russia's "heinous war" in Ukraine.

Ukrainians willing to help Russia retrieve bodies

Authorities in the east-central Ukraine city of Dnipro say they are willing to help return to Russia the bodies of more than 1,500 Russian soldiers now in city morgues.

"We already have four refrigerators full of bodies of Russian soldiers," Deputy Mayor Mykhailo Lysenko said. "No matter what, these are someone's children."

The city's airport and some infrastructure were destroyed by rocket attacks just days ago. Military analysts say Russia's new focus on eastern Ukraine could include Dnipro, a city of 1 million people in the Donbas region, where Russian separatists have battled Ukraine troops since 2014.

WHO chief urges world

to remember Black lives

The head of the World Health Organization slammed the global community Wednesday for turning a blind eye on crises outside Ukraine. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus questioned whether "the world really gives equal attention to Black and white lives," citing dire issues of war, disease and famine in countries such as Ethiopia, Yemen, Afghanistan and Syria. He said the Horn of Africa nations are at high risk of famine and many people are "already starving or food insecure and increasingly on the move."

"I need to be blunt and honest that the world is not treating the human race the same way," he said. "Some are more equal than others."

Polish, Baltic leaders travel to show support

The presidents of Poland and the Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were in Ukraine on Wednesday to show their support in talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were part of the Soviet Union for half a century.

Now the Baltic nations fear they could be the next targets of Russia's belligerence. Together they total only about 6 million people compared with Ukraine's 44 million. The Baltics have one advantage Ukraine did not – they are NATO members. NATO leaders have made it clear the alliance would defend all its members from Russian aggression.

Latest developments

Cyprus said it is moving to revoke citizenship for four Russians and 17 of their family members included among those sanctioned by the European Union.

Russia has forcibly deported more than 500,000 Ukrainians to the Russian Federation, Zelenskyy said.

Estonia banned Russian ships from entering its ports as part of sanctions applied by the European Union (EU) against Russia in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, it was officially reported.

"As of Sunday, April 17, ships under the Russian flag are banned from entering EU ports, including Estonia," the Estonian Ministry of Economy and Infrastructure reported, according to Sputnik news agency. "This is one of the sanction measures previously approved by the European Union," the agency's text adds.

In addition, the note points out that vessels that changed the Russian flag to that of another country after February 24 are also barred entry. However, the ban does not apply if the vessels need to make an emergency or life-saving stop, the ministry said. According to Estonian Economy and Infrastructure Minister Taavi Aas, Europe is rethinking its economic activity to achieve greater independence from Russia.

Estonian govt okays application of sanctions re Russian businesses in procurements

TALLINN, Apr 28, BNS – The Estonian government on Thursday approved a bill to amend the Public Procurement Act, which will provide clear grounds for excluding from public procurements in Estonia persons of the Russian Federation subject to sanctions, as well as companies and goods connected with them.

"Today, we do not know how long the war started by Russia will last and what sanctions will be imposed in connection with it. What we do know clearly, however, is that there is no place in our public procurements for the economic operators and goods that are subject to sanctions. To exclude this, we will amend the law so that it would cover all existing and future international and government-imposed sanctions," Minister of Public Administration Jaak Aab said in a press release.

Kristel Mesilane, head of the public procurement and state aid department at the Ministry of Finance, explained that the amendments will not impose any new sanctions, but will write procedural rules into the law to allow the sanctions established by a regulation of the European Union and also government sanctions to be applied in public procurement in Estonia.

On April 8, the European Union adopted a regulation imposing restrictive measures in connection with Russia's military activities in Ukraine. The regulation also imposed sanctions in relation to public contracts, which prohibit the award of a contract or the continuation of an existing contract with a Russian citizen, resident or company, institution or other entity established there, or allowing them to perform the contract to a certain extent as a subcontractor or supplier.

In order to exclude such economic operators from participation in public procurement, the contracting authority must in the future require participants in tenders to certify the absence of a sanction and, if necessary, to provide full proof thereof.

It is also prohibited to enter into or continue a public contract if the undertaking itself is not subject to a sanction and is not connected with subjects of a sanction, but supplies goods for which an international sanction has been imposed. 

Since the immediate termination of contracts already concluded may put contracting authorities in a difficult position, a transitional period is established. This means that if an existing contract in breach of sanctions was concluded before April 9 and is valid until Oct. 10 this year, it may be continued to be fulfilled. Contracts with maturity beyond Oct. 10 must be terminated on that date at the latest. 

The legislation will step into force on June 1 this year.

Authorities monitor situation ahead of May 9 to prevent provocations

Lithuania's authorities are monitoring the situation ahead of May 9 in order to prevent provocations, Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė said on Wednesday, April 27. The State Security Department has warned of possible provocations and violent incidents on May 9 in Lithuania. According to the intelligence agency, May 9 commemorations will most likely be held at Soviet soldiers' cemeteries in Lithuania this year as well. Such commemorations are organized in various Lithuanian cities and towns by Russian diplomats together with Russian expatriates. These events are usually attended by several hundred people wearing Saint George's ribbons whose public display has recently been banned by the Lithuanian parliament because of the war in Ukraine. The ban took effect on April 21 after the legislation was signed into law by President Gitanas Nausėda. The intelligence agency has also said that some organized efforts may be seen in the run-up to May 9, noting that demonstrations in support of Russia's war in Ukraine have already been held in some EU countries.

Lithuania's GDP grew around 4 percent in Q1 2022

Lithuania's economy grew by slightly more than 4 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared to the same period last year, most economists estimate. Four out of the six experts surveyed believe that the country's GDP growth ranged from 4 to 4.4 percent in the first quarter, while one analyst said it grew by 3.2 percent, and another analyst said it grew by 1.5 percent. The majority of the experts said the war in Ukraine did not have significant impact on the Lithuanian economy in the first quarter yet, adding that industrial production and a low comparative base boosted the indicators. The economists say the country's economy grew rapidly in January-March, with good performance determined by a low comparative base as Lithuania was under a strict lockdown a year ago. Good manufacturing and export results also had impact.

Border guards turn 16 irregular migrants back to Belarus

Lithuanian border guards have in the past 24 hours turned away 16 migrants attempting to cross into the country from Belarus illegally, the State Border Guard Service (SBGS) said on Thursday, April 28. The daily number of foiled illegal crossings has been more or less stable in recent days. The SBGS also said that five shots were fired on the Belarusian side of the border near the municipality of Druskininkai at around midnight, but they did not specify whether this had anything to do with illegal migration. A total of 1,449 people have been prevented from crossing from Belarus into Lithuania at non-designated places so far this year.

Lithuanian Railways to lay off about 2,000 employees

Lietuvos Geležinkeliai (Lithuanian Railways, LTG) said on Thursday, April 28, it is planning to lay off around 2,000 of its 9,000-plus employees, with around a quarter of the state-owned group's managerial staff at various levels set to leave. The company said in a press release that 6 million euros will be allocated for severance payments to employees. The planned layoffs will affect around 1,200 workers in LTG Cargo, the group's freight transportation subsidiary, about 500 in LTG Infra, the infrastructure subsidiary, and some 300 in LTG. The group currently has around 9,200 employees in total. The company has said earlier that it may lose some 150 million euros in revenue this year as freight volumes are forecast to halve, compared to last year, to around 26.5 million tons. LTG has lost around 11 million tons in annual freight because of EU and US sanctions against Belarus' potash giant Belaruskali, which will trim its annual revenue by 61 million euros.

Estonian top diplomat calls for looking at another package on anti-Russian sanctions

Estonian Foreign Minister Eva-Maria Liimets has called for stronger economic pressure on Russia from the European Union by means of imposing more sanctions.

"Now, the European Union has demonstrated extraordinary unity when adopting new sanctions. And now, when we are imposing the sixth sanction package, it is important for us to move further immediately after that," she said on Wednesday, adding that further sanction should apply to those sectors of the Russian economy that have not yet been covered by restrictions.

The European Union is planning to impose the sixth package of anti-Russian sanctions over its special military operation in Ukraine. On Wednesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called on EU countries to begin to refuse from Russian oil, to disconnect three more Russian banks, including Sberbank, from the SWIFT system, and to ban three Russian state-run television channels in the European Union.

Loonela: Reaching deal on oil embargo against Russia a matter of days

TALLINN, May 09, BNS - Reaching an agreement on an oil embargo to be imposed against Russia is a matter of days, Vivian Loonela, head of the European Commission representation in Estonia, said on the "Otse Postimehest" ("Live from Postimees") webcast of Postimees on Monday.

"Yes, but it will come, because if we look at sanctions on Russia, the European Union aims to do everything possible with these sanctions to hinder the Russian economy so that they will not be able to wage this or other wars. We have already adopted five sanctions packages and are now at the sixth," Loonela said.

According to her, the calculation underway is about how to do everything to ensure that the sanctions would have a detrimental effect on the Russian economy, while at the same time damaging the economies of the European Union countries as little as possible. "It is precisely these details that are currently being discussed -- how to agree on an oil embargo so that European countries such as Hungary, which are still heavily dependent on oil from Russia, can go along with this sanction without bringing their own economies down," Loonela said.

According to her, discussions are currently taking place on how long the transition period should be and how to agree on this sanction as soon as possible. "It has been unanimously agreed that it is necessary to proceed with sanctions. This was also confirmed by the heads of state when they last met at the European Council. The technical details are now being discussed, how far we need to go and how to help those member states that need this help. The aim is to ensure that the economies of Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia do not suffer unduly," Loonela said.

"It is important that we are nearing the end and that the European Union will impose an oil embargo, it is now only a matter of days before it is agreed. This is a strong step on Europe's part, we are taking this war very seriously and we will do everything we can to help Ukraine, we will take steps to prevent Russia from being able to wage this war," the head of the European Commission in Estonia, said.

According to her, five packages have been adopted so far and it is clear that their economic impact on Russia is tens and hundreds of times greater than the setback for European countries. "Even if the Russian market seems to be large from the Estonian perspective, looking at Europe's own internal market, to which European companies send goods and services, we see that the Russian market is quite small in this comparison," Loonela added.

TALLINN, Jun 01, BNS - Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said during parliament question time on Wednesday that timber supplies from Russia and Belarus declined 20 percent in May as a result of  sanctions imposed against transport companies.

"With the sanction on land transport entering into force on May 1, the volume of timber has since decreased close to 20 percent compared to earlier volumes," Kallas said, adding that it is not timber that has been sanctioned but the transport thereof.

"Thus, if it is done by enterprises who have contracts but with Estonian companies conducting the transport, then it is not subject to this sanction," she said.

Meanwhile, freight volumes have grown in other product groups.

"Looking at other product groups, freight transport in total intensified in April due to entrepreneurs stocking up on goods from Belarus and Russia which they will no longer be able to buy later on," Kallas said.

Estonia: Transport companies seeking visas, work permits for Belarusian drivers
636 字
2022 年 6 月 3 日 12:17 GMT
Baltic Business Daily
BALDAI
英文
(c) 2022 Baltic News Service
TALLINN, Jun 03, BNS – The Association of Estonian International Road Carriers (ERAA) turned to the minister of foreign affairs because the association wants visas and work permits to be issued to Belarusian drivers to enable them to work in Estonian companies.

"The shortage of drivers has become a global problem in the transport sector, both in Europe and globally. According to the International Road Transport Union (IRU), approximately a fifth, or 425,000, of driver job positions in the European Union are vacant. As an extreme effect, the problem has increasingly started creating obstacles to ensuring security of supply and the timely delivery of goods," ERAA secretary general and management board member Ermo Perolainen said in the letter sent to the ministry.

Thus, the possibilities of hiring foreign labor from third countries have become a very important indicator of competitiveness, which, according to Perolainen, are significantly more difficult and restrictive in Estonia compared to neighboring countries, which is why Estonian transport companies have lost market share to Lithuanian, Polish, Latvian and other carriers in recent years.

"Estonian companies use an estimated 8,000 trucks in international road transport and the number of drivers is in the same range. Altogether 25 percent, or 2,000 of them, come from third countries, and this number has grown steadily in recent years. Of these foreign labor drivers, 1,200 are citizens of Ukraine and 400 are citizens of Russia and 400 citizens of Belarus," the secretary general of the association said.

However, many Ukrainian drivers have left for their home country and the extension of visas and work permits for Russian and Belarusian drivers has been suspended, not to mention the possibility of hiring new drivers. "As the recruitment of Belarusian drivers, at least, is known to be possible in Latvia and Poland, for example, then with this restriction, the state of Estonia is harming the activities and competitiveness of its companies, which have spent significant amounts on training and hiring drivers, but are now forced to give them up and once again start looking for and training new drivers while drivers who have experience and who have been working there until then go work for the competing companies of neighboring countries," Perolainen said.

In addition to the Ukrainian drivers leaving for home, the visas and short-term work registrations of 400 Belarusian and 400 Russian drivers will expire in the next six months, so replacements will have to be found for potentially some 2,000 drivers. In the search for drivers, carriers have reached more distant countries, such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, India, and finding and training drivers from these countries as well as getting them settled in takes significantly more time and resources, according to the ERAA representative.

Thus, ERAA proposes to allow Belarusian drivers the documents necessary for employment in Estonian companies, such as the issuance and extension of a visa and short-term employment registration.

In early April, the government approved a sanction restricting the opportunities for Russian and Belarusian citizens to work or do business in Estonia and suspending the issuance of relevant visas and residence permits.

According to a June 2 decision, the government is allowing Russian and Belarusian citizens admitted to Estonia on humanitarian grounds to be issued work and business visas or fixed-term residence permits. By the amendment to the sanctions regulation, also Russian and Belarusian journalists accredited by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, such as those working for the Associated Press, will receive work permits in Estonia as an exception. The derogation also applies to Belarusian citizens to whom the Police and Border Guard has issued long-term visas for employment in the field of ICT.

* Estonian authorities said Tuesday that a Russian border guard helicopter violated its airspace at the weekend

* The NATO state's defence ministry said this was one of several similar incidents of Russian infringement

* Latest incursion into Estonian airspace by a military helicopter comes days ahead of the next NATO summit

* German economy minister accused Russian energy giant Gazprom of trying to 'create chaos' on the continent

* 'Reduction of gas deliveries via Nord Stream 1 pipeline is an attack on us,' minister Robert Habeck said

* Germany, Austria and the Netherlands have fired up mothballed coal plants to reduce their gas consumption

* It comes as Russia vowed to retaliate after Lithuania blocked goods EU goods from reaching Kaliningrad

* A Russian general said the West is playing with fire by preventing goods from reaching the Russian exclave

Estonian authorities said Tuesday that a Russian border guard helicopter violated the nation's airspace over the weekend and simulated missile attacks, triggering a summons for the NATO state's Russian ambassador.

Estonia's military said in a statement that the Russian MI-8 helicopter entered the country's airspace in southeastern Estonia in the Koidula area - not far from the Russian city of Pskov - without permission on Saturday evening.

The helicopter was in Estonia's airspace for almost two minutes, Estonia's military said, adding that it hadn't presented a flight plan, had its transponder switched off and failed to maintain radio contact with Estonian Air Navigation Services.

The alleged intrusion was one of multiple violations of Estonia's airspace this year and comes less than a week before a scheduled NATO summit in Madrid.

The MI-8 has been one of Russia's foremost aerial vehicles deployed in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine to transport small contingents of troops and to provide close air support with missiles and machine gun fire.

Kusti Salm, permanent secretary at Estonia's defence ministry, told journalists: 'This week there have been multiple border violations by helicopters... and also a lot of provocative behaviour along the border. Apparently they are trying to create some sort of context head of the summit.

'During the ongoing exercises, Russia is simulating missile attacks against Estonia. This is something that has become daily... This is the picture of the threat. It has never been as serious as it is now,' he added.

Last year, Russian aircraft - military and civilian - violated Estonia's airspace five times, the military said.

On Friday, Russia's ambassador to Denmark was summoned to the Danish foreign ministry after a Russian military vessel twice violated the country's territorial waters off the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm.

The incident happened while many Danish lawmakers were on the island for an annual gathering of politicians and lobbyists.

It comes as Germany's economy minister accused Russian energy giant Gazprom of mounting an 'attack' on his nation after it slashed its supply of gas to Europe.

'The reduction of gas deliveries via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline is an attack on us, an economic attack on us,' Robert Habeck said in a speech to a German industry conference earlier today.

Gazprom said last week it would reduce supplies of the fuel to Germany via the pipeline due to delayed repairs, but the German government has called the decision 'political' amid the widespread European support for Ukraine following Putin's invasion.

As a result of the cut, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands decided to reactivate mothballed coal power plants to reduce their gas consumption.

Germany has also mandated the filling of gas reserves to 90 per cent ahead of the European winter, to hedge against a further reduction in supply.

'When we go into the winter with half full gas stores and the taps are turned off then we are talking about a difficult economic crisis in Germany,' Habeck said.

Russia meanwhile has vowed to retaliate against Lithuania with measures that 'will have a serious negative impact on the Lithuanian population' after the country blocked EU-sanctioned goods from reaching the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.

Russia's Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said Moscow will respond shortly to Lithuania's move to block deliveries of coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology from mainland Russia to Kaliningrad.

'Russia will certainly respond to such hostile actions. Relevant measures are being worked out in the interdepartmental format and will be taken in the near future,' Interfax cited Patrushev, a former KGB spy, as saying.

'Their consequences will have a serious negative impact on the population of Lithuania,' he added.

Patrushev's warning comes as retired Russian general Evgeny Buzhinsky urged Putin to send nuclear weapons to Kaliningrad.

Lt-Gen Buzhinsky told Russian state TV that the West is playing with fire after deliveries of coal, metals, construction materials and advanced technology were stopped from entering the Russian territory via NATO state Lithuania.

Buzhinsky said Lithuania's decision to ban the delivery of sanctioned goods to Kaliningrad, a Russian outpost on the Baltic Sea surrounded by EU territory, was a 'threat' to Russia's national security.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov meanwhile warned that all trust has now evaporated between the West and Moscow.

'Relations between Russia and the West will not be back to the previous level, because Moscow will never again trust such 'partners',' he told MSNBC. 'It will be a lengthy crisis, but we will never trust the West again.'

The threats come after the Kremlin warned of 'very tough actions' against Lithuania if it did not reverse its 'openly hostile move'.

Patrushev, one of Putin's top allies, arrived in Kaliningrad on Tuesday to discuss national security amid the row with NATO member Lithuania.

He will chair a meeting about security in Russia's northwest in Kaliningrad, the state RIA news agency said.

RIA said the trip, which included a discussion about transport, was planned before Vilnius banned the transit of goods sanctioned by the European Union through Lithuanian territory to and from the exclave, citing EU sanction rules.

Russia's foreign ministry on Tuesday also summoned the European Union ambassador to Moscow, Markus Ederer, over the 'anti-Russian restrictions' on the transit of sanctioned goods to Kaliningrad.

'The inadmissibility of such actions, which violate the relevant legal and political obligations of the European Union and lead to an escalation of tensions, was pointed out,' the ministry said in a statement.

In response, Ederer urged Russia on Tuesday to refrain from 'escalatory steps and rhetoric' over what Moscow calls 'anti-Russian restrictions', an EU spokesperson said.

'He conveyed our position on Russia's aggression against Ukraine and explained that Lithuania is implementing EU sanctions and there is no blockade, and asked them to refrain from escalatory steps and rhetoric,' spokesperson Peter Stano said.

The Lithuanian government stressed in a written statement Tuesday that 'the transit of passengers and non-sanctioned goods to and from the Kaliningrad region through Lithuania continues uninterrupted,' and that the ban on transit of sanctioned goods was merely part the fourth package of EU sanctions against Russia.

Top Lithuanian officials decried Russia's reaction to the measure as an attempt by the Kremlin to wind up a propaganda campaign trying to create an image of a 'blockade' mainly for internal consumption.

'It's ironic to hear rhetoric about alleged violations of international treaties from a country which has violated possibly every single international treaty,' Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte told reporters.

'There is no Kaliningrad blockade,' Simonyte said. 'Lithuania is implementing EU sanctions.'

Estonian expert says Russia to respond to Lithuania's transit ban

While Russia can respond to the transit ban for goods between mainland Russia and its Kaliningrad exclave with military measures, it is unlikely to attack Lithuania, a security expert has told an Estonian daily. The following is the text of an unattributed article based on an interview with Kalev Stoicescu, a research fellow of the International Centre for Defence and Security, entitled "Kalev Stoicescu: Russia may take military steps against Lithuania" and published by Eesti Paevaleht on 21 June; subheadings have been added editorially:

On 17 June, Lithuania imposed a transit ban on its territory for EU-sanctioned goods between Kaliningrad [Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast] and [mainland] Russia. There have been annoyed responses from Kaliningrad and Russia with the transit ban described as a provocation. We asked the security expert Kalev Stoicescu's opinion on this.

In Stoicescu's words the issue is not whether Russia will respond to Lithuania's sanctions, the question is how it will respond. "It can also take military steps. Firstly, it can move troops that are already stationed close to the Lithuanian border in Belarus. Thereby indicating that Russia is prepared to intervene militarily to protects its interests," Stoicescu replied. In his words, this may remind of crazy episodes from European history, namely 1939 when Hitler demanded from Poland a corridor to Gdansk, given that also now the central issue is about a transit corridor.

"Another military measure could be that Russia may initiate exercises of its Baltic fleet. To bring the vessels back to the sea. The same way how we saw that 45 vessels were brought out when the BALTOPS 2022 [maritime] exercise by Nato and its partners took place. [Russia] could do the same and take these vessels to international waters to the west of Lithuania's territorial waters, and perhaps it could even conduct exercises with battle shooting there. Thereby disrupting or even preventing sea traffic to Lithuanian ports," Stoicescu said. In his words, the objective could be to disrupt the sea traffic leading to [Lithuania's] LNG terminal [in Klaipeda].

"To respond in a way that if you block our land transit, then we will block your sea trade and traffic. This too is possible," Stoicescu said. In his words it is important to understand that Russia does not view the blocking of Kaliningrad as a EU sanction, but as a provocation that certainly requires a response.

It is important for Russia to respond

Stoicescu believes that Russia has a plan to respond with an equivalent provocation. Yet he does not believe that Russia would attack Lithuania any time soon. In his words, for Russia it is more important to show off its military muscle, whether it is about higher battle readiness of its battle units near the Belarusian border or something else.

The best timing in Stoicescu's words would be right before the Nato summit, which will be held in Madrid next week. "Russia's logic is to escalate and show its potential, to again create new problems and make the situation even tenser. This is indeed their logic," Stoicescu said.

To the question whether Russia could create an artificial migrant crisis for pressurising Lithuania, Stoicescu answered with a certain scepticism, but nor did he rule it out. In his words this is one of the possible choices, but certainly more challenging for Russia, because Poland, Lithuania and Latvia have learned a lot from the previous migrant crisis.

According to Stoicescu, the key point is that Russia will definitely respond to the transit ban. "But one way or another, Russia will certainly respond, this is something that Russia cannot leave without a reaction. And I think that this will probably happen over the next days, i.e. before the Nato summit," Stoicescu said.

Lithuania suspends transit of EU-sanctioned goods

Lithuania announced on Friday, 17 June, that it will suspend on its territory transit from Russia to Kaliningrad. The list of EU sanctions includes, for instance, coal, construction materials, metals, high technology, cement.

Transit between the Russian Federation and Kaliningrad is permitted by the 2002 agreement that was concluded at the summit between the Russian Federation and the European Union. Based on this, Lithuania cannot act autonomously, its decisions must be in line with the European Union.

According to the EU's high representative [for foreign affairs and security policy] Josep Borrell, this is not a trade embargo but simply a matter of imposing sanctions. In Borrell's view, the EU has imposed certain restrictions on goods while Lithuania is following these instructions. Lithuania's foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis noted that on the same day sanctions were enforced for iron ore, steel and other products - hence the transit ban for such goods.

Russia still called the transit ban an embargo, referring to it as illegal and requesting its immediate termination. Kaliningrad's governor Anton Alikhanov has said that approximately half of the goods imported to Kaliningrad have been affected. Moscow has promised to announce its own restrictions in the next few days.

TALLINN, Jul 07, BNS – The transition period that made it possible to import certain sanctioned goods to the European Union or export them to the Russian Federation on the basis of previously concluded agreements will end at 11:59 p.m. on July 10.

The changes also affect natural persons who cross the border for travel or other purposes. The Estonian Tax and Customs Board asks all border crossers to take the stricter restrictions into consideration already when planning their trip.

While sanctions usually concern companies and trade, then from Monday, it will no longer be possible for private individuals to import or export certain goods either.

The lists of prohibited goods also include such goods that have so far been brought from Russia or taken there on a daily basis. For example, old or new furniture or its parts, timber or wood products, fertilizers containing potassium, new pneumatic tires, cement, caviar, new or used containers such as glass bottles and cans and the like cannot be brought in from the Russian Federation.

Passengers must also pay attention to the restrictions on alcohol, meaning from July 10, it is forbidden to bring in alcoholic beverages such as vodka, gin or liqueurs from Russia, regardless of the quantity. It is allowed to bring beer, wine and cider in previously established amounts, that is 16 liters of beer, four liters of wine, two liters of cider.

In addition, the Tax and Customs Board reminds passengers that it is already forbidden to take to Russia more than the cash required for the trip, household electronics worth more than 750 euros, such as smartphones and laptops, and other items worth more than 300 euros. The restriction does not apply to personal items, including a smartphone in use, a valuable handbag, or outerwear.

The Tax and Customs Board will ensure the availability of information for passengers at the Narva, Luhamaa and Koidula border crossing points and provide explanations. The authority also points out that a violation of an international sanction is subject to either a financial penalty or up to five years in prison. A financial penalty is prescribed for the same act if it is committed by a legal entity.

TALLINN, Jul 19, BNS – The Riigikogu on Tuesday passed a bill to amend the Public Procurement Act, initiated by the government, which enables the implementation of the sanctions imposed on Russia by the European Union.

Under an EU sanction, it is prohibited to award any public contract to or continue the execution of any public contract with a person who is a citizen or resident of the Russian Federation or an undertaking established there.

The legislative amendments passed on Tuesday provide that, in the event of doubt, contracting authorities and entities will have the right to require additional data and certificates from the economic operators participating in procurement procedures to check that no sanction is involved.

The grounds for exclusion and for rejection of tenders were also amended by including both international and government sanctions. In addition, it will be possible to extraordinarily terminate early the contracts already awarded to which subjects of sanctions are parties.

The bill was passed in the 101-seat legislative body by 70 votes in favor and none against.

TALLINN, Jul 27, BNS – Estonia's Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu has voiced his appreciation of Wednesday's decision by the General Court of the European Union (EU), which maintained the ban on media funded by Russia broadcasting for non-Russian audiences.

"The decision of the Grand Chamber of the General Court confirmed the European Union sanction banning the broadcasting in the EU of Russian-funded media channels oriented to other countries," Reinsalu said according to spokespeople for the ministry.

"Among others, in the court proceedings, Estonia supported upholding the sanction and underlined the grave impact of the activities of media channels relaying propaganda on Estonian, EU and Ukrainian society," the minister said.

"In order to justify and support military aggression against Ukraine, Russia is systematically spreading false information in a bid to hide and distort the truth about the atrocities of war and crimes against humanity in Ukraine. False information spread by Russia poses a significant threat to the public order and security of the entire European Union. With the help of European Union sanctions, we can face this threat together," Reinsalu said.

Estonia no longer issuing visas to Russian, Belarusian citizens for purpose of study

TALLINN, Jul 28, BNS - The Estonian government approved on Thursday a sanction restricting Russian citizens' opportunities to apply for a temporary residence permit or visa for the purpose of studying in Estonia.

In addition, the sanction has been specified to only enable the registration of Russian and Belarusian nationals' short-term employment in Estonia if they have a valid visa issued by Estonia, spokespeople for the government said.

Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu highlighted that Russia's unjustifiable war against Ukraine whereby Russia is grossly violating the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine also negatively impacts the security of Estonia and the European Union.

"Continued sanctions against Russia are crucial for putting incessant pressure on Russia. If the sanctions help end Russia's aggression, it will have a positive impact on our security, too," he said.

The amendment to the sanction specifies that the short-term employment of a Russian or Belarusian citizen whose basis for staying in Estonia has been granted by another member state will no longer be registered and, thus, they are no longer able to apply for a long-term visa for the purpose of short-term employment.

"This amendment will end the situation where, in order to circumvent a valid sanction, people apply for a short-term Schengen visa for example for the purpose of tourism from another member state," Reinsalu said.

Citizens of Russia can no longer receive visas or residence permits for the purpose of studying in Estonia

Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu emphasized that Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine, not only grossly violates Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence, but also threatens the security of Estonia and of the European Union. Reinsalu states, "The continuation of sanctions against Russia is essential to ensuring relentless pressure on the country. If the sanctions help in stopping Russian aggression, a positive effect on our own security will ensue."

With the amendment of the sanction, it is specified that the short-term employment of citizens of Russia and Belarus with a legal residence permit issued by another member state will no longer be registered, and therefore they will additionally not be able to apply for a long-term visa for the purpose of short-term employment.

"With this amendment, we will eliminate scenarios where a short-term Schengen visa is applied for, for tourism purposes, for example, from another member state in order to bypass the current sanction," added Reinsalu.

RUSSIAN tennis players have been banned from competing in a second nation.

Estonia has become the second country to follow in the footsteps of Wimbledon and the British government in banning all Russian and Belarusian players from competing in their upcoming tennis tournaments. The Baltic country is hosting several lower-level ITF and Futures events next month, and is hoping to send a “clear message” with the ban. But unlike Wimbledon, the tournaments will be able to keep their ranking points awarded to players.

Estonia is staging two ITF tournaments next month, as well as a men’s Futures event and a women’s W25. All Russian and Belarusian players will be banned from competing in the four tournaments, with the country’s acting culture minister accusing the Russian government of using sporting success for their own gain.

“International sports are now in no way separated from politics, Russia and Belarus use sports to achieve their strategic goals. With this decision, we are sending a clear message,” Liina Kersna said in a statement. The move comes after players from the two nations were banned from competing in Britain over the grass season.

Acting under government guidelines, the All England Club banned all Russians and Belarusians from competing in The Championships, with the LTA following suit and barring them from any grass warm-up events in the country, including the likes of Queen’s and Eastbourne. But unlike Wimbledon, the four tournaments in Estonia will not have their ranking points stripped.

JUST IN: Emma Raducanu's 'tough love' from parents as she plots tennis return

The ITF has decided not to remove points on offer for the players who can compete at the tournaments next month, in contrast to the ATP and WTA’s decision to remove points on offer at Wimbledon this year and remove any points won last year from their players’ tallies. The LTA’s grass-court warm-up events in Britain were also able to keep their ranking points, and the ITF has now clarified their decision regarding Estonia.

The Estonian Tennis Federation boss explained that the ITF events were allowed to keep their ranking points with tournaments of the same level taking place in other nations at the same time, giving alternative options for those who are banned from the country. Allar Hint told Delfi: “In the case of Parnu and other smaller tournaments, athletes have an alternative to play elsewhere. That’s one reason why the points remained.”

Estonia is yet to confirm whether the ban will extend to the Tallinn Open, a WTA 250 event held in the final week of September. The WTA has been stricter in their views over countries and tournaments banning Russian and Belarusian players, and could sanction the Tallinn event for any ban, but Hint has claimed that they are working on a “solution”.

The WTA Tour removed Wimbledon’s ranking points to protect “the equal opportunities that WTA players should have to compete as individuals”, with the head of the women’s tour saying: “If we do not take this stance, then we abandon our fundamental principle and allow the WTA to become an example to support discrimination based on nationality at other events and in other regions around the world. The WTA will continue to apply its rules to reject such discrimination.”

ESTONIA: SANCTIONED FERTILIZER STUCK IN MUUGA HARBOR CANNOT BE USED

Estonian ministries and the agricultural sector are trying to find a solution to dispose of 80,000 tons of sanctioned Russian fertilizer stuck in Estonia's Muuga Harbor, which, if not stored correctly, could become dangerous. The government said it could not be used by Estonian farmers.

Due to sanctions placed on Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, Russian fertilizer has been sanctioned and is now sitting in Tallinn's Muuga Harbor.

Of the 80,000 tons, 12,000 tons are ammonium nitrate, which can become dangerous if stored in one place for a long time and can cause explosions.

The Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce believes the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Ministry of Rural Affairs should allow farmers to use it for its intended use. This would reduce the risk, it said.

Prices have risen significantly since the war, as much of the fertilizer imported to Europe comes from Russia coupled with rising energy prices, the chamber points out.

"In a situation where ammonium nitrate is supplied to Estonia at very high prices from unrestricted countries, it is unreasonable to declare the fertilizer as hazardous waste and to incur costs related to its disposal, while in agriculture it is possible to turn a dangerous substance into a necessary commodity," the chamber wrote in an appeal to the ministries.

The organization said, in addition to Muuga Habor, ammonium nitrate was also stored at Sillamae in Ida-Viru County. The amount is approximately 69,000 tons in total, which essentially covers the amount used per year by Estonian agriculture.

However, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said the EU's sanctions generally did not allow for the change of ownership of sanctioned goods or for countries to confiscate them.

The government is now working with companies to safely store the fertilizer and to find a legal solution for its future while taking sanction rules into account, says Laura Laaster, head of the ministry's public relations department.

She said a solution was being sought to move the stored fertilizer from the port.

"Solutions are in the works, but it will take time, because every possible solution must be coordinated with the Money Laundering Data Bureau, which is the institution that supervises the implementation of financial sanctions in Estonia," Laaster said. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

Several Eastern European countries already enabled visa restrictions

EU visa ban is unlikely to happen in the near future

Estonian Foreign minister Reinsalu proposed to ban the issuance of EU visas to Russian citizens, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. He considers that Russia should become "even more isolated" from other countries. Estonian authorities already forbade issuing new student visas and resident cards for Russian and Belarusian citizens this July. The Latvian foreign ministry suggested the same measure early, and Lithuania, Czech Republic, Poland and Romania already enabled the restriction. Finland is currently mulling the decision as well. Presidential spokesperson Peskov warned earlier that Russia would mirror such restrictions. However, the European Commission likely does not support harsh action, saying that sanctions should target only state officials and oligarchs. As the sanction package requires unanimous support, EU's visa ban seems unlikely to be included in the eighth sanction package, due in late August.

Estonian FinMin says putting sanctioned fertilizer into use not possible

TALLINN, Aug 11, BNS - Following media reports in July about fertilizers being stuck at Muuga Harbor due to sanctions against Russia, several agricultural producers expressed interest in putting the sanctioned fertilizer into use, however, it is not possible according to the law, the Ministry of Finance said.

At the end of July, the Estonian Chamber for Agriculture and Commerce turned to the ministry over some members of the organization having expressed interest in putting the sanctioned fertilizer into use in Estonia.

"This communication appears to be motivated by an understanding that the assets of businesses belonging to sanctioned individuals are about to be 'nationalized' in the near future. We want to explain that freezing economic resources in the meaning of implementing international sanctions does not mean the nationalization of these resources. Transferring such resources into state ownership would require launching criminal proceedings, which may result in the confiscation of the assets of the individual convicted of a crime," deputy secretary general of the Ministry of Finance Merike Saks said.

An international sanction, including a financial one, is a foreign policy measure that does not change the ownership of assets and when sanctions are terminated, all individuals and institutions have the obligation to cease freezing assets, after which the owner is able to continue using them.

"The Ministry of Finance does not conduct criminal proceedings, which is why we do not have any information on whether or not there is a basis for launching criminal proceedings in this case, if any such proceedings have been launched or if there are any plans to do so. There is also no information about the owner wanting to give up the movable property, which is why there are no grounds for occupying the fertilizer as movable property," the deputy secretary general added.

The ministry also underscores that if the frozen assets are chemicals that are hazardous to the environment, such as fertilizers, public institutions need to find legal options for eliminating the threat, if necessary, but they must also take into consideration the potentially temporary nature of international sanctions as well as their specific purpose.

Estonia stops issuing visas for Russian citizens, bars entry to state via external border

TALLINN, Aug 11, BNS - The Estonian government on Thursday approved a sanction restricting the issuance of visas to citizens of the Russian Federation as well as entry to the state across the external border with Estonian-issued Schengen visas from Aug. 18.

As an exception, residence permits will be extended by one year for students who are concluding their studies in Estonian higher education establishments.

Entry to Estonia will remain permitted for citizens of the Russian Federation holding a long-term residence permit and those coming to Estonia to visit their close relatives as well as Russian diplomats working in Estonia and their family members, workers involved in the international transport of goods and passengers, people who have the right to freedom of movement under EU law as well as people entering Estonia for humanitarian reasons.

"We've observed a massive growth in the number of Russian citizens transiting through or arriving in Estonia," Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu said. "Russian citizens' opportunity to visit Estonia in large numbers or to visit Europe through Estonia is incompatible with the meaning of the sanctions we've established. By establishing the sanctions, Estonia wanted for the aggressor state to be unable to continue its ordinary international life also at the level of its citizens."

Reinsalu added that Estonia will also stop issuing visas to the aggressor state's citizens for the purpose of work, study and entrepreneurship in Estonia.

Minister of the Interior Lauri Laanemets said that the sanctions established in spring have put the students from Russia who have not been able to finish their studies within the nominal duration of their study program in an unexpected situation.

"For many of these young people, returning home may prove dangerous in the present situation because they have spoken up in defense of Ukraine and criticized the Russian aggression and regime. Doing so is punishable as a criminal offense in Russia and, thus, it was necessary to extend the residence permits of these students by one year as an exception to enable them to finish their studies here," Laanemets added.

The sanction is slated to enter into force on Aug. 18.

The Estonian authorities have made a decision to ban Russian citizens with Estonia-issued Schengen visas from entering its territory, Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu said on Thursday.

"In a week from now the sanction will be applied to Schengen visas issued by Estonia. Visa holders from Russia will be subject to restrictions. They will be denied entry to Estonia," the ERR portal quotes Reinsalu as saying.

He added that a number of exceptions would be made to this rule. In particular, the staffers of diplomatic offices in Estonia and their families, as well as persons engaged in international transportation or having the right to free movement under EU laws will be exempt from the ban. Also, the restrictions will not apply to persons whose entry into Estonia is necessary for humanitarian reasons and close relatives of the country’s citizens or holders of Estonia’s permanent residence permit.

Estonia to ban Russians with tourist visas from entering

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Estonia decided Thursday to bar people from neigboring Russia with tourist visas from entering the northernmost Baltic country as a consequence of the war in Ukraine.

“Russian citizens’ opportunity to visit Estonia in large numbers or to visit Europe through Estonia is incompatible with the meaning of the sanctions we’ve established,” Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu was quoted as saying by the Baltic News Service said.

The European Union, of which Estonia is a member, already has banned air travel from Russia after it invaded Ukraine. But Russians can still travel by land to Estonia and apparently are then take flights to other European destinations.

By imposing the sanction, Estonia wants Russia “to be unable to continue its ordinary international life also at the level of its citizens,” Reinsalu said according to BNS, the region's main news agency. He added that they had observed “a massive growth in the number of Russian citizens transiting through or arriving in Estonia.”

BNS said exceptions to Thursday's sanction included Russian citizens with a long-term residence permit; those coming to visit close relatives; workers involved in the international transport of goods and passengers, as well as people entering the country for humanitarian reasons.

The Estonian sanction applies beginning Aug. 18. Estonia and Russia share a nearly 300 kilometer (186-mile) long border.

“I call on other governments to follow such steps,” Reinsalu wrote on Twitter.

Earlier this week, Estonian and Finnish leaders urged fellow European countries to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens, saying they should not be able to take vacations in Europe while the Russian government carries out a war in Ukraine.

Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas wrote Tuesday on Twitter that “visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right” and that it is “time to end tourism from Russia now.”

A day earlier, her counterpart in Finland, Sanna Marin, told Finnish broadcaster YLE that “it is not right that while Russia is waging an aggressive, brutal war of aggression in Europe, Russians can live a normal life, travel in Europe, be tourists.”

Russian companies reportedly have started offering car trips from St. Petersburg to the airports in Helsinki and Lappeenranta in Finland, which have direct connections to several places in Europe. Russia’s second-largest city is 300 kilometers (186 miles) from the Finnish capital.

Visas issued by Finland and Estonia are valid across most of Europe’s visa-free travel zone, known as the “Schengen area” which is made up of 26 countries: 22 EU nations plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Normally, people and goods move freely between these countries without border checks. Nineteen other countries outside this travel area allow in foreigners using a Schengen visa.

Because of the war, Latvia has already decided it no longer is issuing visas to Russians. Poland said Wednesday that it was no longer issuing tourist visas to Russians.

The Estonian authorities have made a decision to ban Russian citizens with Estonia-issued Schengen visas from entering its territory, Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu told a government news briefing on Thursday.

"In a week from now the sanction will be applied to Schengen visas issued by Estonia. Visa holders from Russia will be subject to restrictions. They will be denied entry to Estonia," he said.

Reinsalu added that a number of exceptions would be made to this rule. In particular, the staffers of diplomatic offices in Estonia and their families, as well as persons engaged in international transportation or having the right to free movement under EU laws will be exempt from the ban. Also, the restrictions will not apply to persons whose entry into Estonia is necessary for humanitarian reasons and close relatives of the country’s citizens or holders of Estonia’s permanent residence permit.

Reinsalu said that Estonia had data on more than 50,000 valid Schengen visas issued to Russian citizens.

Earlier, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said that she considered it necessary to ban the issuance of EU tourist visas to Russian citizens. Later, German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said that a proposal to that effect had been submitted for discussion in the EU. A representative of the European Commission, while commenting on the possibility of such restrictions on Thursday, told the media that the EU countries must comply with their international obligations and ensure the issuance of visas to members of the EU citizens’ families, humanitarian workers, journalists and residents. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in reply to Kallas’s proposal that a number of countries that Moscow had already declared unfriendly, displayed amnesia in their unfriendliness.

Estonia will ban Russians with Estonian–issued Schengen visas from entering the country, the government announced on Thursday, August 11. The rule does not affect permanent residents and shall enter into force on August 18, informs broadcaster ERR.

«This sanction means that the visas will remain valid, but the visa holders will be sanctioned when entering Estonia, they will not be allowed to enter Estonia,» said Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu at the government's weekly press conference.

The decision does not apply to Russian citizens with visas issued by other EU members. But this issue will be raised with the EU later this month, he said.

It will also not affect Russian citizens whose homeland is Estonia or who are permanent residents of Estonia, Reinsalu said.

Exceptions to the rule include:

The government is now pushing for all EU member states to adopt the rule.

«We agreed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Interior will prepare their possible proposals for next week regarding the question of how it would be possible to close the Estonian border to those citizens of the Russian Federation who have a Schengen visa that has not been issued in Estonia,» the minister said.

Additional border checks to start next week

Veiko Kommusaar, undersecretary for Internal Security of the Ministry of the Interior, said additional visa checks will take place from next week at the Narva, Luhamaa and Koidula crossings which border Russia.

No extra inspections will take place at the Port of Tallinn or on the southern border in Ikla and Valga, he said.

«If another member state has taken responsibility and admitted Russian citizens to the Schengen area and has granted a residence permit for this, then in the context of Schengen free movement, people have the right to visit other countries as well,» Kommusaar said.

Estonia has issued 53,000 valid short–term visas and just over half will be affected by the new regulations.

An additional exception has been made for Russian students studying in Estonia who will be able to extend their residence permits for one year.

Minister of the Interior Lauri Läänemets said Russian students who have not managed to complete their studies in the nominal time have been left in an awkward position due to the sanctions imposed in spring.

Minister said that for students who are currently studying Estonia, returning home may be dangerous if they have expressed their support to Ukraine and criticized the Russian regime and its aggression.

«People there are facing prison sentences for doing so, which is why it was necessary, as an exception, to extend those students' residence permits by one year, so that they can complete their studies.»

Last month the government said visa extensions would not be granted for Russian students studying in Estonia, leading to complaints from the students union.

The post Estonia will ban Russian citizens to enter with Estonian–issued visas appeared first on Baltic News Network - News from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia.

Estonian minister: Russians bear 'moral responsibility' for war

Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu (Isamaa party) has told Estonian TV that Russian citizens should be banned from entering the country since their "passivity" means they bear "moral responsibility" for the war in Ukraine. Speaking on ETV's "Aktuaalne kaamera" programme, Reinsalu said he does not agree with the view that Russian citizens should be differentiated from President Vladimir Putin. The following is the text of a report in English titled "Reinsalu on visa ban: Russian citizens cannot be differentiated from Putin" and published by the ERR News website, operated by Estonian Public Broadcasting on 12 August:

Foreign minister Urmas Reinsalu (Isamaa) said ordinary Russian citizens cannot be treated as a separate category from that country's leader, Vladimir Putin, the aggressor in the current conflict in Ukraine.

Reinsalu was referring to a ban on entry of Russian citizens holding Estonia-issued Schengen visas, announced on Thursday and to come into force on August 18.

The foreign minister made his remarks in an interview with ETV news show "Aktuaalne kaamera" on Thursday (August 11) which follows in its entirety.

[ETV] Let's start with the visa restrictions. Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has made it clear that he does not support the suspension of Russian tourist visas. Have you considered the possibility that Russia's border countries will be left alone in the EU, a regards this proposal?

[Reinsalu] I want to count on the widest possible support. I am not in an agreement with an approach whereby we look at "ordinary" Russian citizens and distinguish them from Putin. The war is being prosecuted by the Russian Federation, as a state. Without a doubt, Russian citizens, by their passivity, bear moral responsibility for this. This means that Estonia's message is that Europe must impose sanctions, and our message, as the Estonian state, insofar as it is within our competence to impose these sanctions, is that Russian citizens are not welcome with us.

[ETV] How do you intend to persuade your colleagues in, for example, Germany, though I would imagine this would also apply to Cyprus, Greece, maybe Italy?

[Reinsalu] From the moral perspective. By fact that it is completely morally unacceptable that we allow hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens to travel on tourist trips while children are being blown to pieces in Ukraine with missiles, literally paid for by the tax money from these same Russian citizens.

[ETV] How long can Estonia impose this sanction alone?

[Reinsalu] Estonia can impose a sanction relating to visas issued by the Estonian state for an indefinite period. By doing so, we will essentially draw the line for the majority, the lion's share, of the Schengen visas we issue, effective next week, period. Second, we are analysing making pan-European proposals.

And third, from next week the cabinet will start discussing options for barring the entry of Russian citizens across the Estonian border altogether, with legal procedures. This requires a legal analysis from the point of view of the Schengen visa regulations, though I have this goal in mind.

[ETV] What will happen to those Russian students who have already started studying in Estonia, when the annual grace period ends? Applying for asylum is cumbersome and time-consuming. Why can't we allow them to stay longer in Estonia?

[Reinsalu] On a case-by-case basis you could ask that about every individual, but the fact remains that the cabinet made the decision today, for sure based on human consideration, and the decision is that if focuses on the year and the point.

I think it's reasonable for people to take a yearly perspective. As the Minister of the Interior said, if there are objective circumstances whereby one individual is at risk of persecution, his or her case will be processed separately.

[ETV] Such cases could build up considerably if, for instance, students protest the war

[Reinsalu] There can be such cases, right, this has been appreciated. But the fact that they are simply a citizen of the Russian Federation is certainly not a basis for granting political asylum in isolation. The real danger we have right now, in my view, is that we have hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens moving around, and we are in danger of this overpopulation of Russian citizens travelling to and fro here which makes it actually so difficult for us to monitor the situation from a security point of view, and second, this is also morally, I think, very doubtful.

[ETV] Let's talk about the ditching of the [16+1] China cooperation format - why do that now?

[Reinsalu] For the simple reason that it makes sense, and that I discussed it with the Foreign Minister of Latvia before. Estonia and Latvia announced their decision today. We prefer EU cooperation. And there is certainly an element here in that China has not condemned the Russian Federation's war against Ukraine in clear terms.

[ETV] Let's talk briefly about the Narva tank as well. The mayor of Narva, Katri Raik, promises that the tank will be moved by August 20. Does this suffice?

[Reinsalu] The Secretary of State in his letter today made it clear that the government expects this tank to be moved within the next week. A government decision is in force to remove the tank and indeed any red monuments from the public space in Narva as soon as possible. Let's see what the decision of the Narva council will be on Monday. I really hope that it will not be one which leaves questions in the air. This clear line is, Narva is a city in the Republic of Estonia, and the Republic of Estonia shares our values, and based on these values, we shape our future.

The Baltic States: Estonia cancels its Schengen visas for Russians; The Seimas of Latvia recognizes Russia as a "state - sponsor of terrorism":

The MFA: The decision of the Seimas (Parliament) of Latvia to recognize Russia as a "state -sponsor of terrorism": "We are considering the statement of the Latvian Seimas on the "recognition" of the Russian Federation as a "state - sponsor of terrorism" with a call to stop issuing tourist visas to Russians as another manifestation of Russophobia, which has long become a "tuning fork" of Latvian foreign policy", the MFA statement says. According to the MFA, the decision of Riga is contrary to international law. MFA, RT, RIA, Rambler, RBC

• Social Media Commentary: Nezygar Brief Telegram channel (235.4K): "Moscow most likely will not respond to Latvia's propaganda demarche. Riga is counting on the Kremlin's reaction, but this is their erroneous tactic. Apart from the noise of propagandists and measures of an economic nature, there will be no other reaction. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will give a dry comment, politicians of the first echelon from the State Duma and the Federation Council will PR on the topic and close it. The Baltics will learn by what the pound is dashing in fall and winter, and there are enough surprises for energy-dependent and subsidized regions. You can, for example, publish a new agreement between Riga and Gazprom, where it opened and already partially paid for gas in rubles. The actions of Riga and Tallinn are largely caused by internal political problems. Against the backdrop of the crisis, the influence of moderate and pro-Russian parties is growing, which is alarming right-wing conservative forces. The task of Russian loyalty is recognized as the most important in Latvia and Estonia, where the largest Russian diaspora is. They are also the richest. In addition, in Riga and Tallinn they are afraid of local armed conflicts and the emergence of Russian proxy forces capable of destabilizing the situation. At the same time, some officials are concerned about the transformation of Latvia into the center of an ideological conflict with Russia; the situation will literally squeeze the pro-Russian opposition out of the country."

***

Regnum editor in chief Yuriy Baranchik (22.4K): "The Saeima of Latvia has declared Russia a country that "supports terrorism." This is another conceptual test for Russia's foreign policy. Let me remind you that one of these landmark tests was the voicing of the idea of strikes on decision-making centers, bridges and railways in Ukraine. It was not implemented... In theory, in response to this step of Latvia, we should break off diplomatic relations, close the Latvian embassy, declare Latvia a rogue state that is carrying out the genocide of the Russian population, declare a trade and economic blockade and take a set of "other measures" to admonish the Latvian political elite... The severity of our diplomatic response will show how seriously we are ready to defend our national interests."

***

Maester Telegram channel (206.5K): "Latvian Foreign Minister Edgar Rinkevich reacted nervously to the idea voiced in the State Duma to simplify the acquisition of Russian citizenship by residents of the Baltic states. "In this case, the newly minted citizens of Russia are not granted a residence permit, and they will have to leave Latvia, it will be necessary to introduce appropriate clarifications into the national legislation," he wrote. Neither the Russian nor the Latvian initiatives have yet taken a complete shape, so it is impossible to say about the exact consequences of these decisions. But if we add here today's decision of the Latvian Seimas to recognize Russia as a sponsor of terrorism, then it becomes clear that aggression against the Russian-speaking minority of the republic plans to reach a new level. Latvia, which sees a threat even in 200 Russian opposition journalists in the country, is seriously afraid of the passportization of the Russian-speaking community, probably seeing this as a pretext for Russia to interfere in the internal affairs of the state under the guise of protecting its citizens."

The MFA spokesperson Zakharova comments on the decision of the Latvian Parliament to declare Russia "a country-sponsor of terrorism": "The Saeima of Latvia has declared Russia a "country-sponsor of terrorism". [is that] News? No. We have already commented on it. Considering that there is no texture under this decision except for savage xenophobia, it is necessary to call [its] ideologues nothing more but "neo-Nazis", Maria Zakharova wrote in her Telegram channel. RBC, Rossiya First Channel, RIA

Estonia to close borders for Russians with Schengen visas issued in the republic: Tallinn has decided to close the country's borders for Russians with Schengen visas issued in Estonia. "This provides for a number of exceptions", Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia Urmas Reinsalu said. "In a week, a sanction will be applied to Schengen visas issued by the Republic of Estonia. The sanction means that the visas will remain valid. However, sanctions will be imposed on visa holders when entering Estonia, that is, they will be prohibited from entering Estonia", Minister Reinsalu said. There will be exceptions for persons who work in a diplomatic mission; persons whose work is related to international transportation; persons whose arrival is connected with humanitarian reasons; persons who visit a relative living in Estonia; persons entitled to free movement within the EU. Kommersant, RBC, Izvestia, Moskovskiy Komsomolets

• Social Media Commentary: RT editor in chief Margarita Simonyan (341.5K): "Estonia has closed entry to Russians, except for truck drivers, relatives of Estonians and diplomats. Wait, what, someone else went to Estonia besides them?"

***

Journalist Alexey Naumov (9.8K): "An interesting ideological split in the European Union was exposed by the Estonian decision to close the borders for Russians. The European Union, although it grew out of a purely economic association of coal and steel, today is a largely ideological organization - upholding the values of the free world as it sees them. The ideological lacquer gives the unification a touch of meaningfulness and holds it together. This is how it seems to the European giants - it was not without reason that Scholz said that he had little idea of the possibility of banning the issuance of visas to all Russians. For the new EU members, the union is largely not about values, but about political expediency. About increasing your own strength. About the opposition to Russia. For conservative Poland, with problems with freedom of speech and a de facto ban on abortion, no European values are needed - it needs to take revenge on Russia and at the same time Germany for centuries of humiliation. To do this, Berlin is regularly asked for compensation for the Nazis, and we are seeing opposition to Moscow live. The Baltic countries keep up with the comrades from Warsaw. Actually, the current value "split" between the old and new EU members won't lead to any immediate consequences - rather, it will make it more difficult to form a motley EU as an independent political force. And will once again prove that Europe is different. And Russia is its integral part."

***

Shulika Telegram channel (27.7K): "The Estonian authorities have made a decision, according to which Russian citizens who have a Schengen visa issued by the republic will be denied entry into the country. The sanctions will not apply to employees of Russian diplomatic missions in Estonia and members of their families, as well as persons involved in international transportation or who have the right to free movement under EU law. In addition, the restrictions will not apply to persons whose entry into the Republic is necessary for humanitarian reasons, close relatives of Estonian citizens and holders of a permanent residence permit in the Republic. Now 50,000 Estonian visas have been issued to Russians. The game, of course, is utter idiocy. Absolutely Soviet people, on the one hand. On the other hand, this is a pre-election technology, there will be elections soon. This is how the world lives - in Israel, the pre-election technology was in the form of a military operation in Gaza, and in Estonia in the form of a fight against the Russians."

***

Vremennoe Pravitelstvo Telegram channel (33.5K): "As we expected, the Baltics will not go further. Estonia announced the closure of the border for Russians with Schengen visas issued by it (with a number of exceptions), while Germany announced that it would continue to issue visas to Russians, because. responsibility for the SMO is not borne by ordinary citizens, but by the leadership of the Russian Federation."

Estonian PM says visa ban Kremlin's 'Achilles heel'

Text of report in English by ERR News website, operated by Estonian Public Broadcasting, on 12 August

The Russian elite's critical reaction to calls to ban Schengen visas for Russians shows it is an effective sanction tool, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas (Reform) said on Friday. It is also fair, as only three countries shoulder the burden.

Opinion is split within the European Union over a potential Russian Schengen visa ban. On Thursday [11 August], Estonia said it will implement its own ban on August 18.

While Estonia, Latvia and Finland are pushing for the rules to be rolled out across the EU, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he was against such a move yesterday. Today, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky came out in support.

"We will continue these negotiations. The foreign ministers have a meeting at the end of August and this topic is very much on the agenda. What must be understood is that only 10 percent of the Russian population travels abroad and it is these people, who are mainly from Moscow and St. Petersburg, whose opinion matters. This is also shown by Russia's very painful reactions to this proposal," Kallas told ERR.

Former Russian president and deputy chairman of its Security Council Dmitry Medvedev attacked Kallas over the move earlier this week after she wrote on social media that "visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right".

"It shows that this is the Achilles' heel. This is something that they are really afraid of, so it is effective," she said.

"And the fact that they once again attack me personally, that they pay so much attention to me, that Russia did not consider it necessary to pay [much attention to] any Estonian politician before, suggests that we must continue to fight for a just cause," Kallas said.

The prime minister has previously been verbally attacked by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova.

Finland, Estonia, Latvia carry visa burden

Estonia, Latvia and Finland carry the biggest burden of Russian tourists travelling to Europe, Kallas said, adding it is fair to stop issuing Schengen visas.

"Europe has banned air travel from Russia to Europe. This means that the only way Russian people can get to Europe is through three countries - Finland, Estonia and Latvia. So it's not quite fair that all the other Schengen countries give out these visas, but actually the three of us carry the burden," said Kallas.

She suggested Finland may also follow Estonia's decision in the future.

"If you look at the Finnish media and public opinion, then these discussions are going on in Finland. It is true that decision-making in Finland generally takes more time, but that's how democracy works, so, yes, these discussions are going on in Finland," said Kallas.

Copenhagen, Denmark: Estonia has decided to bar people with tourist visas from entering the northernmost Baltic country from neighbouring Russia as a consequence of the war in Ukraine.

Fellow-Baltic nation Latvia declared Russia a "state sponsor of terrorism" for attacks on civilians during the war in Ukraine and urged other countries to follow suit.

"Russian citizens' opportunity to visit Estonia in large numbers or to visit Europe through Estonia is incompatible with the meaning of the sanctions we've established," Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu was quoted as saying by the Baltic News Service.

The European Union, of which Estonia is a member, has banned air travel from Russia after it invaded Ukraine. But Russians can still travel by land to Estonia and apparently are then taking flights to other European destinations.

By imposing the sanction, Estonia wants Russia "to be unable to continue its ordinary international life also at the level of its citizens," Reinsalu said according to BNS, the region's main news agency. They had observed "a massive growth in the number of Russian citizens transiting through or arriving in Estonia".

BNS said exceptions to the sanction included Russian citizens with a long-term residence permit; those coming to visit close relatives; workers involved in the international transport of goods and passengers, as well as people entering the country for humanitarian reasons.

The Estonian sanction applies from August 18. Estonia and Russia share a nearly 300-kilometre border.

"I call on other governments to follow such steps," Reinsalu wrote on Twitter.

This week, Estonian and Finnish leaders urged fellow European countries to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens.

Latvia's parliament on Thursday also declared Russia a "state sponsor of terrorism" for attacks on civilians during the war in Ukraine and urged other countries to follow suit.

MPs adopted a strongly worded statement that accused Moscow of using "suffering and intimidation as tools in its attempts to demoralise the Ukrainian people and armed forces and paralyse the functioning of the state".

It declared it "recognises Russia's violence against civilians in pursuit of political aims as terrorism, recognises Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism and calls on other like-minded countries to express the same view".

Latvian president backs ban on issuance of tourist visas to Russians

RIGA. Aug 14 (Interfax/BNS) - Together with Finland, Estonia, the Czech Republic and other like-minded nations, Latvia should demand on the European level that the issuance of tourist visas to Russians be halted, Latvian President Egils Levits said.

Addressing the 23rd congress of victims of political repression in Latvia's Ikskile on Saturday, Levits stressed that this would add to anti-Russian sanctions.

Levits recalled that a discussion about Russian tourists in Europe recently started in Latvia and several other European countries, particularly in Estonia and Finland, which are also Russia's neighbors, and in the Czech Republic, which last month took over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the Latvian presidential chancellery told the news agency BNS on Sunday.

In this regard, it is necessary to review visas and residence permits previously issued by Latvia, Levits said. Residence permits issued to those people supporting Russia's actions in Ukraine should be cancelled or at least should not be extended, except under special circumstances, he said.

Residence permits should not be issued to permanent residents of Latvia who obtain Russian citizenship in the future, and such individuals should leave Latvia, he said.

"Trading in residence permits by previous governments, their unjustifiable generosity and issuing residence permits to Russian citizens, behind which were hidden only the vested interests of some businessmen in politics, created security risks and contributed to bilingualism. Now it's time to review the consequences of these failed and dangerous policies," Levits said.

Earlier this week, the Estonian government approved a new sanction restricting the issuance of visas to Russian nationals and barring Russian citizens who wish to visit Estonia for tourism, business, sportive or cultural purposes and have valid visas issued by Estonia on hand from entering the country.

"This means that if a Russian citizen with a Schengen visa issued by Estonia, whose purpose of the visit is tourism, business, sport or culture, arrives at a border checkpoint such as Narva, Luhamaa or Koidula, they can no longer enter Estonia starting next Thursday, August 18," the Estonian government's press service said on Friday.

Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin recently spoke in favor of restricting the issuance of tourist visas to Russians at the EU level. "It is clear that Russians use Finland as a transport hub when traveling via our country to holiday destinations in other countries. We're discussing this matter in the government, and the discussion will continue," Marin told Finland's Yle website.

Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said earlier a ban on issuing Schengen visas to Russian nationals could be introduced.

"A ban on the issuance of Schengen visas to Russian citizens could be another sanction," Polish radio quoted Lipavsky as saying on Thursday.

Former Russian president and deputy chairman of its Security Council Dmitry Medvedev attacked Kallas over the move earlier this week after she wrote on social media that "visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right".

"It shows that this is the Achilles' heel. This is something that they are really afraid of, so it is effective," she said.

"And the fact that they once again attack me personally, that they pay so much attention to me, that Russia did not consider it necessary to pay [much attention to] any Estonian politician before, suggests that we must continue to fight for a just cause," Kallas said.

The prime minister has previously been verbally attacked by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Maria Zakharova.

Estonia, Latvia and Finland carry the biggest burden of Russian tourists travelling to Europe, Kallas said, adding it is fair to stop issuing Schengen visas.

She suggested Finland may also follow Estonia's decision in the future.

Visas for Russian citizens, gas consumption and plans to double the size of Estonia's territorial defence were among the main topics discussed by Estonian media between 26 July and 1 August.

Sanctions

Residents of Russia are used to suffering and, based on various assessments, can weather Western sanctions for another six to nine months, energy expert Raivo Vare said. "It is believed that the people's suffering will not reach critical mass for another six to nine months as individuals and companies are still able to adjust," Vare said on a radio show. "But the situation is becoming gloomier and it is increasingly reflecting in what people have to eat," he added. Vare pointed out that it is no longer possible to get reliable information about the economic situation in Russia, which is why many assessments are based on manipulated data. "Therefore, we are proceeding from an inadequate database. But practical data out of Russia suggests things are deteriorating fast." That said, there are no grounds to believe Putin would end the war because of sanctions. "We have now learned that his plans are quite different, and I am sure he will try to continue the war as long as possible," Vare said. (ERR, in Estonian, 26 Jul 22)

No visas for Russians

Estonia has reduced the possibilities to apply for residence permits and study visas for Russians and Belarusians, the government said on 28 July. Russian citizens can no longer apply for a temporary residence permit or visa for the purpose of studying in Estonia. Belarusians can still apply for study visas. Additionally, citizens of Russia and Belarus who are working in the country but have no legal right to stay in Estonia, for example while on a visa issued by another EU member state, will not be granted a temporary residence permit or allowed to work either, Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu said. The minister added that Estonia has stopped issuing visas to Russian citizens living in Estonia, except in specific humanitarian cases. There are currently more than 50,000 valid visas issued to Russian citizens, he noted. "We are preparing additional European Union sanction proposals concerning the issuance of future Schengen visas, but it is also necessary to revise the validity of previously issued visas. Both in Estonia and in Europe," Reinsalu said. Estonia stopped issuing visas to Russian citizens in February but those who had previously received a visa could still enter the country. Estonia cannot prevent Russians with a valid Schengen visa issued by another member state from entering the EU. (ERR, in Estonian, 28 Jul 22)

Urmas Reinsalu said that Estonia will propose restricting Russian citizens' access to Europe as a main rule. He also said Estonia should emulate Latvia in requiring Russian citizens who wish to enter Estonia to sign a declaration condemning Putin's war in Ukraine, which principle should also apply to citizenship through naturalisation. "Life reveals loopholes. Russian citizens can still access Estonia even after we stopped issuing visas. They simply get another country's Schengen visa. That loophole needed to be closed," Reinsalu said on a radio show. Reinsalu added that the simplest "remedy" would be pan-European restrictions. "This would require cutting off Russian citizens' access to Europe as a main rule, which is what Estonia will propose," he said. "I will be meeting with EU foreign ministers in Prague later in August where I will introduce the pan-European restrictions plan," the minister promised. Reinsalu added that the number of people looking to leave Russia has grown considerably since the start of the war. "Latvia has a principle that we could emulate. Russian citizens, upon entering the country, have to sign a document declaring to condemn Putin's war in Ukraine. The principle could also be used in naturalisation," the minister said. (ERR, in Estonian, 29 Jul 22)

Gas

Estonia is seeking an emergency exception within the EU's gas reduction solidarity measure if Russia disconnects the Baltic states from the electricity grid, Economic Affairs and Infrastructure Minister Riina Sikkut said. The EU wants all member states to lower their gas usage by 15 per cent to reduce reliance on Russian gas. Estonia's gas consumption has decreased by 16 per cent this year compared to the five-year average and it is predicted it will fall further over the year. However, the government is seeking an exception in case emergency stations need to be activated. "If it were to happen that Russia disconnects us from its electricity grid, in order to keep the frequency here in the Baltic region, emergency stations that run on gas must be started up in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. And then, without a doubt, we would not be able to fulfill the 15 per cent mandatory reduction criteria," Sikkut said. "Estonia's position is that we support the setting of such a goal at the European Union level, but understandably exceptions are also needed and Estonia has also requested an exception," she said. (ERR, in Estonian, 25 Jul 22)

Defence

Three ships from Standing Nato Maritime Group 1 are currently stationed in Tallinn and the fleet has been practicing cooperation, deterrence and preparedness with the Baltic countries since the start of 2022 to deter Russian aggression. The fleet is led by Dutch commodore Jeanette Morang who said the ships are practicing in the event the security situation worsens. "We are also here to potentially deter Russian Federation units if they have bad intentions. So for us, it is to be ready, to train here, to be interoperable with units in the region, and within the task group," Morang said. The maritime unit is also practicing interoperability with other areas of the armed forces, such as the Nato Air Policing Unit and the Enhanced Forward Presence battlegroup. (ERR, in Estonian, 26 Jul 22)

Doubling the size of Estonia's territorial defence structure to 20,000 people is necessary to strengthen Estonia's defence, Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said. Pevkur, who stepped into the role two weeks ago, visited the headquarters of the Estonian Defence League and met the commander of the Defence League to receive an overview. "I am convinced that doubling the size of the territorial defence structure, i.e. to 20,000 people, is the right move and necessary in order to strengthen Estonia's national defence. The role of territorial defence within our defence structure is crucial, increasing the readiness and ability of the reserve army as a whole to resist the enemy," Pevkur said after his meeting with the commander.

TALLINN, Aug 16, BNS – According to the Estonian Ministry of Culture, when the relevant sanction comes into effect, the Russian band Shortparis will not be able to enter Estonia to perform here even if their visas have been issued earlier.

"Participation in a cultural event is subject to the sanction, which means that you cannot enter the country for this purpose, even if the visa was issued earlier," Tarvi Sits, the secretary general of the Ministry of Culture, said in his response to a query from the Tartu city government.

"Due to the military aggression in Ukraine, cultural cooperation with Russia has been discontinued. We hope for the war to end soon and for it to be possible for cultural cooperation to continue in the future," he added.

The topic of entering Estonia with a visa issued earlier arose for the Tartu city government because the organizer has scheduled a performance by the band Shortparis in Tartu for the beginning of September.

"The same band was supposed to perform in Tallinn before and, according to the organizer, they are opponents of the Russian regime, which is also expressed in their music," the culture department of the Tartu city government said in its letter to the ministry.

The Estonian government last week approved a sanction that will come into effect on Aug. 18, which restricts both the issuance of visas to citizens of the Russian Federation and the entry into the country from the external border with Schengen visas issued by Estonia.

Estonian minister: Procurement contracts with Russian cos must be terminated by Oct. 10

TALLINN, Aug 16, BNS - Amendments to the Public Procurement Act entered into force in Estonia this week that facilitate the implementation of the European Union's sanctions against Russian entrepreneurs, Minister of Public Administration Riina Solman said, adding that procurement contracts with Russian entrepreneurs must be terminated by Oct. 10.

"Enterprises affiliated with Russia cannot take part in our public procurements. Now, if there is even the slightest doubt, our contracting authorities will be able to request additional evidence to rule it out definitively," the minister said in a press release.

It is forbidden to conclude a procurement contract or to continue the execution of an already concluded procurement contract with a Russian citizen, resident, enterprise, agency or other entity. They also cannot be subcontractors or suppliers in the fulfillment of a procurement contract. It is also prohibited to conclude or continue a procurement contract if the entrepreneur is not subject to the sanction and is not related to the subjects of the sanction, but supplies goods that have been subjected to an international sanction.

In order to rule out mistakes, the contracting authority has the right to demand any confirmations, data and proof from participants in public procurements to check that there are no international sanctions involved.

"We understand that terminating procurement contracts immediately may put contracting authorities in a difficult situation, which is why a transition period has been put in place," Solman said. "Thus, if an ongoing procurement contract that violates sanctions was signed before April 9 and remains valid until Oct. 10 this year, the fulfillment thereof may continue. Contracts with a deadline later than Oct. 10 must be terminated on this date at the latest," she said.

The European Union on April 8 passed a regulation concerning restricting measures in relation to Russia's hostilities in Ukraine. With the regulation, sanctions were established also in relation to public procurement contracts.

During the period from 2015 through 2021, contracting authorities from Estonia have signed 44 contracts with Russian enterprises.

Estonian Customs Board: Suspected violations of timber import ban not confirmed

TALLINN, Aug 16, BNS - The Estonian Forest and Wood Industries Association turned to public authorities on Monday with suspicions of plywood manufactured in Russia being imported to Kazakhstan, Georgia and Azerbaijan and subsequently exported to the European Union as local goods, however, Kulli Kurvits, head of customs formalities at the Tax and Customs Board, said that the association's suspicions have not be found to be warranted.

"Based on the databases of the Tax and Customs Board, the suspicions by the association have not been found to be warranted as there have not been any timber imports from the said states to Estonia after July 10," Kurvits told BNS, adding that the authority checks that sanctions be followed and if a violation of a sanction has been detected, the Tax and Customs Board initiates an investigation which may culminate in criminal proceedings.

"There would be reason to suspect a violation of the sanctions if timber was exported from the said states and if it was actually coming from the Russian Federation," she said, adding that EU member states' customs agencies are able to check the origin of goods as well as possible violations of sanctions through cooperation with the customs agencies of the countries from which the goods arrive.

"These are routine activities. We're also working in close cooperation with other member states' customs and supervisory authorities," Kurvits said.

From midnight on July 10, a transition period ended for wood transported from the Russian Federation to the European Union, and from July 11, the sanctions imposed by the European Commission on wood imports were fully applied.

The Estonian Forest and Wood Industries Association turned to the Ministry of the Environment, Environmental Board and Tax and Customs Board on Monday requesting greater attention to a surge in the import of timber from Azerbaijan, Georgia and Kazakhstan to Estonia and to check if it includes sanctioned products of Russian origin or if the production of the items has included wood of Russian origin. 

According to the information available to experts in the sector, the said countries do not have the production volumes to match the statistics on import growth, nor does birch grow in these states, however, according to the association, birch plywood imports have grown in particular from Kazakhstan, Georgia and Azerbaijan.

Estonian visa cancellation has ordinary Russians worried

TALLINN (Reuters) - Estonia this week will close its border to more than 50,000 Russians with previously issued visas, the first country in the European Union to do so, making it harder for ordinary Russians to enter EU.

Like many of the hundreds of Russians crossing the border each day at the Estonian town Narva, Anna is worried she will not be able to keep coming to Estonia, where she visits the graves of relatives.

"We hope that countries will come up with some solution. Maybe they can agree on something. I keep myself away from politics but since my relatives are buried here I would like to keep coming," she said.

"But what can you do. For us, regular people we can't solve this. This has to be negotiated and I hope our countries at some point will reach agreement and find compromise".

The ban comes just four days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy issued a fresh call for EU states to ban visas for Russian nationals to keep the bloc from becoming a "supermarket" open to anyone with the means to enter.

Zelenskiy said his proposal did not apply to Russians who needed help for risking their freedom or their lives by resisting Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin's policies.

With European airspace shut to Russians, many have been traveling through bordering Baltic countries and Finland in order to fly to other parts of Europe on Schengen visas. The visas allow 90 days of travel within the 26-country, border-free Schengen Area.

"We will sanction all the Schengen visas which are valid currently except some humanitarian and family related cases," Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu told Reuters, adding that the government was considering closing the Estonian-Russian border completely to all Russians.

An Estonian government spokesperson said Estonia was the first EU country to ban travel on previously issued visas. Some 2,500 Russians enter Estonia each day, around half of them on Schengen visas.

In addition, around 9% Estonian residents are foreign citizens, most of them Russians.

Reinsalu said it was not a human right to enter Europe and that Russian taxpayers visiting Europe were also funding Russia's war in Ukraine.

"We have to admit that Russian society, by and large, also bears passive moral responsibility for these atrocities, which takes place on Ukrainian soil," he said

"The legal responsibility is on Putin, his inner circle, and these executioners of genocide. But of course, the moral responsibility lies also on this state and its citizens," Reinsalu added.

Finland will slash the number of visas issued to Russians to 10% of the current amount from Sept. 1, Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said on Tuesday, amid a rush of Russian tourists bound for Europe.

Haavisto said the decision had come as an influx of Russian tourists began using Finland and its Helsinki-Vantaa Airport as a gateway towards European holiday destinations, after Russia lifted pandemic-related border restrictions a month ago.

Some EU leaders such as Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin and her Estonian counterpart, Kaja Kallas, have called for an EU-wide visa ban, which German Chancellor Olaf Scholz opposed on Monday, saying Russians should be able to flee their home country if they disagree with the regime.

"All the decisions we take should not make it more complicated to leave the country, for getting away from the leadership and the dictatorship in Russia," Scholz said this week.

Estonian expert calls for EU-wide entry ban for Russian citizens

Even though most EU member states have not responded enthusiastically to Estonia's call for an EU-wide entry ban for Russian citizens, such a decision by the European Union cannot be ruled out, a political scientist has written. The following is the text of an opinion piece by political scientist Keit Kasemets entitled "Keit Kasemets: Travel of Russian citizens to the European Union must be restricted" and published by the ERR News website operated by Estonian Public Broadcasting, on 15 August:

Europe will never be able to identify one-by-one the relatives, children and mistresses of all Russian politicians, top officials and top brass and then impose entry bans on them. Hence a wider entry ban is inevitable, Keit Kasemets writes.

According to Frontex, 856 000 Russian citizens have entered the European Union since the beginning of the war [in Ukraine]. Most have done so by crossing the Russia-EU border, but they are also travelling to Europe via Belarus. In addition to the eastern border, Russian citizens can travel to the European Union via Turkey, Serbia and a few other states by plane.

The number of Russian citizens travelling to Europe has grown throughout the summer. In early August, over 70 000 Russian citizens entered by crossing the land border. They mostly arrive via Finland (268,500 people) and Estonia (249,600 people).

Those arriving in the European Union include Russian citizens with permanent residence permits here and people with dual citizenship, but most are travellers to Europe with long-term or short-term visas. They arrive in Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland by car, bus and train, and continue travelling to European resorts.

Morally this is not right and restrictions on Russian citizens' entry to the European Union is certainly a step that would have the effect of sanctions, judging by the reactions of Russian politicians.

Given the competence of the European Union, it is not easy to make a Europe-wide decision to ban Russian citizens from the EU, but nor is it completely impossible. In making the decision, one should take into account the principles of the Schengen area.

When establishing the Schengen area, states wanted to participate in the benefits of free movement in the European Union, but nobody wanted to give up decision-making competence. Hence European states themselves decide whether and to whom they issue Schengen visas, but one can move with them all over the Schengen free movement area.

The states on Schengen's external border must let in arrivals with EU visas. So, Estonia might end issuing visas to Russian citizens and ban entry for those with visas issued by Estonia, but we must still let in people with visas issued by Germany, for example.

States may temporarily, for example for security or public health considerations, close their borders to citizens of third states and, like we saw during the corona pandemic, also to citizens of other EU states. But this is a decision for states to make, not the EU. Restricting entry to the entire European Union presupposes a unanimous principled decision by the heads of state of the European Union, which each state will implement independently and the enforcement of which will be monitored by the European Commission.

Effectively there are two options.

Firstly, ending the issuance of visas to Russian citizens. This would restrict the entry of Russian citizens to the European Union, but the impact would be long term because many Russian citizens have long-term Schengen visas. This decision would require a political agreement that each state would implement.

The second option is to ban the entry of visa-holders for security considerations. This, too, is formally the decision of each state. This is also how the system worked during the corona time when the European Commission proposed a list of third states from which it is safe to arrive in Europe. States agreed to this list and began to jointly implement it.

Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Czech Republic have stopped issuing visas to Russian citizens. Estonia has decided to ban entry with visas issued by Estonia. This limits the growth in the number of Russian citizens arriving in Europe, but still allows hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens to travel in the European Union because other states continue to issue visas and do not ban entry in their states. A Europe-wide entry ban would have the effect of a sanction, which in addition to Estonia also Finland, Latvia and Czech Republic also wish to impose.

So far, our appeal has not been met with positive responses from other European states. Some counter-arguments are based on the wider Central European principles of personal freedom and free movement, while others are more concrete. None of them is truly relevant, now that Russia has invaded Ukraine, because the situation now is completely different.

One of the main counter-arguments is that an entire people or population of a state cannot be punished for the crimes of one group. It has been said that a total ban would make sanctions and entry bans imposed on concrete individuals meaningless.

On the one hand, this is indeed so, but the current situation also shows that Europe will never be able to identify the relatives, children and mistresses of all Russian politicians, top officials and top brass, and then to add them to the entry ban list. Hence, a wider entry ban is inevitable.

It has been recalled in European discussions that the EU harshly criticised the decision of US President Donald Trump to ban the entry of Iranians, Syrians and Libyans into the state. These decisions are not comparable, of course. In Trump's case, this was mostly related to people fleeing war, not to citizens of a state that had started a war against another state.

Also, the wider logic of not punishing all citizens does not apply to Russia. Russia is the first state that has publicly gone to war against a European state since the end of World War Two. According to polls, the majority of Russian citizens support Vladimir Putin's war.

More concrete counter-arguments are related to the fear that an entry ban would lead to separations of families and would also make entry to Europe impossible for Russian dissidents. This is rather a pretext because there are different types of visas, and groups to whom an entry ban would apply can be defined precisely.

Czech Republic, the current EU presiding state, has promised that an entry ban will be discussed at the unofficial meeting of foreign ministers on 31 August. Based on the discussions being held in Europe, restricting entry to the EU for Russian citizens is not impossible, but this decision must be carefully targeted.

It is realistic and also necessary to restrict the entry of Russian tourists to Europe. Decisions by individual states to stop issuing visas and ban entry are not as effective as Europe-wide decisions, but it is in Estonia's interests to try to persuade as many states as possible. The more states that implement an entry ban by the end of August, the greater the likelihood of a joint decision by all states.

New restrictions on entering Estonia take effect for Russian citizens

TALLINN, Aug 18, BNS - From Thursday, restrictions enter into effect regarding the issuing of Estonian visas to Russian nationals and entry into the country will not be permitted for Russian citizens to whom Estonia has issued a visa and whose purpose for coming to Estonia is tourism, business, sport or culture. 

Minister of the Interior Lauri Laanemets said that the sanction is necessary because with its aggression against Ukraine, Russia is also attacking European values and freedoms.

"Thus, Russian citizens cannot have the self-evident freedom to enjoy the opportunities offered by these same European values and freedoms that are provided by the European Union, be it a holiday, education or business," Laanemets said. 

The minister added that of the visas issued to Russian citizens, some 53,000 have been granted for the purpose of tourism and business.

"On average, some 2,500 Russian citizens enter Estonia per day, of whom nearly 1,250 come with a short-term visa, of which in turn around half have been issued by Estonia while the rest have been issued by other Schengen states. Thus, this measure has a certain limited effect but in order to achieve a real sanction impact, visa restrictions should be implemented by all EU member states," Laanemets said. 

The minister of the interior underscored that the opportunity to apply for an Estonian visa is available to those citizens of Russia who come to Estonia to visit a close relative who is a citizen of Estonia or lives here based on a long-term residence permit. Applying for a visa is also permitted for Russian diplomats working in Estonia and their family members, workers in the field of international goods and passenger transport, people who have the right of movement based on EU law and individuals to whom Estonia deems it warranted to issue a visa on humanitarian grounds. 

"I know that entrepreneurs have questions in the light of the sanction entering into force today about their top specialists working in Estonia. Thus, I want to reiterate that these changes do not concern those citizens of Russia to whom a short-term registration of their employment in Estonia and an Estonian visa have been issued previously. They will be able to work here until the expiration of said permits. Such valid residence permits that have been issued for work are being held today by some 1,659 citizens of the Russian Federation," he said.

The government's decision to ban Russians with Estonian-issued Schengen visas from entering the country and defence cooperation with Finland were among the main topics discussed by Estonian media on 9-15 August.

Visa ban

Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin told the country's public broadcaster Yle that the EU should expand sanctions to limit travel for Russian citizens. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas followed up by calling for Schengen area countries to stop issuing them tourist visas. "It is not right that at the same time as Russia is waging an aggressive, brutal war of aggression in Europe, Russians can live a normal life, travel in Europe, be tourists," Marin said. She added that it was essential to determine whether legislation must be amended to allow Finland to decide its own national sanctions in exceptional situations. Kallas tweeted a call to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens altogether: "Stop issuing tourist visas to Russians." (ERR, in Estonian, 9 Aug 22)

Estonia will ban Russians with Estonian-issued Schengen visas from entering the country, the government announced on 11 August. The rule does not affect permanent residents and will enter into effect on 18 August. "This sanction means that the visas will remain valid, but the visa holders will be sanctioned when entering Estonia, they will not be allowed to enter Estonia," Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu said at the government's weekly news conference. The decision does not concern Russian citizens with visas issued by other EU members. But this issue will be raised with the EU later this month, he said. It will also not affect Russian citizens whose homeland is Estonia or who are permanent residents of Estonia, Reinsalu said. The government is now pushing for all EU member states to adopt the rule. (ERR, in Estonian, 11 Aug 22)

The Estonian government has decided to give Russian students studying in Estonia a one year visa extension to complete their studies beyond the nominal period. Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu said that as visas or residence permits are issued for the purpose of completing a degree course within a nominal period, students who require extra time to complete their studies will be granted an extension of one year. "The Ministry of the Interior estimates that the number of students who would need this in the next year is 50," Reinsalu said. Interior Minister Lauri Laanemets added that the sanctions imposed on Russia in the spring had led to an unexpected situation for those Russian students in Estonia who had not been able to complete their studies in the nominal period. "For many of these young people, returning home in the current situation could be dangerous because they have spoken out in defence of Ukraine and criticised Russia's aggression and its regime," said Laanemets. "This is a criminal offence in Russia, and it was therefore deemed necessary to extend the residence permits of these students for one year in order to allow them to complete their studies here," the interior minister added. (ERR, in Estonian, 11 Aug 22)

Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu said ordinary Russian citizens could not be treated as a separate category from that country's leader, Vladimir Putin, the aggressor in the current conflict in Ukraine. Reinsalu was referring to a ban on entry of Russian citizens holding Estonia-issued Schengen visas. The minister made his remarks in an interview with a news show on the ETV channel. "I am not in agreement with an approach whereby we look at "ordinary" Russian citizens and distinguish them from Putin. The war is being prosecuted by the Russian Federation as a state. Without a doubt, Russian citizens, by their passivity, bear moral responsibility for this," Reinsalu said. "This means that Estonia's message is that Europe must impose sanctions, and our message, as the Estonian state, insofar as it is within our competence to impose these sanctions, is that Russian citizens are not welcome with us," he added. (ERR, in Estonian, 11 Aug 22)

MEP Yana Toom called the government's decision to bar entry to Russian citizens holding Estonia-issued Schengen Area visas "absurd". "This is an absurd situation. Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu proposes to ban Russians holding a Schengen visa issued by an Estonian embassy from entering Estonia, while Prime Minister Kaja Kallas supports him, as does Interior Minister Lauri Laanemets," Toom said. "Simultaneously, all other Schengen Area states have to admit Russian citizens with Estonia-issued visas. We cannot make decisions for the entire Schengen Area, but fortunately only for ourselves," she went on. "All we can do is deny entry to the visa holders that were issued just yesterday. I think we might look a little weak-minded in all this," Toom continued. "But that is the intention now," she added. Toom also said she did not think the measure would achieve its proposed goal. "I do not think this idea cannot meet with success, since sanctions have a legislative definition. The purpose is to preserve or restore peace, to preserve democracy. I cannot imagine, in my little head, how a ban on the entry of Russians can restore peace in Ukraine. I cannot get my head round this," she said. (ERR, in Estonian, 12 Aug 22)

Defence

Estonia and Finland's defence plans must be integrated, Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said at a meeting with his Finnish counterpart on 10 August. Pevkur met Antti Kaikkos in Helsinki to discuss regional security, bilateral defence cooperation, assistance to Ukraine and Finland's accession to Nato. They also discussed capacity development and Pevkur highlighted cooperation among the Baltic states, including the joint development of multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS). Pevkur said he was happy to see Finland and Sweden join Nato as it will increase the security and stability of the entire Euro-Atlantic region. "Finland's accession changes the potential battle space of the Baltic Sea region and we must treat it as a whole in the defence plans of the region, i.e. as a logical continuation, the defense plans of Estonia and Finland must be integrated," he added.

Russian visa ban a matter of national security and EU credibility, says Estonia’s PM]]

To protect national security and the integrity of EU sanctions, the bloc must impose a travel ban on tourism on Russian citizens until Moscow ends its invasion of Ukraine, Estonia’s Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told EURACTIV.

Since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there has been growing momentum from states such as Lithuania, Poland, Finland, and of course, Estonia to ban Russian citizens from entering their countries as tourists.

“I am advocating for the EU-wide travel ban on tourism to Russian citizens until the end of Russian aggression,” Kallas said.

“First and foremost, it is a question of EU’s credibility and moral clarity at times while massive war crimes, possibly a genocide is taking place next door to the EU,” Kallas added.

She said that measures taken by individual member states could not be as effective as an EU-wide ban, warning that “if we fail in consensus, individual member states will have to take measures on their own”.

Her comments come after several EU member states have unilaterally suspended issuing visas to most Russians, while Finland and Estonia recently called for the EU to do so jointly.

“Stopping such inflow is not only a question of morality but also a question of public and national security” and “a matter of implementing EU sanctions,” said Kallas.

“Such a situation is a circumvention of air travel sanctions the EU agreed upon earlier in spring – and we need to close this loophole now,” she added.

False pretexts

With European airspace shut to Russians, many have been travelling via the land borders of the Baltic countries, Poland and Finland to proceed to other parts of Europe on Schengen visas.

“Behind Estonia’s decisions to ban entry with Estonian-issued Schengen tourist visas is that we are witnessing a significantly increasing number of Russian citizens coming over our border”, Kallas said, adding that some of those are entering the EU’s Schengen area “under false pretexts”.

“For example, recently two Russian journalists claiming to be tourists came to Estonia to do hostile propaganda stories – they had Schengen tourism visas issued by other EU countries,” she said.

“This might feel like a distant problem to some, but it is not for Estonia – we carry the primary burden as a direct neighbour to Russia,” Kallas said, adding that about 30% of Russian tourists enter Schengen via Estonian land borders.

While Estonia’s ban applies only to visas issued by the country itself, Tallinn is seeking to block entry to Russians issued tourist Schengen visas by other EU countries.

Europeans split

Asked by EURACTIV whether the proposed ban should be a stand-alone measure or come as part of the eighth sanction package, Kallas argued in favour of the former but added, “the most important thing is achieving the goal, and it is a technical matter how to get there”.

EU foreign ministers are set to discuss the prospect of an EU-wide visa ban for Russian nationals when they meet informally in Prague next week, though EU diplomats stress a unified approach could be hard to achieve.

Greece and Cyprus have already spoken out against it for economic reasons, while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz opposed such a ban earlier this week, saying Russians should be able to flee their home country if they disagree with Kremlin policy.

The EU’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell earlier this week, also ruled out a complete ban on Russian travellers into the EU, adding the bloc should be “more selective” in its measures since “there are many Russians who want to flee their country because they don’t want to live in this situation”.

He also recalled that Russian oligarchs were already banned from entering EU territory as part of the bloc’s previous sanctions packages.

Some 1,214 Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, have been declared persona non grata and are currently barred from entering the bloc.

Kallas said an EU ban should include “humanitarian exceptions” and case-by-case reviews, citing her country’s application under which Russian citizens “can visit their family members, close relatives, our border is open for asylum seekers, dissidents of the regime to flee the country”.

“Some claim we must not punish ‘ordinary Russian citizens’ (…), but in this context, it is important to stress that travelling abroad is a special right and privilege in Russia,” Kallas said, adding that only 30% of Russian citizens hold a travel passport, primarily those living in Western parts of the country.

“The Kremlin knows that if people from metropolises are no longer able to travel freely to the EU for pleasure and holidays, this could cause a strong and negative reaction among them,” the Estonian prime minister said.

Russia’s foreign ministry has called the steps to ban Russians from travelling to the EU “politically-motivated discrimination” and “an expression of xenophobia and neo-Nazism”, warning such actions would  “not go without a proper response.”

A step in the right direction

According to Kallas, the Russian leadership’s strong outrage and personal attacks, also against her suggest that a ban would be “a step in the right direction”.

“This is not only a question of national security and of closing the EU sanction loophole, but also a clear matter of moral clarity,” Estonia’s prime minister said, citing examples where Ukrainian who have fled the war would “face Russian tourists all over Europe”.

“Our message is clear – tourism is a privilege, not a right, and this privilege does not belong to the citizens of a country that is conducting a genocidal war against Ukraine,” she added.

In February, the EU partially suspended its visa-facilitation agreement with Russia, mainly targeting government officials, diplomats, and business people.

The Czech Republic, which currently chairs the bloc’s rotating EU presidency, has called for the suspension of the EU’s visa facilitation agreements with Russia and Belarus, which simplified the procedure for issuing visas.

“It goes without saying that there cannot be any visa facilitation agreement with Russia and Belarus given the current circumstances,” Kallas said when asked whether this could be a compromise if there is no EU unity on the proposed tourism ban. [Edited by Benjamin Fox]

Estonian Prime Minister: "Russian citizens must pay a price for the war in Ukraine".

The Prime Minister of Estonia, the liberal Kaja Kallas (Tallinn, 45) of the Reform Party (Reformierakond, center-right), believes that an essential step to end the war in Ukraine is for Russian citizens to pay a price for it. And part of that price should be not being able to travel as tourists to the European Union, something Kallas defines as "a privilege and not a human right." The first woman to become head of the Estonian government, in January 2021, and who was revalidated in July after obtaining the endorsement of the Parliament to form a new coalition, part of the international press has dubbed her "the new iron lady of Europe". This lawyer embodies the hardest line towards Moscow in the EU and NATO. She rules out any concessions to the Kremlin, only believes in dialogue if Russia withdraws completely from Ukraine and advocates passing the toughest possible sanctions against Moscow.

In Tallinn, from where she spoke by videoconference with EL PAÍS this Friday, she assures to be "delighted" that Estonia "keeps Russia on its toes".

Question: Why does Estonia support the elimination of visas for Russian tourists?

Answer: For three main reasons. The first is that we already have [in the EU] a sanction that vetoes air travel between Europe and Russia, so Russian tourists come through the three countries with which they have land borders - Finland, Estonia and Latvia. If we advocate no travel between Europe and Russia, we should close that loophole. Also, we cannot check who these people are or whether they pose a security threat. The second reason is that we have to maintain moral consistency; that is, every citizen is responsible for the actions of his or her country. If Russia is waging war against an independent European country, then its citizens are also responsible for that. It is wrong for Russians to be enjoying their vacations while their country is waging war. And the third reason is, of course, that we are not advocating a total ban. There are exceptions for humanitarian access, family visits, and for dissidents and asylum seekers. And the fourth point is that we all want this war to end. We want inflation to stop. We want energy prices to stop rising. We want the migration crisis to stop. It's all related to the war. So we have to use the most effective tools to make it end.

More informationFollow live the last hour of the war in UkraineP. And the veto on Russian tourists is it?

A. From the Russian reaction, we see that this [the visa ban] is something that really hurts them because only 30% of Russian citizens have passports, which means that it is mainly residents of St. Petersburg and Moscow who travel to Europe. They also have the most influence in the Kremlin. If they are not satisfied, they could put pressure on their friends [in the government] to stop this war. Traveling to Europe is not a human right, it is a privilege and it is fair to withdraw that privilege if your country is fighting a war. If there are more than 70% of Russians who clearly support the war, they should also be held responsible for what is happening.

Q. Do you think a peace dialogue is possible?

A. No. Dialogue can only be to push Russia back to its borders. What is at stake is the rule of law at the international level, because if there are benefits from aggression against another state, it could be an invitation for further aggression elsewhere. The only thing to say [to Russia] is "You can't win this war. Stop this." When Russia stops fighting, the war will end. If Ukraine gives up the fight, the country will disappear. That's what the Ukrainian prime minister [Denys Shmyhal] has said, and I understand it perfectly because that's also the history of my country. I believe that if you push Ukraine into some kind of peace negotiations with the argument that it must give up some of its territory - a territory [occupied by Russia] that now covers three times the size of Switzerland - it will send the message that when you attack another state, you get benefits. We want to stop the energy crisis, inflation and migration coming out of Ukraine, and this will only happen when the war stops and there is no risk of Russia doing again what it has done or going a step further. We must support Ukraine as much as we can, with military and humanitarian aid and helping Ukrainian refugees, as well as sending a clear signal to Russia by way of applying strong sanctions and reinforcing its isolation politically and internationally.

Q. Could that further step be an aggression against another neighboring country like Estonia?

A. No country can feel safe as long as this war continues. Now we are talking about Russia's neighboring states, but all the dictators and autocrats in the world are carefully watching whether Russia gets away with this aggression to see if what Moscow has done is profitable because it will not be punished. That is why it is very important that we prosecute the war crimes that have been committed on the territory of Ukraine and also that the crime of aggression against another state be punished; that you cannot attack another independent country, torture its people and go unpunished.

Q. Did NATO's commitment in Madrid to increase its troops in the Baltic countries meet your expectations?

A. For us it is very important to move from deterrence to defense, which means being able to repel aggression from day one. What we got at the Madrid summit is a headquarters with division-sized troops [about 9,000 troops] in Estonia and other troops in allied countries with which we can work together. I think this is a very important step because, although we don't see that Russia has any plans to invade our territory, we must strengthen our defense so that they don't even think about it. We are a NATO country. We have Article Five, which says that to attack one is to attack all, and that deters Russia from taking that big step further.

Q. Moscow accuses Estonia of harboring the murderers of Daria Dugina, daughter of a Kremlin ideologue.

A. It's a Russian disinformation operation. Their story [that an alleged Ukrainian citizen killed Dugina by planting a bomb in her car before escaping through Estonia] is not very credible. There is also an information, cyber and hybrid attack war from Russia, especially towards the countries that help Ukraine the most. We are happy to make [Moscow] stay alert.

EU meets to nut out ban on Russia visas

The EU will look to restrict tourist visas to Russians at a meeting in Prague on Tuesday.

Under pressure from the Baltic States and Ukraine, which have long demanded a blanket visa ban, the EU is to look at making it more difficult for Russians to move about the continent, as well as farther afield.

For example, once Russians are in Europe, they can apply for an Australian tourist visa.

The Schengen visa concept, allowing free travel through all member countries once one has issued a visa, has complicated single-country responses.

Last week German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, mindful of the reliance of his country on Russian gas to get through the coming winter, said he didn’t want to punish ordinary Russians with such a tourism sanction.

“This is Putin’s war, so I have a very hard time accepting that idea,” Mr Scholz said.

It is anticipated that meeting of EU foreign ministers will scrap the preferential treatment Russians enjoy in applying for visas in member states.

But the Baltic states have threatened to go it alone and ban Russian tourist visas, making it more difficult for Russians to move through the rest of Europe, if the EU doesn’t agree to impose a Schengen-wide policy.

“They must be deprived of the right to cross international borders until they learn to respect them,” Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said this month.

Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said it wasn’t right for Russians to travel as tourists across the continent while their nation was waging war in Europe.

Denmark’s Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod told the Danish news agency: “I consider it shameful that Russian tourists can sunbathe and live in luxury in the south of Europe while Ukrainian cities are bombed beyond recognition.”

Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said visiting Europe should be a privilege for Russians. She noted that while air travel from Russia was shut, Schengen countries had continued to issue tourist visas and Russians were flooding into neighbouring countries through land borders. The timing of the visa tightening is curious given that Russians have flocked to the Mediterranean for the summer holidays, which have just finished.

Lithuanian Foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said Russians had been travelling through Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland and Poland to get to other parts of Europe. Some were flying via Istanbul, Dubai and Yerevan.

Latvia has already suspended tourist visas for Russians and Finland has cut the number of visas it approves by 90 per cent. In Britain, processing times for Russians applying for visas are so long and cumbersome to render an application virtually meaningless.

Estonia insists on the early adoption by the European Union of a new, already the eighth package of anti-Russian sanctions. This was reported by Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu to the German newspaper Welt. He added that Tallinn has already submitted to the European Commission its theses on the next sanction restrictions.

According to the Estonian "recipe", further tightening of restrictions against Russia should affect energy, trade, and the SWIFT banking system. Tallinn also proposes to introduce new bans for "undesirable" Russians and organizations.

Estonian ForMin: Use of oil import exemption up to companies themselves

TALLINN, Aug 31, BNS – Commenting on the list of companies with import exemptions for Russian oil products published on Tuesday, deputy secretary general of the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for legal and consular affairs Erki Kodar said that the listed companies informed the ministry that they either have valid contracts or wish to carry out short-term supply transactions, but the use of the exemption is already the company's own decision.

Kodar told BNS that the ministry sent out a letter on June 13 to the Estonian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Estonian Oil Association, the Estonian Logistics and Freight Forwarding Association and the Estonian Bar Association regarding the exemption from the restrictive measures of the Council of the European Union for the import of crude oil and oil products. The letter was based on the adoption of the European Union sanctions package at the beginning of June, with which a sanction to the import of crude oil and oil products from the Russian Federation was also added.

"The first exemption established from this restriction is that the ban on the import of crude oil and petroleum products shall not apply until Dec. 5 to such one-off transactions entered into and carried out before that date for the short-term supply of goods falling under CN code 2709 -- crude oils obtained from petroleum and bituminous minerals -- nor in relation to carrying out such contracts entered into before June 4 for the purchase, import or transfer of these goods, nor in relation to additional contracts necessary for carrying out such contracts," the deputy secretary general said.

According to another exception to the restriction established on the import of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia, the ban on the import of crude oil and petroleum products will not be applied until Feb. 5 of the next year to one-time transactions concluded and carried out before that date for the short-term supply of goods falling under CN code 2710 -- petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals, other than crude -- nor in relation to carrying out such contracts entered into before June 4 for the purchase, import or transfer of these goods, nor in relation to additional contracts necessary for carrying out such contracts.

"Both exemptions apply provided that the member state has notified the Commission of the contracts in question by June 24, 2022 at the latest and of the one-off short-term supply transactions within ten days of their completion. The companies and their business names in the notice are as of the end of June 2022 and do not reflect subsequent business name changes," Kodar said.

The entrepreneurs thus informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that they either have valid contracts or wish to carry out short-term supply transactions. "Requesting an exemption and informing the European Commission about it ensures that the current contract can be fulfilled until the end of the transition period. The intention to request an exception and to notify about the current contracts shows, however, that the company wants to retain the opportunity to use the exemption until the end of the transition period. Whether it is fulfilled is up to the company," he added.

Estonian fuel and energy trader Alexela announced on Wednesday morning that they have not requested an exemption from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to the company, neither the listed Nord Terminals, formerly named Alexela Logistics, nor Alexela Bunkering have applied for an exemption to continue importing Russian oil products, nor do they plan to do so, but instead declared the customer contracts that were valid at the moment of the imposition of sanctions at the request of the ministry.

Member of the management board and CEO of Alexela group Hans Pajoma said that by misleading the public, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has damaged the company's reputation and that Nord Terminals and Alexela Bunkering demand that the information, which they deem to be inaccurate, be publicly refuted immediately.

Similar to several other companies, Operail denied on Wednesday that it has applied for an exemption for the import of sanctioned oil products from Russia. 

On Aug. 30, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs disclosed the named of 28 companies that have, according to the ministry, applied for an exemption to continue importing oil from Russia. These companies are Flexoil OU, Marine Energy Solutions OU, Baltic Marine Bunker AS, Eurodelta OU, Manoir Energy OU, Westnbalticoil OU, SIA ImplexOil, Alexela Bunkering OU, GazTrans Eesti OU, Stacroloft Inc, Fillenergi OU, Himbalt Trade OU, Eesti Aviokutuse Teenuste AS, Aurum Invest OU, Venkon Group OU, LITASCO SA, VNK AS, TRAFIGURA PTE LTD, AS Liwathon E.O.S, AS Operail, United Stream OU, Skinest Veeremi OU, AS NT Bunkering, AS Alexela Logistics, Baltia Trading Company OU, Petrohim International Carriers OU, City Sky OU and Altairbalt OU.

ESTONIA: FIRMS LISTED AS IMPORTING RUSSIAN OIL CAN BE REMOVED IF REQUESTED

The Foreign Ministry is prepared to remove companies from a list it has compiled of firms, which have applied for exemptions on a European Union Russian oil import embargo, at those companies' request, Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu (Isamaa) says.

The ministry published a list on August 31 of just under 30 Estonian companies, which it said, applied for such exemption, leading to reported backlash in public opinion, as well as confusion from at least two firms the subsidiaries of which ended up on the list.

Reinsalu added that he would inform the European Commission about any such requests as they arose.

Speaking at the government's regular lunchtime press conference on September 1, the foreign minister said: "It is not the desire of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be an obstacle in any way. If a company finds that being on the exemptions list is either inconvenient or unfair, taking into account the attitudes of public opinion, and then it does not intend to use this exemption, and if that company informs the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I pledge that we will immediately make this information available to the general public, while of course we will submit additional information to the European Commission that this company requests to be removed from the exemptions list also."

EU member states have asked for exemptions on a bar on Russian oil imports on a transitional basis, ahead of a planned full ban, in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, which started over six months ago.

Reinsalu said: "These countries, during the transitional period, have requested an exception as a way to preserve the right to oil trade in the direction of Russia during the transition period, and they ask for a list of companies and inform about it. Estonia has also done so."

Reinsalu was also keen to highlight that companies, which had asked for such an exemption, close to 30 in Estonia, as published by the ministry, had not engaged in wrong-doing.

"I wish to stress that these companies have in no way acted illegally. This follows the logic of the sixth package sanction agreed by the EU, which permits the exemption. Whether the companies use it or not is for they themselves," he continued.

Estonia has consistently made its voice heard at EU level in calling for oil trade sanctions on Russia to be as extensive as possible.

The transitional period is likely to last until the end of the year, or to February, depending on which type of oil product is in question.

It is up to the Tax and Customs Board (MTA) to assess whether and how much oil has been imported into Estonia under the exemptions, or via transit, Reinsalu added.

Of the 28 companies listed as applying for exemptions on the import of Russian oil, as published by the ministry, there are companies related to freight rail carrier Operail and fuel conglomerate Alexela, though the parent companies say that they themselves have not applied for any such exemption, and are awaiting for clarification from the ministry on the matter.

Estonian FIU: Money flows related to Russia, Belarus have decreased sharply

TALLINN, Sep 02, BNS – According to an analysis by Estonia's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), deposits of Russian and Belarusian persons in Estonia, cross-border payments and payments made with Estonian bank cards in Russia, as well as cash withdrawals made with Estonian bank cards in Russia decreased sharply during the first months of the Russian-Ukrainian war.

The turnover mediated by Estonian virtual currency service providers to Russian customers also decreased, the FIU said in a press release on Friday.

Since the beginning of the war, cross-border payments from Russia to Estonia decreased by 18 percent, falling to 92.6 million euros by May. Payments from Estonia to Russia meanwhile decreased by 40 percent to 72.9 million euros. According to the FIU, cross-border payments with Belarus are characterized by smaller volumes, volatility in volumes, and also a downward trend.

The war has also affected the flow of goods and cross-border payments by country. The volumes of payments have increased with the United Arab Emirates, Armenia, China, Turkey, Georgia and Uzbekistan, among others, or countries which, according to the United States financial intelligence agency FinCEN, may be used to evade the sanctions imposed on Russia and Belarus.

Toomas Plaado, head of the strategic analysis department at the Estonian FIU, said that reports submitted to the FIU, most of which have come from Estonian credit institutions, do not show a significant avoidance of sanctions through these countries.

"Rather, it is indicated by isolated anomalies in cross-border payments and in the import and export of goods," he said, adding that since trends can be ascertained only in the longer term, the FIU will keep a close eye on such transactions.

The volumes of large cross-border transactions by companies of Estonian e-residents were unchanged, speaking of data for April. However, the volumes of large cross-border payments and the amounts of transactions of several companies of Russian citizens engaged in the wholesale trade of motor fuels and electrical materials, and in the production of iron, steel and ferro-alloys increased severalfold.

The analysis also revealed that there have been no sudden changes in the share of Russian clients of Estonian licensed virtual currency service providers. The share of Russian customers in the 52 companies with virtual currency licenses serving Russian customers the most was approximately 12 percent. The nearly 80 percent drop in the turnover of services brokered to Russian customers in May to 3.7 million euros per week was mainly related to the business of one service provider.

Demand for cash in Estonia tripled in the first weeks of the war, but then returned to the pre-war level. The balance of deposits of Russian households and non-financial companies in Estonian credit institutions fell from 83 million euros in February to 53 million euros in June, while the corresponding figure for Belarusian individuals was down from 15 million euros in February to 3 million euros in June.

"The removal of cash from circulation perhaps is primarily related to people's desire to establish a crisis reserve. We also see an increase in the declared export of cash at the Estonian-Russian border, primarily for personal purposes, which rather does not constitute a deviation from the sanction at the moment," Plaado said.

The export of the currencies of the member states of the European Union to Russia for purposes other than personal purposes is prohibited by the financial sanction in force.

The survey is based on data from the FIU, the Financial Supervision Authority, the Police and Border Guard Board, the central bank and the Tax and Customs Board.

Tallinn, 2 September: According to an analysis by Estonia's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), deposits of Russian and Belarusian persons in Estonia, cross-border payments and payments made with Estonian bank cards in Russia, as well as cash withdrawals made with Estonian bank cards in Russia decreased sharply during the first months of the Russian-Ukrainian war.

The turnover mediated by Estonian virtual currency service providers to Russian customers also decreased, the FIU said in a press release on Friday.

Since the beginning of the war, cross-border payments from Russia to Estonia decreased by 18 per cent, falling to 92.6 million euros by May. Payments from Estonia to Russia meanwhile decreased by 40 per cent to 72.9 million euros. According to the FIU, cross-border payments with Belarus are characterized by smaller volumes, volatility in volumes, and also a downward trend.

The war has also affected the flow of goods and cross-border payments by country. The volumes of payments have increased with the United Arab Emirates, Armenia, China, Turkey, Georgia and Uzbekistan, among others, or countries which, according to the United States financial intelligence agency FinCEN, may be used to evade the sanctions imposed on Russia and Belarus.

Toomas Plaado, head of the strategic analysis department at the Estonian FIU, said that reports submitted to the FIU, most of which have come from Estonian credit institutions, do not show a significant avoidance of sanctions through these countries.

"Rather, it is indicated by isolated anomalies in cross-border payments and in the import and export of goods," he said, adding that since trends can be ascertained only in the longer term, the FIU will keep a close eye on such transactions.

The volumes of large cross-border transactions by companies of Estonian e-residents were unchanged, speaking of data for April. However, the volumes of large cross-border payments and the amounts of transactions of several companies of Russian citizens engaged in the wholesale trade of motor fuels and electrical materials, and in the production of iron, steel and ferro-alloys increased severalfold.

The analysis also revealed that there have been no sudden changes in the share of Russian clients of Estonian licensed virtual currency service providers. The share of Russian customers in the 52 companies with virtual currency licenses serving Russian customers the most was approximately 12 per cent. The nearly 80 per cent drop in the turnover of services brokered to Russian customers in May to 3.7 million euros per week was mainly related to the business of one service provider.

Demand for cash in Estonia tripled in the first weeks of the war, but then returned to the pre-war level. The balance of deposits of Russian households and non-financial companies in Estonian credit institutions fell from 83 million euros in February to 53 million euros in June, while the corresponding figure for Belarusian individuals was down from 15 million euros in February to 3 million euros in June.

"The removal of cash from circulation perhaps is primarily related to people's desire to establish a crisis reserve. We also see an increase in the declared export of cash at the Estonian-Russian border, primarily for personal purposes, which rather does not constitute a deviation from the sanction at the moment," Plaado said.

The export of the currencies of the member states of the European Union to Russia for purposes other than personal purposes is prohibited by the financial sanction in force.

The survey is based on data from the FIU, the Financial Supervision Authority, the Police and Border Guard Board, the central bank and the Tax and Customs Board.

Sanctions turn travel from Russia into a privilege: flights at 2,000 euros or two-day bus and train fares

The crossing over the Narva River, the natural border between Estonia and the European Union and Russia, was reminiscent this summer of old movies from Cold War times. The dozens of Russians on the bus scrambled one by one their suitcases in front of Estonian guards while a Ukrainian refugee was interrogated in front of her two children on their flight to Europe. Nearly five hours stuck there, just one leg of a much longer journey. The trip from Moscow to Madrid, which in the past took four and a half hours by direct flight, now requires either paying for a prohibitively expensive flight through the few remaining countries that do not sanction Russia, or losing two days each way between trains, buses and planes. That's almost four days of vacation time if you add up the round trip.

More informationFollow live the latest news on the war in Ukraine"Visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right," declared Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas in an interview with EL PAÍS on 27 August. The head of the Estonian government is perhaps the leader who has used the harshest terms of the EU bloc countries that advocated a total ban on visas for Russians. That argument - which Kallas had earlier included in a tweet - unleashed a wave of criticism in Russia, which has greeted the decision finally taken by the EU with evident discontent. Brussels will not completely eliminate the granting of visas, but it will make obtaining them much more difficult, longer and more expensive, by suspending the 2007 agreement that facilitated the processing of entry permits for Russian tourists in the Schengen zone.

Obtaining one of these visas was not excessively difficult for Russians until now, despite the sanctions. What the punitive measures of the West have already caused is that travel has become a privilege reserved for very few citizens of the country because of the consequences of the Kremlin's offensive on Ukraine. The blockade of the airspace and the sanctions have caused such a shortage of flights that the ticket to Europe alone can cost a Russian the equivalent of two or three months' salary, if he does not cross the land borders with Estonia or Finland.

What used to be just plain travel has now turned into an annoying obstacle course. "I traveled to Madrid after everything [the conflict in Ukraine] started. It was a long, uncomfortable trip and I was very nervous. I had to go from Moscow to St. Petersburg, and from there by bus to Helsinki to catch a plane," Irina Samoylenko, whose daughter, Vera, lives in the Spanish capital, tells EL PAÍS. "We were held for a huge time at the border for an extremely scrupulous inspection. They opened all our suitcases, checked everything. In addition, since our cards don't work, I had to carry all the money on me," she recalls.

These problems do not only affect Russian tourists. This is the case of the Spaniard P. S., who asks to be identified only by his initials. This man lives in Spain but his partner and four-year-old daughter reside in Moscow.

"It used to take me, with a direct flight from Barajas to [Moscow's international airport] Domodedovo, between 10 and 12 hours door to door and it cost me about 400 euros in total. Now I fly with stopovers to Tallinn or Helsinki, from there I take a bus to St. Petersburg, and then a train to Moscow. It takes between 38 and 48 hours and costs me a total of around 700 euros, depending on how far in advance I can buy the tickets," he laments in a telephone conversation a few days after returning home to Spain. These trips, which seem to take forever, can be even longer when the destination is not St. Petersburg or Moscow but cities in distant provinces. This is the test faced by Marina, a Russian woman who lives in Milan and who travels on board the bus that covers the Tallinn-St. Petersburg route: "And I still have another day on the train to Rostov, where there are no flights because it is close to Ukraine". More than 1,700 kilometers separate St. Petersburg and this southern Russian city.

Russian airlines' planes not only run the risk of being blocked when landing in countries that freeze assets of the Slavic country, but since the adoption of sanctions, many of them have been parked because they no longer receive spare parts. All this has led to a gigantic bottleneck of the few Russian flights to "safe" territories, such as some Middle Eastern nations and Turkey. The consequence is that prices have skyrocketed: for example, traveling to Europe with a stopover in Istanbul with a Turkish airline by far exceeds 100,000 rubles, between 1,500 and 2,000 euros at the current exchange rate. "For a family with a child, that's almost 6,000 euros per trip, crazy," stresses Spaniard P. S.

Uncertainty about possible future travel is also absolute. Aliona paid 3,500 euros in May to a visa agency to process a student permit in the Schengen zone. The process is very slow, even more so with the expulsions in recent months of diplomats working in Western consulates, and will now be further complicated by the European decision to break the 2007 fast-track visa agreement. "I see no prospects for my sector in Russia in the next 10 years," tells us this marketing specialist who until now worked organizing events for foreign firms. "Now I'm stuck in Russia as I see how {the impact of] all this news reflects on myself," she laments.

The European veto on tourist visas for Russians is unlikely to have a major impact on most of the population. According to a survey by the Public Opinion Foundation, only 14% of Russians have gone on vacation abroad in the last five years. In the 12 months prior to last August, only 2% of citizens of the Slavic nation had traveled outside its borders. 69% of Russians have never left their country. According to data from the Russian border administration, the top three destinations in 2022 were the Caucasian - and internationally unrecognized - territory of Abkhazia, followed by Turkey and Egypt. The latter two hotel and beach destinations have seen their Russian bookings plummet by half this summer compared to last.

SendingmoneyMoney transfers abroad are another problem facing many Russians and their loved ones. Most banks in the Slavic country have been disconnected from the SWIFT system and Spanish banks often block or make it difficult to send money to Russia. "The last time I passed money was with Western Union, that's not viable now," adds P. S., who in August took with him to Russia "a wad of money" in cash. He spent just three weeks on vacation with his daughter, the first in more than half a year. Previously, making a getaway to Moscow at any time to see her was feasible on a long weekend; in the present circumstances, impossible.

Many Russians have also lost their clients abroad. This is the case of Maria Shelkova, a psychologist and sexologist who used to attend some Russian-speaking patients living abroad telematically. "From the moment the sanctions appeared, it's over. If they have no possibility to send money to a ruble account, I can't get paid," she stresses to this newspaper.

"I had a client from Ukraine, from Kiev. It's funny how the sanctions divide us. This is not about politics, we are ordinary people, with our own ties," Shelkova reflected before explaining that her patient lives in Norway with her husband. "As soon as all this started, she started taking care of refugees: she set up an organization and her parents moved in with her. It put a lot of stress on her and she wanted me to help her. She didn't care that I was Russian and she was Ukrainian. She trusted me. However, she could not send money. We looked for variants through a friend with euro accounts, but it is not convenient and it was time-consuming and time-consuming with commissions. In the end we had to give it up," he said.

The last time he set foot in the European Union was in 2019, on a getaway to France. "Now I can't go there to rest for a week. You lose a lot of travel time and you can't use the Russian card anywhere," he notes in another conversation on the phone from the Maldives. Flying there costs half the price of destinations to Europe, and his 13-hour journey even seems short.

Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland stop entry to Russian tourists through external borders

"Together with Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, we decided to introduce common restrictions on tourism for Russian nationals to protect public order and security," Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said. "Russia has brought war to Europe and is using all tools to undermine our societies. As the border states of the EU, we must keep Europe safe. Currently it is not possible to ensure that the Russian citizens entering the EU through Estonia do not pose a security threat. A regional agreement has been reached and now we will continue working towards a tourism restriction on Russian citizens in the entire European Union."

"Travel to the European Union is a privilege, not a human right. As the people of Ukraine are being tortured, murdered and terrorised, the citizens of the aggressor state should not be able to enjoy the benefits of the free world. We will no longer allow Russian tourists to cross our border, visiting family living in Estonia will remain among exceptions," Kallas said. This was also underlined in the joint statement of the prime ministers of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland today.

Minister of the Interior Lauri Läänemets said we have already imposed a sanction on Russian nationals holding a Schengen visa issued by Estonia but this does not prevent Russian citizens with Schengen visas issued by other states from travelling here or using Estonia for transit. "In view of the EU sanction banning air traffic, Estonia's eastern border is becoming a transit hub. Whereas in February 10 477 Russian citizens crossed Estonia's eastern border, this number has increased to more than 26 500 in July and in the summer months, more than 1000 people per day crossed the border on average. In addition to its own internal security, Estonia, an external border state, is responsible for the entire Schengen area and the mass travel of Russian nationals entails an increased security threat in current circumstances. Every country has the right to close its borders for security considerations and temporarily restrict border crossings, and for ensuring security in the region and the Schengen area more broadly, together with the other Baltic States and Poland we will restrict the transit of Russian tourists," the minister said. Läänemets said that from a moral perspective, it was important to continue looking for a solution on the EU level but at the moment, it was necessary to quickly introduce additional measures to mitigate the threats that tourism transit entails for the internal security and public order of the region.

Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu said that work on a EU-wide solution would continue. "Until we have come to an agreement on EU level on restricting entry for Russian nationals into the European Union, we are imposing these restrictions regionally. This is our legitimate response to the mass movement of Russian tourists through our countries to the rest of Europe." Minister Reinsalu added that continuing with sanctions against Russia was crucial for putting relentless pressure on Russia, and from Estonia's foreign policy perspective, it is a values-based and existential issue.

The restriction does not apply to all Russian citizens. Crossing the state border will continue to be possible for Russian nationals visiting family members or co-parents of minor children living in the Schengen area on a valid legal basis. Exemptions will continue to apply to diplomats; Russian nationals with a short-stay visa and registered employment in Estonia or with a student visitor visa, as well as for people directly employed in the international transport of goods and passengers. Exceptional entry is also allowed on humanitarian grounds and for dissidents. Transit without delay is also allowed to people who need to travel through Estonia to reach their country of residence. Exemptions will also apply when crossing Latvian, Lithuanian and Polish borders.

As of Monday, Russian nationals have 49 804 valid visas issued by Estonia, 47 998 of which are short-stay visas and 1805 are long-stay visas. The purpose of travel is tourism in 19 285 cases and in 20 389 cases it is visiting family and friends. Other countries issue more than three million Schengen visas a year, valid for up to five years and allowing multiple entry to the Schengen area. According to estimates, at least 10 million Russian citizens hold a valid short-stay Schengen visa.

The government's decision invalidates the current restriction on entry or the so-called Russian and Belarusian sanction regulation; new restrictions are introduced according to the State Borders Act. The Government Communication Unit will publish the order and the explanatory memorandum on the website https://kriis.ee/en/travelling-crossing-state-border/travelling-estonia/visas-russian-citizens[https://kriis.ee/en/travelling-crossing-state-border/travelling-estonia/visas-russian-citizens], where you can find additional information and answers to frequently asked questions.

Estonian MP views emergency situation at Belarus-EU border

After Latvia recently reported the growing pressure at illegal border crossings on its border with Belarus, Estonia immediately suggested providing its specialists and technical equipment, an Estonian MP has written in an op-ed. He blamed Belarus for triggering a migrant crisis. The following is the text of an opinion piece by Reform Party MP and former defence minister Kalle Laanet, entitled "Kalle Laanet: Valgevene has restarted pressure on the Latvian border. What should be done?" and published by the Estonian daily newspaper Eesti Paevaleht (subscription) on 7 September:

There continues to be a state of emergency on the borders of Poland, Lithuania and Latvia with Belarus, in order to prevent illegal border crossings.

"The continuing attack on Belarusian borders against neighbours has led to the most volatile security crisis in the past 30 years." This is what I wrote last November. Today, a year later, it is appropriate to look back - what has happened to our security during this year.

There continues to be a state of emergency on the borders of Poland, Lithuania and Latvia with Belarus, in order to prevent illegal border-crossings. Last week, the Latvian State Border Guard reported about the growing pressure of illegal border-crossings on their borders. Estonia has acted in solidarity, of course, by sending all kinds of help to neighbours, including well-trained people and technical equipment.

The situation completely changed on 24 February, of course, when Russia, dictated by Putin's regime, began a full-scale attack on Ukraine. Today we are certain that Belarusian hybrid attacks on borders had been conducted on Putin's orders and with his support in order to test the West's unity and cause domestic divisions in the Baltic states and Poland. The West was united in its fight against hybrid attacks and has remained united also in supporting Ukraine in repelling Russia's military attacks. Let us hope that the so-called "us" will not be troubled by war fatigue, primarily among allies because among Ukrainians we will of course not see it. They have no other choice than to fight for their freedom, home and homeland, for their children and their future - all the way to the victory.

What kind of activities did we plan back then in order for military threats not to be transferred to Estonia?

Firstly, to ensure situation awareness among allies, constant information exchanges, and - what is of key importance in hybrid warfare - filtering out fake information in order to avoid weakening allies' decisiveness resulting from this. On the positive side we can say that a common enemy unified the West more than the political and cultural rhetoric until then.

Demonstrating the unity and decisiveness of allies so that the [Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, Alyaksandr] Lukashenka regime, which is supported by Russia, would be unable to achieve its goal, including to destabilise the Baltic states, Poland and the European Union in general. Joint expressions of support as well as real contributions to help Poland and Lithuania were significant in this. Estonia was a spokesperson and a vanguard actor in helping our neighbours.

Additional sanctions of the European Union on the Belarusian direction are significant and we have fully supported their immediate application. Also in this activity, Estonia was one of the spokespersons and Estonia drove the initiation of sanction packages imposed on Russia.

Estonia must significantly accelerate the construction of the Eastern border in order to be ready for pressure or even an attack on our state border. We took major steps toward establishing a physical border.

Significantly increasing Estonia's ammunition reserves, to purchase new weapons systems and strengthen early warning systems, so that we would be better prepared for a real military conflict. For that we allocated an additional over 900 million euros for the defence budget.

Explaining that the war in Ukraine is not only about the deaths of Ukrainian children, women and men and the destruction of [Ukrainian] statehood and people on the battleground. The war's impacts extend to Estonia on a daily basis.

Like we can see, past assessments have proven right and the activity following from them is continuing. Here we should not pay too much attention to the emotional discussions between former and current actors in the defence field, which have been featured in the media [author refers to controversy around the sudden departure of Mikk Marran, director general of Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service]. Rather soon such interludes will belong to the past and at most they will viewed as a storm in the teacup.

All of us have of course more areas of concern in our homes, in the parliament and the government. We do not know to what extent the autumn Covid wave will reach us and how much it will affect our daily activities. And life has always surprises in store... But what should be done, in this case?! Like my late mother-in-law Aliide Koopuu always said, "Kids, the main thing is that there would be no war. We will take care of the rest!" So, let us do everything so that the war would end in Ukraine and would not reach our home country!

MEP Terras: Instead of worrying about Russia, Toom should show concern for Ukrainians

TALLINN, Sep 09, BNS – Estonian Member of the European Parliament Riho Terras said in a press release on Friday that imposing entry restrictions on Russian citizens is the only possible solution and MEP Yana Toom should think about citizens of Ukraine instead of defending the interests of Russia. 

"Traveling around Europe on a tourist visa is not a human right. As a result of criminal military action by Russia, innocent Ukrainians are perishing and millions have been forced to flee their homes. Russian citizens bear co-responsibility for the crimes committed," Terras said.

The MEP from Isamaa party said that 75 percent of Russians support the bloodshed waged by Putin against the Ukrainian people.

"The visa ban is a concrete and strong measure to sanction Russia. The decision by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland to impose an entry ban on them is therefore the only thinkable option," Terras said.

According to Terras, Toom is mistaken in claiming that a dangerous precedent is being set with the entry ban.

"Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine is dangerous. The entry restriction is its consequence. Instead of defending Russian interests, Yana Toom should think about those Ukrainians who have lost their lives due to the military action by Russia," Terras said.

MEP Yana Toom has sent an inquiry to European Commission Vice-President Josep Borrell, arguing that Estonia, along with three other EU member states, has breached Schengen border rules by imposing an entry ban on Russian citizens with a Schengen tourist visa from Sept. 19.

Toom maintains that any 'blanket ban' on the entry into the European Union by citizens holding a valid Schengen tourist visa issued by a member state would constitute a breach of the Schengen Borders Code and seriously undermine the European legal order. As the Schengen acquis is one the fundamental pillars of the European Union, an initiative from several member states to breach the provisions, sets a dangerous precedent, according to Toom.

On Thursday, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas announced that, according to an agreement between Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, the four countries will impose entry restrictions on Russian citizens with Schengen tourist visas from Sept. 19.

TALLINN, Sep 13, BNS – Members of the European Parliament have appealed to the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and Jan Lipavsky, the foreign minister of the Czech presidency of the EU, for an EU-wide visa ban to be imposed on Russian and Belarusian military personnel, officials of the central government and their families as a sanction. 

Among others, Estonian MEP Urmas Paet backs the call for the upgrade to the visa ban.

"I remain of the opinion that a general European Union tourist visa ban should be imposed on Russian tourists," Paet said. "However, since the member states have not been able to agree on this so far, we still need to move forward with the restrictions," the former longtime foreign minister of Estonia said.

According to the MEPs, the visa ban should apply to all members of the armed forces of Russia and Belarus and their families, as well as central government officials and their families.

TALLINN, Sep 19, BNS - Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland have barred entry on their external borders for all Russian nationals with a short-stay Schengen visa starting Monday, Sept. 19. 

The restriction does not apply to all Russian citizens. Crossing the state border will continue to be possible for Russian nationals visiting family members or co-parents of minor children living in Estonia on a valid legal basis. Exemptions will continue to apply to diplomats; Russian nationals with a short-stay visa and registered employment in Estonia or with a student visitor visa, as well as for people directly employed in the international transport of goods and passengers.

TALLINN, Sep 20, BNS - A woman from the northeastern Estonian city of Kohtla-Jarve, who congratulated Russian military personnel on Facebook, has been summoned by the police to give her explanations and has seen the police open formal proceedings, Rus.PostimeesRus.Postimees, the Russian-language online edition of Postimees, reported.

The police have yet to decide about the penalty. 

The Kohtla-Jarve resident, Galina Kisseljova, posted a Facebook postcard on Aug. 2, congratulating men on Paratroopers' Day, a professional military holiday celebrated in Russia on Aug. 2 annually. A week later, she received a summons to the police.

Kisseljova learned from the investigator that the postcard she shared on her social media wall was an act of aggression and a symbol of war crimes.

According to the Penal Code of Estonia, it is not allowed to display symbols like this in public. 

"I do not justify any crime, including military ones! I explained that I was congratulating those who served 30 and more years ago, you can see it in the message of congratulation itself," Kisseljova told Rus.PostimeesRus.Postimees.

Kisseljova is sure that she did nothing wrong. She assumed that her joking phrase, "Happy holiday to all who served. Just don't bathe in fountains," could be pleasant to men of all nationalities.

The police started a misdemeanor proceeding to find out the circumstances of the publication on the social network. The goal is to find out whether the person supports the aggression by the Russian Federation, Oleg Kornoljov, an officer for oversight over the online environment at the East Prefecture of the Police and Border Guard Board, said.

"No decision has yet been made in Kisseljova's case, which is why the police cannot comment further at this time," the officer said.

Amid the war in Ukraine, the Baltic states are acting in a united front — for instance, they have stopped issuing tourist visas to Russians or are removing Soviet-era monuments. On the other hand, each particular country uses its own methods of opposing the Putin regime. For instance, Lithuania is planning[https://www.delfi.lt/ru/news/live/lishat-grazhdanstva-za-neloyalnost-k-litve-eksperty-ocenili-predlozheniya-deputatov-sejma.d?id=91030661] to strip people of its citizenship for supporting Russia, and Latvia to restrict[https://www.grani.lv/economics-latvia/133284-v-latvii-hotyat-ogranichit-russkiy-yazyk-v-obschestvennyh-mestah-i-na-rabote.html] the use of the Russian language at work and at public places.

Anyway, these are only plans thus far, while Estonia has already banned its colleges from admitting students from Russia since the very start of the war, and it is only when this move caused a stir that it allowed those who are already receiving an education in the country to complete their studies.

Journalist Ilya Azar travelled around Estonia and spoke to some of the local Russians unhappy about the fact that the anti-Putin campaign launched by local policymakers is affecting their lives, as well as Estonians who do not object too much to their government’s decisions.

A tank and memory

A Soviet T-34 tank has stood on a highway between Narva and the town of Narva-Joesuu since the 1970s. Narva residents liked the tank very much, and taking pictures against its backdrop used to be an essential element of their wedding ceremonies.

The tank was put on a tractor unit and taken away to a museum outside of Tallinn on 16 August, even though local residents were unhappy about it and the local administration had not authorised this. A number of other Soviet monuments in Narva and its suburbs were demolished on the same day, as well.

Yana Toom, a European Parliament member from Estonia, a red-haired woman in bright hipster-style glasses, was in Narva-Joesuu that day, a community not far away from the place. Her trip was unrelated to the tank monument.

“I like to come here, and I decided this year to give my kids some rest and take my grandchildren with me. But in the end, I have to give live interviews and waste my time on other kinds of shameful things,” Toom explains with her typical sarcasm. Her grandson and granddaughter eat ice cream at the beginning of our conversation and then run away to have some fun at a nearby playground.

Toom, an ethnic Russian, often criticises the Estonian government. Speaking about the tank, she points out that all the monuments that have already been demolished were owned by the local self-government, and the City Council did not decide that the tank must be removed (some of the lawmakers favour its preservation, and others were afraid to lose any support from local voters).

“The locals had been prepared for its dismantlement, and everyone had come to terms with that, but the way this was done...

Narva residents told me that a plane flying over the city had woken them up, and then people in balaclavas arrived to dismantle the tank. But why not talk about that first?” Toom says.

Locals have set up a sort of makeshift memorial in place of the tank, forming a heart with candles and roses and placing a toy tank in its centre. While I was there, Narva residents kept coming to the memorial by their cars for ten minutes or so. Men would stand silently with their arms crossed over their chests or say something angrily, and some women would weep. No police were present.

If you are unaware what actually happened here, you could easily assume that people come to commemorate some celebrity killed in a car crash.

An elderly woman tells me tearfully: “They said we’ll go to the future together with them, but I don’t know how to go to the future with them... But I do know how much the Russian people suffered, how much they built here and what’s left of this.”

She says her husband and she had come here on their wedding day, and she has also been there each Victory Day.

“This is our history and our memory. People gave their lives to liberate this land. This is so painful! So many people died, and we know what that war cost. [Estonians] visit the monument to the Nazis, and by the way, it’s not out of nothing that Russia resorted to that step in Ukraine,” the woman says, refusing to introduce herself.

“Do you support that step?” I press her to make things clear.

“This is a provocation to sow discord between Russians and Estonians,” her husband breaks in. “The Anglo-Saxons want to make another Ukraine here.”

The wife shuts him up but keeps complaining, “What’s in store for us? They say America has set off some explosion, and that’s serious!”

The opinion that the war in Ukraine was started by the U.S. is very popular among the visitors of the improvised memorial.

“All of this has been done at the Americans’ behest. Anyway, what was wrong about that tank?” an elderly man laments.

“It’s not monuments they don’t like but us, the Russians. They don’t like it that we remember everything, and so they want to erase our memory,” a dignified old man says in a trained voice, as if he were a professional actor.

“But you remember, don’t you?”

“It’s true, but I fear that our children and grandchildren will forget it, and that’s exactly why it’s been done. After all, they’ve been rewriting the history of WWII for a long time, saying that it’s America and England that won it, not the USSR. In my opinion, Estonia won’t live long enough this way,” the old man predicts suddenly.

“I am surprised that Putin is too peaceful, or otherwise he’d cut off gas and oil supply to them in the blink of an eye,” responds the man who started the conversation.

Another elderly man comes to the memorial on a bicycle and lays a picture of a tank to the flowers, the caption saying, “Many thanks for everything! Remember and will remember.”

“I come here not only on 9 May but also on other holidays. My grandfather was wounded outside of Tallinn and liberated Narva. This is not okay, they shouldn’t have touched our memories. But nothing will work for them! People have visited and will keep visiting this place,” he says, gradually rising his voice.

“But why have they done this at all?”

“We have Nazis in power! They’d better create jobs and address electricity and gas bills,” the man replies, walking away to pick up his bike.Two different Estonias

I would recommend that those Russians who have long been absent from their country and miss it but cannot return there now should travel to Narva, where nearly 90% of the local population are ethnic Russians. The first person I met in Narva upon getting off the bus was a young man in a T-shirt featuring a Kalashnikov assault rifle on the chest and a Russian flag on the shoulder.

“Can you really walk around here like this?” I wonder.

“I bought it in Estonia, and so I think I can,” the guy answers me, putting quail eggs he bought in the store in the boot of his car. “I even have a receipt at home.”

It’s almost impossible to hear Estonian speech in the city, and therefore, a journalist from Delfi showed me a local Irish pub where bartenders and waiters speak on principle only in the official language.

Mihhail Stalnuhhin, a member of the Estonian parliament and a writer, was of course in Narva together with some of his voters when the tank was being removed. He is an outspoken critic of the demolition of Soviet monuments in Estonia, arguing[https://rus.err.ee/1608705529/stalnuhin-mne-ne-za-chto-i-ne-pered-kem-izvinjatsja] that this campaign has been prompted by pro-Nazi beliefs of its initiators and Estonia’s economic problems.

“Numerous people are asking questions, as electricity bills this July were three or three-and-a-half times bigger than last July. Everyone perfectly understands that there’ll be something unimaginable with the heating this coming winter,” Stalnuhhin said.

He tells me that Estonian sawmills and the local chemical industry cannot operate because of restrictions on timber and gas supplies from Russia, and the local travel businesses are suffering from the closed borders.

“Against this backdrop, the government needs a small but a successful war, and Estonia can fight successfully only its own people but cannot its neighbours,” Stalnuhhin says with a sigh. “The tank is just a decoy and a way to show [Estonian voters] what great guys they are.”

“But why is that tank so important to you?” I ask, because I don’t quite understand why the memory of the dead should be honoured near a tank where nobody is buried.

“I believe you can’t find a single family in Narva whose ancestors did not fight in the WWII. My uncle was a pilot, and he died when he was very young, at 18. One of my grandfathers fought with the Estonian Rifle Corps, and the other one was executed as a partisan. There is a stele in Gus-Zhelezny (a town in Russia’s Ryazan region — translator’s note), and there is the name of Mikhail Stalnukhin carved on it, after whom I was named. Whoever you take here, all of them have relatives who fought, and some of them died. The same goes for the other side (meaning Estonians — author’s note), but they forget that they fought on both sides. Therefore, the country that had been a country of descendants of [the Soviet] Estonian Rifle Corps before 1991 turned later into a country of descendants of the 20th Waffen SS Division. They simply can’t understand that. Perhaps you can’t understand that, either. But to us everything is clear.”

When Stalnuhhin was getting married, he also came to the tank to have a picture.

“This tank is dear to us, it’s part of us. I’ll remind you about Arnold Meri, the first Estonian Hero of the Soviet Union, who served with the 22nd Estonian Territorial Rifle Corps. I once travelled together with him on a train at night, and he told me how everything was wiped out here with artillery fire, and the place was literally covered with heaps of dead bodies, which nobody removed for half a year afterwards. What are we supposed to do about that? Erect heaps of monuments stretching for 15 kilometres? That tank symbolised all of this,” he explains.

Just like any local, Stalnuhhin mentions the cross[https://militaryheritagetourism.info/ru/military/sites/view/329?0] that was erected in 1994 in memory of the Estonian 20th Waffen SS Division at Sinimaed Hills.

“It’s like about non-traditional sexual orientation here. What happens in the bedroom concerns solely two people. If you feel some affection to the SS, what can I do about it?

We have the understanding that people may have different opinions, but they don’t,” Stalnuhhin resents.

I ask him whether he thinks that the Soviet tank has become inappropriate after Russia started the war in Ukraine, but he disagrees. Instead of answering my question, he tells me that “the things are really wild as concerns corruption and the judicial system in Ukraine” and that “Ukraine is not a European-level country.”“What does it have to do with that?” I am a bit stunned.

“It does, because when [Estonia] expresses solidarity with Ukraine, it’s in fact hatred toward Russia,” Stalnuhhin replies. With his refined manners mixed with conservative rhetoric, he looks to me a bit like some 19th-century Slavophile author.

It appears to me that Stalnuhhin embraces the official Russian view on the events in Ukraine, although he does not say this directly.

“I have to watch my mouth, because what I say and you publish later determines not only my future but also the future of the people I work together with.”

“But regardless of your attitude toward the war, it is going on, and it obviously affects attitudes toward everything Russian,” I say.

“Well, right, let’s ban Tchaikovsky and Dostoevsky,” Stalnuhhin replies sarcastically.

“That would be too much, of course,” I agree.

“During the past war, Goethe wasn’t banned in the USSR, but Pushkin is being outlawed in Ukraine now. In such situations, I always suggest that people recall The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. After all, nobody remembers that its author wrote articles demanding that the Indians be exterminated completely,” Stalnuhhin recalls for some reason.

David Vseviov, a professor with a degree in cultural history, has been hosting the Mysterious Russia radio show for nearly 30 years. He started his lectures long ago with the Byzantine era, and one of his recent programmes was about the Cuban Missile Crisis. He believes there was no alternative to the tank’s removal.

“When milk comes to the boil and overflows, you can turn off the stove, but that won’t help anymore. When only emotions are left, then there is no solution,” Vseviov explains the situation to me and compares the tank with the Bronze Soldier, a monument to the Soviet liberators of Tallinn (its removal in 2007 caused serious riots in Estonia — author’s note). “As a historian, I’d wish we could treat our past calmly, for we should remember both good and bad things. After all, we don’t plant former concentration camps in Poland with shrubs, we leave them as they are so as not to forget,” Vseviov notes reasonably, but then arrives at the same controversial conclusion: “But when behind this monument or another are absolutely different interpretations of history and absolutely different interpretations of events that happened [in Estonia], unfortunately, there can be no other choice.”

He explains to me that Estonians do not want to see symbols of Estonia’s occupation by the Soviet Union, over which the country lost one-fifth of its entire population.

“When we travel around India and see a swastika, it does not elicit [too negative] emotions in us, because it is placed within its inherent cultural environment there. When we see tanks with letter Z firing upon peaceful cities and civilians in news programmes, this highlights the essence of the symbol. Therefore, when someone lays flowers to the tank, they do not only commemorate those who died in that war, but they also offer symbolic support to the actions of [Russian] tanks now, and Estonia doesn’t want to tolerate this,” he says.Unproductive Russophobia

At the end of August, Filipp Loss, art director of the Russian Theatre in Tallinn, wrote a Facebook post[https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid036Q7kArEHyAcfmKSDPAc3HyGtd6i5doqiQ6WzA2Wk6y4v2WUnYRakAMySLRq9g799lid=100001589269728] alleging that, with the start of the Ukraine war, “filthy rotten Russophobia has started crawling out of the woodwork” in Estonia and compared problems being experienced by ethnic Russians in the country to the situation in which Jews found themselves during WWII.

As Delfi journalists put it[https://rus.delfi.ee/statja/120060954/filipp-los-ya-ne-sravnivayu-nyneshnyuyu-situaciyu-s-tragediey-holokosta-no-samye-strashnye-veshchi-vsegda-nachinayutsya-s-vrazhdy-i-ushchemleniya-prav], Loss’s words “really blew up the Estonian community.”

“In my post, I shared my concerns about the rampant Russophobia in Estonia, citing as an example what happened to the Jews before WWII. It also started with ‘innocent’ discriminatory measures to end up in a catastrophe: a whole nation was blamed for all kinds of sins based on their ethnicity, which later led to heinous crimes,” Loss says explaining his point to me.

The post triggered heated debates in Estonian media, but the art director was supported mainly by Russian-speaking residents of the country. He says some of them have even stopped and thanked him in the street.

“It’s obvious that the problem of discrimination against Russian citizens should be discussed publicly, as this affects the interests of a substantial part of Estonian society and runs counter to the spirit of freedom, democracy, and friendship between nations,” says Loss.

Even though the Russian Theatre’s art director tried to explain in interviews that followed up that he did not mean to draw direct parallels between the Holocaust and visa restrictions, most Estonians felt deeply insulted. European parliamentarian Urmas Paet demanded[https://rus.postimees.ee/7596301/urmas-paet-vid-na-zhitelstvo-hudruka-russkogo-teatra-nuzhno-otmenit-uzhe-segodnya] that Loss’s “job contract and residence permit be annulled immediately.” The Estonian Directors and Dramaturgs Union (EDDU) expelled Loss, saying that his statement “denigrates the Estonian nation, state, and culture.”

Loss’s contract as the Russian Theatre’s art director was to expire on 5 September, and it was not extended. The theatre’s director, Svetlana Jantsek, took over the job temporarily, while Loss was supposed to stay in the theatre as stage director.

However, on September 12, Jantsek terminated that contract with him, as well.

“She decided that she had the right to sack me based on that Facebook post. She wrote that I had undermined the Russian Theatre’s reputation and even put its very existence at risk. That said, members of the theatre’s board did not consider it necessary to apply repressive measures to me, and so that was her personal decision,” Loss says.

The former art director is determined to go to court to demand his reinstatement in his favourite job. He is not planning to leave Estonia.

“Something done by a particular person cannot change my attitude toward my colleagues from the Russian Theatre and the entire theatrical community of Estonia, a country that I love and where I’d like to live,” he says.

Shortly before those dramatic events, I had been to Loss’s office at the Russian Theatre. While he did not compare Estonia to Nazi Germany during our conversation, he still spoke quite harshly.

“Rejecting everything related to Russia, breaking up all cultural, scientific, educational, and other ties (which Estonia, as well as the other Baltic states, did at the very start of the war — author’s note) looks absolutely unproductive to me. What’s more, it actually contributes to the Putin regime’s unbridled aggression rather than opposes it. This only foments tension, fear, and enmity. This only fuels aggression, which all of us want to resist,” says Loss, a big and amiably-looking man.

The state-run Russian Theatre had not experienced pressure from the Estonian government before the end of the summer.

“Fortunately, nobody seriously tried to make us remove the word Russian from our name (something that happened[https://www.delfi.lt/ru/news/live/russkij-dramteatr-litvy-predlagayut-reformirovat-v-teatr-nacmenshinstv-ideya-uzhe-obsuzhdaetsya.d?id=89909479] in Lithuania — author’s note). Our theatre hosted a traditional theatrical festival on World Theatre Day, and even though some had proposed that the venue be changed, the majority of Estonia’s theatrical community said no. We had the Estonian president and parliamentarians here, all of them were happy, and all came together. After all, we see ourselves as part of Estonia and jointly oppose the aggression,” Loss said.

There has been no talk about ending the government financing of the Russian Theatre, not to mention shutting it down.

“I think this would be utterly absurd, for our theatre is one of those bridges that link Russian and Estonian cultures, and it serves as a guarantor of peace and accord in society,” Loss said.

“So it turns out these bridges are no longer necessary?” I ask him.

“You just can’t move one-third of the Estonian population somewhere overnight. These people feel like a part of this country, but it’s a Russian part, and you can’t just issue a decree and forbid these people to be Russian,” he says.

“But you can shut down the theatre.”

“You can. You can also forbid people to speak in Russian and strip them of their citizenship for that. There are no boundaries to idiocy. But you should be aware why you do something.”

Of course, Loss complains about ruptures of cultural ties with Russia.

“We were confronted with the fact that the agreement on cultural cooperation between Estonia and Russia has been severed for three years, but the Estonian theatrical community is deeply rooted in Russia. Many people who are seen as cultural icons here studied in Russia and collaborated with Russian theatres. Numerous actors have regularly come here, and the entire Estonian elite has always been eager to attend Golden Mask guest performances. Tours, festivals — all of this became unwanted immediately.”

For instance, the playwright Vyacheslav Durnenkov was supposed to come from Russia to work full-time at the Russian Theatre this coming winter, but alas.

“I cannot invite a stage director or an actor from Russia for purely legal reasons now, although I believe there should be exemptions. After all, in the current situation, it’s very important to take into account this person’s civic position, their attitude toward the war, and their interrelations with Putin’s government. For many excellent and honest people, working abroad is the only opportunity to survive nowadays,” complains Loss.

What matters even more, in his words, is not particular persons but the state’s strategy.

“What many view as deterrence of Russia is pointless, in my opinion. This breaks up the few ties that still exist between Russia and Europe, between Russian and European culture. The people who are imposing all these sanctions steer in the same direction as Putin does, namely toward isolating Russia. Virtually any move made by the Estonian authorities automatically gets in the crosshairs of Putin’s propaganda.

Didn’t they ever think why anything they do plays into the hands of Putin and his entourage? Why help Putin sail toward outright tyranny?”

He maintains that the local elites expect to score political points to win the next elections “by showing what strong politicians they are and how much tougher they are than the rest of Europe in countering Russia’s aggression.” The art director does not justify the war and describes the Russian army’s actions as monstrous, and yet he is sure that Putin’s goal is “a total break-up with the European civilisation,” and Estonia is helping him to achieve it, which is “wrong, preposterous, and harmful.”

Loss points out that one-third of the Estonian population speaks in Russian, and these people are as legitimate Estonian residents as all the others, many of whom have been living here for generations.

“Why insult them and live in fear, thinking all the time what those Russians might be up to tomorrow? Wouldn’t it be better to communicate with those people as much as possible, try to understand and take into consideration their sentiments? Isn’t it a more farsighted policy? If this idiot (Putin — author’s note) uses a nuclear weapon tomorrow, it’s curtains for us. And if [the Estonian authorities] think that what they’re doing can avert this threat, they’re sadly mistaken,” he says.

What is interesting is that virtually all government buildings in the Baltic countries have displayed Ukrainian flags, but there are none on the Russian Theatre.

“Some might criticise you for not supporting Ukraine enough,” I tell the art director.

“We are the Russian Theatre, but this is not a reason for us to display a Russian flag. But if someone thinks that they can stop the war by hoisting a Ukrainian flag, they’re also deluded. If you want to fight for the good cause, take up arms and go fighting. If you want to help, find those who are in trouble and help them. I have refugees from Ukraine living in my apartment now. I want the bloodshed, killings, and mutual hatred to stop as soon as possible. I understand that this is mostly utopian, but I am for peace,” Loss answers.

He has been working in Estonia for the sixth year and does not want to return to Russia.

“I left Russia because I wanted to live and work in Estonia. I recently travelled to Moscow and met my relatives and friends, but my home is here. I sincerely share Estonia’s interests. I wish this country all well. It’s not that I fall asleep and wake up thinking about Russia, but I am concerned about Russians living here. They are my spectators and my compatriots,” says Loss.Studying for nothing

Adam Alidibirov, a student of the Narva College of the University of Tartu, does not care either about the Soviet tank or the Russian Theatre and is concerned about quite different problems.

“I learned that this tank existed only after all of this started. It doesn’t mean anything to me personally. I don’t care if they’ve removed it,” he says.

Alidibirov came to Estonia from Chechnya two years ago to study and qualify as an IT specialist.

“My goal was to leave Chechnya for any other place. And not Russia, because they’ll find you there. Estonia had a program under which you had to learn the Estonian language for one year for free and then study IT. Naturally, I thought this was a cool opportunity, and so I was interviewed, passed tests, and was admitted,” he says.

Immediately after the Ukraine war started, the University of Tartu (to which the Narva College belongs), as well as other Estonian universities and colleges, refused[https://rus.delfi.ee/statja/96181391/ne-prinimat-rossiyskih-studentov-v-tartuskiy-universitet-eto-oshibka] to admit students from Russia. Alidibirov and other students were assured at the time that this measure would not apply to them, but the war was continuing, and the Baltic countries began coming up with more ideas as to how to oppose Russians. In August, the Estonian government decided not only to stop issuing residence permits to Russians, but also to stop extending the valid ones.

This directly affected about 80 Russian and Belarusian students of the Narva College, because Estonia normally grants a standard student residence permit for three years (as the term of study), but most of those students had to spend the first year of their stay in Estonia to learn the official language.

The decision came as a complete surprise to Alidibirov.

“I didn’t expect that they would [make the decision] based solely on nationality. I thought they’d see what kind of a person it is. If someone supports the war and draws Z, that’s quite understandable,” he says.

Alidibirov said he did not know a single student campaigning for or even supporting the war. On the contrary, many have volunteered to help Ukrainian refugees in Narva.

The University of Tartu declined to help its students, and so they appealed[https://rus.postimees.ee/7587361/student-pozvolte-uchitsya-i-rabotat-v-estonii-tem-grazhdanam-rossii-kotorye-etogo-dostoyny] to the television and printed media and launched a petition[https://rus.delfi.ee/statja/120050060/aktivistka-iz-narvy-gosudarstvo-obuchalo-rossiyskih-studentov-a-teper-ne-daet-im-primenit-znaniya-v-estonii]. It took them only one day to collect enough signatures in support for their petition to make it obligatory for the parliament to consider it. This prompted the authorities to review their decision and allow those already staying in Estonia to complete their studies, but they would still have to leave the country after completing it.

Alidibirov reasons that this decision does not help either Estonia or Ukraine in any way.

“This is absolutely illogical and pointless. When we applied to study here, one of the selection criteria was our desire to stay in Estonia and apply knowledge we gain here. In the end, they’ve enrolled students, taught them for four years, and now they’re sending them back!” he says in surprise.

“But the war broke out,” I say.

“True, you can say that this explains it, but how reasonable is this decision? I am not saying that [the Estonian authorities] are bad. But knowing that I’ve wasted two years is frustrating. I understand there are people whose situations are even worse, and I don’t demand anything.

If they don’t change this decision, I’ll have to move to another country, but it took me a year and a half here to start standing on my own feet,” he complains.

Alidibirov says he feels absolutely at home in Estonia now, although seeing how uncomfortable he feels being interviewed by a journalist, it is clear to me that it was quite hard to do for a Chechen. During his first year in Estonia, he travelled to live in Tallinn and Tartu, as Narva is the wrong place to get immersed in an Estonian language environment.

“I am learning not only the language, but also literature and films, like, for instance November[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6164502/]. I immerse myself in Estonian culture not because I am being forced to or because I need this but because I am interested,” the young Chechen says.

He even customised his web browser to be able to highlight any Estonian word and see immediately how it is inflected for case and how it is used.

Alidibirov says he personally has not experienced discrimination in Estonia. On the contrary, everyone praises his attempts to speak in Estonian.

“Perhaps the attitudes toward local Russians are such here because they don’t learn the Estonian language and don’t try to integrate into society,” he reasons.

I ask Alidibirov whether he feels any guilt for what is happening in Ukraine and what he thinks about collective responsibility.

“I don’t feel any guilt, that’s what I can say for sure. I grew up in Chechnya during the war started by Russia. As soon as I reached voting age, I left, and therefore, I didn’t vote in elections and didn’t attend rallies. Therefore, I think I have nothing to be blamed for. It’s the people making decisions who are to blame,” Alidibirov says, admitting at the same time that he does bear some responsibility, as well as all those who have a Russian passport.

Filipp Loss, former art director of the Russian Theatre in Tallinn, also says he does not think he should feel ashamed for being Russian.

“While I am a Russian Jew, and now already an Estonian Jew, I feel absolutely no desire to abandon my Russianness. This would be absolutely unnatural and absurd for me. This would mean losing myself,” Loss says.

He says he understands and does not condemn people who feel ashamed, describing this feeling as their protective response.

“I sympathise with the people who find it emotionally hard to admit that their country is an aggressor. I am also really unhappy about it, but at the biological level, this doesn’t make me feel overwhelmingly ashamed and doesn’t prompt me to cut off and discard anything that links me with Russia,” he says.

On the other hand, he says seeing what numerous European policymakers chiefly do makes him feel “a natural desire to defend my Russianness.”

“I feel pain for my country, but I also feel pain when someone tries to humiliate it. Perhaps the Russian world idea is hopelessly discredited for long, but I am absolutely unwilling to get rid of my Russianness. Russia’s history has lots of pages I keep being proud of. And the war against Ukraine is just a disgraceful episode, and there’ve been quite a few disgraceful episodes in Russia’s history,” Loss said.

Adam Alidibirov is particularly perplexed by Estonia’s intention to expel even students trained to teach the Estonian language.

“There is a huge shortage of teachers in Ida-Virumaa (the county where Narva is located and which is inhabited chiefly by ethnic Russians — author’s note) as it is, and now they’re also kicking out those whom they’ve trained for three years. I just can’t understand where else in the world teachers of the Estonian language are in demand, apart from Estonia itself,” says Alidibirov.

The same concerns medical doctors, who have come from Russia and learned Estonian but who are being sent back now.

Polina Oskolskaya, a doctoral student at the University of Tartu’s Institute of Estonian and General Linguistics, also wonders where else teachers of Estonian might be needed. She specialises in Finno-Ugric culture, and all her life in Russia was related to the Estonian language.

“I learned it in Russia, and I taught it in Russia, too,” she says.

There were two or three teachers of the Estonian language per five million people living in St. Petersburg at the time, she says.

Since last year, Oskolskaya has been studying in Tartu, writing longreads on specifics of the Estonian version of Russian, and running a Telegram channel[https://t.me/dotartunedaleko].

“I have a residence permit as a doctoral student. People completing their masters’ or doctoral programs earlier tried to find a job in Estonia, but now they won’t have this opportunity,” she says sadly.

“Moreover, even though they allowed such students to complete their courses, they might change their mind, as well,” I note.

“That’s true, and that’s why I don’t feel confident. I have no feeling that I can stay here writing my doctoral thesis for another two years and not be worried about anything.”

Irina Belobrovtseva, doctor of philology and professor of Russian literature at Tallinn University’s Institute of Slavonic Languages and Cultures, says that, when the decision was being made to stop admitting applicants from Russia and Belarus, only the rector of Tallinn University spoke against it.

“Two artistic schools, the Academy of Arts and the Academy of Music and Theatre, thought an exception would be made for them, as each of their students is a rarity, but it turned out later that all must comply, and even the private Mainor Business School had to refuse the students they had already admitted,” she says.

Oskolskaya and Alexandra Milyakina from the Chair of Semiotics at the University of Tartu in March launched a petition against the decision not to admit students and doctoral students with Russian passports. The ladies say it was signed by about 2,000 people, including some Estonian professors.

“Anyway, we were criticised for having mostly Russian names on the list. Pro-rectors from the University of Tartu spoke in the media from time to time to say that the petition didn’t mean anything as it didn’t represent the university’s position,” Milyakina says. “Then they arranged a Zoom conference with pro-rectors for semiotics and philosophy specialists, and for most of its time, we were shown a presentation on cyberwarfare and lectured on how easy it is to become its target and how not very smart and intelligent university employees and students become a tool in it.

Then the petition was also scrutinized for possible links to Russian propaganda because of a bot attack on the University of Tartu’s social networks.”

As Belobrovtseva sees it, there are mixed feelings in Estonian society about the government’s decision not to admit students from Russia.

“Certainly, the decision is inappropriate, but nobody can do anything about it, and no matter what we think about it, this can’t influence the situation in any way. Our prime minister has declared officially[https://rus.postimees.ee/7504720/kallas-o-chernom-spiske-proputinskih-artistov-na-moy-vzglyad-eto-razumno] that our worldview should be black-and-white. Take, for instance, Marko Mihkelson, head of the Foreign Affairs Committee at the Estonian parliament, who doesn’t see any problem in this situation, telling me that he had met a Russian graduate of Oxford University 20 years ago, who proved to be ‘a pure Stalinist’.”

At the University of Tartu, only 218 of the roughly 13,000 students are Russians, although there were 359 of them last year, and this number had been growing steadily[https://statistika.ut.ee/ut/?inputstabel_tabel1_columns_selected=nullkeel=%22ee%22tabel_tabel1_cells_selected=%5B%5D].

“We don’t really have too many foreign students, because there are only 30 programs where people not knowing Estonian can apply,” Oskolskaya says.

Milyakina says the decision has actually affected many people, as everyone she knows in Russia is considering precisely an academic path of emigration. In her view, the Estonian authorities have decided to apply this measure to show that they do at least something and at the same time not to affect too many people.

“But this doesn’t mean that those people deserved this,” Oskolskaya says.

She admits that she did not expect Estonia to protect her and understands why it is acting this way, and yet she wants these measures to be more “merciful.”

“I’ve been speaking out against the Ukraine war for half a year, and I’ve been doing this pretty openly, too. This includes speaking in the media and at rallies, financially supporting organisations banned in Russia, and helping refugees. If I were expelled to Russia now, this would be very dangerous for me. I agree to feel responsibility [for the war], but perhaps I’d better sponsor refugees than be put in jail in Russia,” Oskolskaya says.

This policy has also affected members of Finno-Ugric ethnic groups, who live in Russia and whom Estonia has always supported actively, she says.

“Such ethnic groups as Mordva or Komi — all of them are Russian citizens, we love and study their language and culture, but they are now denied entry, and all cultural ties are banned,” Oskolskaya says emotionally, also mentioning those who have bought real estate in Estonia, which they cannot even sell[https://rus.postimees.ee/7590238/yana-toom-chto-delat-grazhdanam-rf-so-svoey-nedvizhimostyu-v-estonii] now.

That said, Oskolskaya and Milyakina also like it very much to be in Estonia.

“I don’t feel any hatred or rejection here. Particularly in Estonia, there have been periods of mutual tension between Russians and Estonians following the Soviet Union’s breakup, when, as locals say, [Russians] might’ve been kicked out of a bus. Everything has changed very much over these thirty years, and now, when an article about my story was published, there were comments like ‘Couldn’t you really make an exception? Perhaps you might grant citizenship to this person?’” Oskolskaya says. “But I understand that Estonia is a small country bordering a very big one armed with nuclear weapons. At the start of the war, everyone here, including me, was scared and everyone feared that something similar might also be started here.”

Milyakina says that, as an LGBT person, her return to Russia would be “an untoward option.” Her wife has already received an Estonian passport, but she herself has been waiting for about a year for Russia to agree to annul her citizenship.

Aimar Ventsel, professor of ethnology from the University of Tartu, a bald-headed Estonian with tattoos, has frequently visited Russia in the past, and now he stands ready to support the decision to ban Russian students from studying in Estonia.

“If you look at this as some symbolic sanction, there is a positive aspect here. This makes it understood: sorry, but your country is committing a crime. I taught at Russian colleges in Siberia and gave a couple of lectures in St. Petersburg, and I disagree that all Russian students are opposition activists. There are those who favour Putin, there are those who are opposed to him, and there are those who don’t care,” he says.

Estonia has imposed the ban “with fanfare,” while, for instance, Scandinavian countries have forbidden sending emails to Russia from university accounts or defending their doctoral theses based on materials gathered in Russia, but none of this has gained such publicity, Ventsel says (I was unable to find confirmation to this — author’s note).

“But doesn’t it matter that people come here to study and learn something new? If they study only in Russia, nobody will ever change anything there,” I point out.

“But there is a moral responsibility factor. It’s your state and it’s your president. After all, all of this has been continuing since 2014, and the Russians have elected this government themselves.”

“But what if people didn’t vote for Putin? Don’t you know that elections [in Russia] are routinely falsified? If you show a ballot with a tick against Putin, will you be allowed to study?”

“I’ve been thinking about this regularly since February. And it’s not a black-and-white situation, but how would you sort good Russians from not that good ones? I’ve seen a proposal that this could be done based on a selfie from a police van, but it’s easier to refuse them all for the time being,” the professor replies.

Asked whether he thinks that any university is interested in having talented students, including those from Russia, Ventsel replies that numerous Estonian businesspeople have voluntarily phased out cooperation with Russian companies.

“A university is also a business in some respect, which sells education and promotes itself owing to having talented employees.

A friend of my dealing with construction materials has said he won’t buy anything from Russia. And similarly, universities won’t use talents from Russia on principle,” Ventsel says.

Visas as a privilege

It seems it was Estonia, namely its Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, who started the debate[https://www.rbc.ru/politics/09/08/2022/62f21c189a794730707755aa] back in early August as to whether the European Union should stop issuing tourist visas to Russians. The Baltic countries have discontinued doing so since the second day of the war, but, at Kallas’s behest, the visa discussion came to the foreground for nearly a month even amid the war. “Stop issuing tourist visas to Russians. Visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right,” Kallas wrote on Twitter.

The result is: the Baltic countries have stopped admitting Russians with ordinary Schengen visas issued by any country since 19 September. In addition, Baltic politicians have repeatedly explained this measure as follows: let Russian citizens topple Putin at home rather than vacate at European resorts.

Marko Mihkelson, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee at the Estonian parliament, meets me at his office wearing shorts (he has a day off) and invites me to sit down where a Russian ambassador once sat.

“Is this a good comparison?” I ask him.

“No, not at all,” Mihkelson replies sombrely. He worked as a reporter of Postimees in Moscow in the 1990s, and by all appearances, he did not fall in love with the city at the time. “I am sure there are lots of people in Russia who are opposed to the war and genocide in Ukraine. However, there are lots of others who fervently support this. We see numerous videos on social media on which Russian tourists behave very inappropriately,” he says.

He approves of the idea to bar Russian tourists from entering the European Union, “because Russians should understand that the war that is ongoing will affect their personal lives, because all of them bear responsibility for it.”

The lawmaker says that nobody would put obstacles to those who need a humanitarian visa to remain free or even alive, and yet he makes this reservation:

“I’d like Russians to be as energetic and vigorous [as they are regarding Schengen visas] in trying to change something or say something against the war every day and every hour, but I don’t see any of that.”

“But they get fined and then jailed for that,” I point out to Mihkelson.

“Yes, it’s a totalitarian state, and it’s clear that it’s hard for ordinary people to do something overnight. But when Kommersant asks its readers whether they support a new offensive on Kyiv and sixty percent say yes, what does it mean? It’s pure fascism in Russia now, as [historian] Timothy Snyder describes contemporary Russia in his interview[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-5CH33pOXM] to Mikhail Zygar. This is not just some minor conflict but a war comparable to a global one. The entry ban is one of those measures that should make people think what’s going on and what kind of future they want to live in,” reiterates Mihkelson.

Yaroslav Varenik, a journalist from the Arkhangelsk-based publication 29.ru, is one of those who fell victim to the new visa policy. In the early hours of August 14, he was first subjected to a humiliating interrogation by Russian border guards (he had been searched some time before as part of an investigation of the Anti-Corruption Foundation), after which Estonian border guards barred[https://meduza.io/feature/2022/08/14/rossiyskogo-zhurnalista-yaroslava-varenika-ne-pustili-v-estoniyu-za-chas-do-v-ezda-booking-com-otmenil-ego-bron-oformlennuyu-s-rossiyskoy-bankovskoy-karty] him from entering their country, and what is more, annulled his Schengen visa.

“I disagree with the European Union’s policy,” the journalist tells me. “It’s hypocritical on the part of European politicians, because they’ve been sponsoring the Putin regime for years by buying oil and gas from it.

To shift the blame, they scapegoat activists, journalists, and actually all Russians. By doing so, they distract the attention of their own citizens.”

Mihkelson agrees with Varenik on this, saying that Estonia has long been trying to persuade its European Union fellows to stop buying oil and gas from Russia.

“It’s clear that Russia takes advantage of supplying [commodities] to Europe to attain its foreign policy goals. We realised this many years ago, but unfortunately, we weren’t heard. And lots of our friends in Europe admit now that they used to think we were simply paranoid because of the complicated history of our relations with Russia,” he says.

Varenik is sure that Baltic politicians would not attain the declared goals through imposing an entry ban, as Russians can still travel to Europe through other countries.

“And besides, a typical Russian tourist is a well-to-do person with a family, who is unlikely to risk their business or freedom by joining protests, which Europeans are seeking to prompt them to do,” Varenik said.

The authorities of the Baltic countries keep clarifying that the entry ban does not apply to those who have humanitarian visas or to opposition activists and journalists who suffer from persecutions at home. However, it is quite hard for a typical activist to receive a humanitarian visa, and many flee to Europe precisely with tourist visas. Varenik, a journalist from Arkhangelsk, was not planning to flee Russia but simply wanted to spend a weekend walking around Tallinn and “taking a closer look if I’d still have to leave.” Obviously, the annulment of his visa and the entry ban imposed on him did not make him more confident about his future.

When Estonia decided to stop admitting Russians with Estonian Schengen visas, European parliamentarian Yana Toom described[https://rus.err.ee/1608682639/jana-toom-my-vygljadim-slegka-slaboumnymi-kogda-zaprewaem-vydannye-nami-zhe-vizy] this step as “feebleminded.”

“Okay, we’re saying that Russians don’t oppose Putin resolutely enough, and if all of them are locked there, they’ll topple him. But, firstly, protest does exist in Russia, and it is quite significant, too. I have numerous friends whose children have been thrown into a police van a hundred times. And we’re telling them that they are a piece of shit because they failed to topple Putin, aren’t we? What is it? And secondly, who is saying that? Estonians, who tolerated [the Soviet] occupation for 70 years without saying a word! Dissidents [of that era in Estonia] can be counted on one hand,” Toom says, recalling that Prime Minister Kallas’s father was also a prominent Soviet official.

Historian David Vseviov assures me, however, that the Estonian authorities will eventually find out whom to issue humanitarian visas and whom not.

“You need to give asylum to those who are entitled to it. And you should stop others from travelling to Paris for luxury bags,” Vseviov says. He also mentions the reason why the Baltic countries can easily afford this ban:

“Ninety percent of Russian tourists use Estonia solely to enter the Schengen zone, that is, we have no economic profit from this but only bear a moral burden.”

Vseviov admits that nobody forced German migrants of Jewish descent to return to Berlin and topple Hitler in 1939, but he recalls that Estonians, just like opposition-minded Russians nowadays, were also hostages to the USSR.

“You can’t do anything about that. Don’t look for someone to blame elsewhere once you started this mess yourself. After February 24, nobody knows for certain what’s right and what’s wrong here. Someone is robbing someone, and shall we say that nothing will help? Something needs to be done, after all,” he says.

“Perhaps the Estonian government wants to do at least something?” I recall Vseviov’s words during my conversation with Toom.

“You can’t sanction whole nations. You can do that with respect to regimes, businesses, individuals, or companies, or even social groups, but not to all. And besides, what’s the point, considering that 76% of Russians don’t have a foreign travel passport, and half of them never leave even their province. Whom are we punishing this way?”

Toom has to give some attention to her grandchildren: the elder sister has just hit her younger brother with a plastic stick, and the latter starts crying.

“Kids, you’re barbarians. Come over here, I’ll pity you,” Yana tells the boy. “You’re a moose, not a sister! We’ll go to the spa when I finish the conversation, and if you don’t hit your brother, I’ll finish it earlier. Look, my grandson is hitting the toy horse with his stick for absolutely the same reasons,” she continues to answer my question. “He has to do something, and perhaps he even concluded with his little brain that, if he keeps whacking the toy horse with his stick, he’ll go to the spa sooner. But a politician can’t behave that way, after all. And yet this is actually how a lot of things are done in Estonia. The same happens to gas bills here. Indeed, as a result of the sanctions, the gas prices skyrocketed, and it just so happened that, having sold less gas, Putin got more money. But it’s something we don’t like to talk about because it’s very unpleasant. All of this is like some theatre of the absurd.”In defense of activists

Unlike Yaroslav Varenik, Russian activist Yevgenia Chirikova had no problems entering Estonia, as she had arrived here back in 2015.

“Crimea’s annexation came as a huge blow to me. I didn’t expect that [Russian people] would support that so enthusiastically,” Chirikova says, explaining why she decided to leave the country. “It might look naïve, but I was sure that the whole nation would stand up and win, because Russians would not accept the violation of an international convention. Then started this ugly propagandistic campaign for war, and I felt physically disgusting to be amidst all of that.”

Anyway, Chirikova attributes her decision chiefly to her desire “to develop as a civic activist.” While in Russia, she was known as the organiser of a campaign in defence of the Khimki Forest. She was later elected to the Opposition Coordination Council and founded the Activatica website[https://activatica.org/] dealing with all forms of activism in Russia and other countries.

“I saw it as my mission to help civil society, and I realised that I wouldn’t be allowed to do that if I stay in Russia. I also understood that my taxes finance the war mongering campaign, and that’s why I decided to evacuate,” Chirikova said.

She chose Estonia because “this is an ideal place to help Russian civil society,” and she keeps doing this now, as well.

“We have managed to build a large network of activists both in Europe and in Russia. My situation is the following: I am here physically, but I am still there mentally. My mornings begin with reading news from Russia, and I am always in touch with Russian activists, because I am in charge of evacuation programs. I believe this is exactly a force that will build a perfect democratic Russia of the future when the regime falls, as these people are firmly committed to democracy, and they know what it is like and why it is necessary,” she said.

Since the start of the war, Chirikova and her colleagues have been helping Russian activists and Ukrainian refugees flee to Europe via Narva.

“The Activatica web portal saw its mission as supporting civic activists all over the country, whose interests varied from renovation to environment protection, but with the start of the war, all of them have virtually forgotten about themselves and are helping Ukrainian refugees stranded in Russia. We have three shelters in different countries, and Russian activists work in all of them. It seems to me that this is really cool. We show that it’s an absolute lie that all Russians have elected the Putin regime and that all of them support it,” she says.

Chirikova sees the ban on entering Estonia with Schengen visas as an obstacle to her work, but she believes all the blame for this should rest exclusively with far-right Estonian politicians.

“In order to be liked by their rightist voters, they seek to lobby legislation barring Russians from entering Estonian territory. I know that a hundred percent of [Russian] civic activists facing criminal charges for anti-war activities at home who have been granted protection and refugee status in Europe had entered with tourist visas, because it’s virtually impossible to receive a humanitarian visa. I know that, for I tried to get it myself,” Chirikova said.

Now she has to evacuate activists to Bishkek, Almaty, and sometimes to Georgia, where some of them have been denied entry recently.

“Dozens of civic activists opposing the Putin regime are waiting for help. They have every reason to enjoy international protection. Once an ordinary activist whom nobody would defend is put in jail, anything can happen to them. These are people I am worried about most of all,” Chirikova says.

The campaign against Russians launched by right-wing Estonian politicians has even overshadowed the issue of Ukrainian refugees, she says.

“We’ve had problems with Ukrainian refugees whom Estonian border guards didn’t allow[https://rus.delfi.ee/statja/120058774/ukrainskih-bezhencev-s-desyatyu-detmi-ne-pustili-v-estoniyu-v-evrosoyuz-oni-popali-cherez-finskuyu-granicu] into the country for some reason, and those cases really deserve more attention, because the debates about the tank and visas won’t help Ukraine win, while they divide society very much. Putin’s media have already taken advantage of this to tell Russians once again that they are hated in Europe,” she says.

Chirikova proposed selling the Narva tank at an auction as a piece of art and using the money to buy a Bayraktar drone for the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

She refuses to share collective responsibility, arguing that she did all she could back in 2012, when she set up a tent[https://www.svoboda.org/a/24542518.html] on Red Square and called for dismantling the Putin regime.

“I perfectly remember how I fought the Nord Stream 2 project for eight years. Estonian politician Marianne Mikko and I urged German policymakers to decline that project, but they wouldn’t listen to us. Why should those who warned about the danger of collaboration with Putin now fully bear the blame for the fact that he still isn’t gone? And what about those who pumped money into that regime for years — shouldn’t they? I think the question of who is to blame sidetracks us and doesn’t help those Ukrainians who are dying under Putin’s bombs,” Chirikova says.

She has visited the Estonian Foreign Ministry to explain all of her reasons, after which she was assured that nobody would be deported from Estonia.

“As a matter of fact, Estonians are not that categorical at all, they’re very humane, and you can always reach a consensus with them. My seven-year experience shows that local officials have human faces, and I do believe a dialogue is possible,” Chirikova says optimistically. “Estonians should come to understand us now at some genetic level. After all, they’ve been through occupation, and the Putin regime to me is like occupation, as well.”

However, there is little hope for this, as even people like Aimar Ventsel, the progressive professor at the University of Tartu, admits that he has no firm position on visas.

“I have friends and colleagues in Russia. For instance, Russian punks who are deeply integrated into the Western punk community and often perform in Estonia, have always been opposed to Putin’s politics. I know their convictions, and therefore, I don’t think they need to be cut off from Europe, but I’ll tell you frankly that I don’t care about people whom I don’t know. Indeed, I am aware of the reason that this is a way for opposition members to come to Europe because they are in danger at home, but when I read discussions about this, I am really happy that I don’t have to decide,” Ventsel says.

It should also be noted that Ventsel has no clear position as to whether Soviet monuments should be dismantled.

“I am not really a big fan of the demolition of monuments, but the situation is so heated now that, if there were a referendum, I’d speak in favour of removing the tank, because thirty years is enough to be fed up with that stuff,” he says.Polis Narva

“For Estonians, the tank is a symbol of occupation. For many Russians, it’s certainly a symbol of liberation from Nazism. People are afraid that, once they sort out the monument problem, they’ll eventually get at us. And there is actually some point here,” Yana Toom argues.

She notes that the 100,000 Russian citizens living in Estonia are feeling extremely uncomfortable now. Estonian media call them[https://rus.delfi.ee/statja/120045014/kopytin-100-000-grazhdan-rf-mogut-byt-ugrozoy-bezopasnosti-nuzhno-produmat-politiku-naturalizacii] “a threat to national security.”

“If we are in a state of war, this means that there are 100,000 citizens of the aggressor state in Estonia. Obviously, there is some plan as to what to do to them, but nobody knows anything about it. This is why such fantasies appear,” she says.

Ethnic Russians in Estonia do not feel happy about “the visa thing,” as Toom put it.

“Not because everyone cares about Russian tourists, but because all of us have families or friends in Russia. My sister lives in Lipetsk, and to my invitation to come to me, she replied, ‘You’re not a relative to me’. The website of our embassy says that parents are relatives, but a sister is not. Russia did not let my sister travel to Estonia to attend our father’s funeral, because she was a public servant, and now that she has retired, Estonia tells her, a sixty-year-old woman with cancer, that she must topple Putin. This is kind of unpleasant,” Toom says with her unmatched sarcasm.

She reminds me that Estonians have never viewed Narva as a full-fledged part of the country.

“In the 1990s, there were attempts to hold a referendum here to set up something like the Donbas republics. This was eventually settled, but Narva was looked askance at for years. Over the past ten years or so, efforts have been made to promote the so-called integration. They established the Estonian Language House and opened the VabaLava theatre centre here. The prime minister lived, worked, jogged, and spoke to locals in Russian here for a month. But now we are back where we were,” Toom says.

In Toom’s words, this did not make a great impression on the locals, because Estonians “view integration as something similar to assimilation, where you have not only to speak but also think in Estonian.”

“But it’s actually a person’s right to speak in any language. If I pay taxes and don’t seek to be elected a parliamentarian, what’s the problem?” she wonders.

Here is how lawmaker Stalnuhhin expresses the opinion of Russian-speaking Narva residents about their treatment by Estonia.

“The Russians here don’t have any illusions anymore. We have a typical ancient Greek democracy with a parliament of sorts, where women, slaves, and those who are younger than 31 cannot make decisions. And there is also property qualification, and if you don’t have enough land or enough slaves, you have nothing to do in this parliament. Similarly, we have less than 9% of Russian-speaking voters, even though Russian speakers make up a quarter of the entire Estonian population,” Stalnuhhin says.

As Yana Toom explains to me, there are “citizens of two rates” in Estonia, and the second-rate people[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%B5%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5_(%D0%AD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F] have no right to vote in parliamentary elections. Now some wish to deprive them also of the right to vote in local elections (which they were granted as a condition of Estonia’s accession to the EU). Stalnuhhin explains this by the desire to deprive the Centre Party of power in Tallinn, where this moderate force has been in office for years “mainly owing to this excessive constituency.”

Stalnuhhin knows Estonian as a second native language. He got his degree as a teacher of Estonian for a Russian school back in 1995 and has written several Estonian language textbooks.

“The Russians in Estonia have the perception that nobody would ask us anything. They’ll do anything they want with our education, and they’ll try to do anything they want with our memory. The constitution entitles me to choose a language of education for my child, but the state says that it is going to switch everything over to the Estonian language,” Stalnuhhin says angrily.

“But if we live in a democratic country and a person pays taxes, why should some of us decide that their children should receive an education in their native language and other children in a foreign one?

Turns out that, while some call themselves democrats, they are in fact downright totalitarianists.”

The legislator insists that a person should be able to choose a language in which to receive an education.

“As a Russian language teacher, I can tell you absolutely certainly that there are people particularly inclined to learn foreign languages, there is a general mass of 70% who need to practice the language all the time so as not to forget it, and there are also 10% of monolingual people who can’t be taught a foreign language. I’ve taught about 2,500 people in this town, and I know this,” Stalnuhhin says. “By making the Estonian language obligatory for all, you simply deprive a substantial number of people of the opportunity to get a higher education and build a career.”

He insists that this is actually one of the goals of the education policy pursued in Estonia.

“The Russians must be kept down, for they are necessary only as street cleaners and bus drivers,” he says.

According to Stalnuhhin, the Estonian government has not bothered even to make proper textbooks over the past 30 years.

“Let me put it in layman’s terms. If you study the Estonian language, you’ll see that it has a special declension and conjugation system, and in order to get the right words in all forms, you have to know several forms. Only one dictionary in Estonia published since 1985 contains all those forms,” says Stalnuhhin, who compiled the “correct” dictionary himself in 2012, which has never been officially approved by the Education Ministry.

In Yana Toom’s words, the problem is that “however tiny the pool of Estonian language teachers is, they’ve dispersed it even more” lately.

“The level of knowledge of the Estonian language has declined rather than grown over the past several years. I made an inquiry with the ministry to find out that less than half of our Estonian language teachers at Russian schools are Estonian native speakers and received instruction in Estonian themselves,” she says in surprise.

Nevertheless, Estonia plans[https://bnn-news.ru/v-sleduyushhem-godu-bolshinstvo-estonskih-shkol-perejdet-na-obuchenie-tolko-na-estonskom-yazyke-267968] that the majority of schools shall switch to instruction in the Estonian language as early as in 2023.

“I’ve been telling my fellow lawmakers for twenty years: ‘You can do whatever you want, but let children and elderly people alone. Children as regards education and elderly people as regards historical memory’. But you should understand how appealing it is to a politician to make up a problem and solve it if you can’t cope with a real problem. This happens all over the world, and they’ve mastered this skill in Estonia,” Stalnuhhin concludes.

When I ask Yana Toom whether she believes Narva residents would welcome the Russian army if it suddenly invades Estonia, she flatly disagrees.

“All of us know what it’s like to be in Russia. After all, all of us have friends and relatives there. They have their own issues, and everyone who wanted to live in Russia already live there. There was quite a long period of time when real estate in Estonia was more expensive than, say, in Smolensk. Therefore, I don’t believe that, in case of Russian aggression, anyone would be happy here.”

She recalls coming to Narva at the start of the war together with Anton Alekseev, a reporter from Estonian television, to speak to locals and tell them that military aggression is a bad thing.

“You know, the room was full, but nobody tore us apart. They certainly argued with us, but it seems to me we basically managed to reach a consensus that, while Russians in Estonia do have problems and there is some discrimination here, we don’t want these problems to be resolved with bomb strikes. After all, everyone understands that, from a purely technical standpoint, you’ll have no chance to rejoice at this tiny piece of land where we are meeting now, considering the contemporary warfare methods. That’s as clear as day,” she says.Russian prospects

Igor Rosenfeld, an elderly grey-haired man with a black moustache, runs the Kripta bookshop selling Russian books in Tartu. He graduated from the Russian literature department of the University of Tartu back in the Juri Lotman times. He opened his first shop in 1998 and has been in the book business since then. He says there are about 30,000 Russian-speaking people living in Tartu, but it is mostly children’s books that sell well.

Before our conversation, he shows me three books he has written himself, one on Russian conservatism, another one, titled Third Marxism, “an attempt to formulate contemporary leftist ideology,” and also Estonia Before and After the Bronze Night. Rosenfeld is certain that military problems should not be extended to the humanitarian and educational field, but he declined to speak about this in detail until the Left Party of Estonia, in whose establishment he is involved, is registered officially.

As a Communist, he certainly is opposed to the removal of monuments.

“What does the Narva tank have to do with the military operation? The Russian government is not a Communist one, and the program of Russia’s Ukrainian campaign is in fact a whiteguard one, since it’s about a united and undivided Russia. But, for instance, they’ve also started speaking about removing the monument to Ernst Thalmann in Germany, as if Thalmann, an antifascist killed by the Nazis, were to blame for the Russian aggression. This is distorted logic,” says Rosenfeld, who maintains[https://rus.delfi.ee/statja/120055832/kommunisty-estonii-namereny-vosstat-iz-pepla-lider-partii-my-shodny-s-levym-krylom-centristskoy-partii] that “power in Ukraine belongs to radicals under whose leadership the country is behaving aggressively.”

Rosenfeld insists it was wrong “to provoke Russia with Maidan” and “cut Ukraine off it.”

“The philosophy of our right-wing radicals implies that Russia had to be countered. [Former Estonian Prime Minister] Mart Laar, for instance, published a booklet about the 20th Waffen-SS Division, was an advisor to [former Georgian President Mikheil] Saakashvili in 2008, and then dealt with the problem of Chechnya. That is, our people were in the vanguard of those who worked to weaken Russia in the 1990s. That’s why we have this situation now,” says Rosenfeld.

“But your shop hasn’t experienced any problems, even despite numerous books on Stalin present here, has it?”

“There’ve been no direct reprisals against me, and nobody has closed my shops. They let me work. After all, certain freedom of opinion does exist in Estonia, and even though there’s some censorship here, it’s not like that in the USSR,” Rosenfeld admits.

Most of Russians who have come to the Baltic countries lately are surprised at how widely the Russian language is used here. With the rare exception, you can hear Russian speech in stores, restaurants, and government institutions, and most of local websites have Russian versions.

“Estonia speaks in three languages, and this is true for both government institutions and business organisations. This is convenient to all except for a bunch of politicians who think they should highlight their efficiency before the Estonian share of their voters,” Loss says. “And if they think they can ban people from communicating in the Russian language in a snap, this is utterly naïve.”

In the view of Irina Belobrovtseva, doctor of philology, Russian schoolchildren going to Estonian schools “will retain the Russian language at the level spoken at home, and with the entire education system’s transition to the Estonian language, it’s hard to say what’s going to be left of their Russian.” However, she believes Russian will not die quickly in Estonia.

“Some five or six years ago, an Estonian children’s author was outraged to see the word ‘milk’ written in Russian on a carton, but such things still happen occasionally at the level of some hotheads. If there are Russian people who are unable to correctly understand information in Estonian, this information should also be available in Russian. Anyway, this is a matter of a couple of decades, after which our generation will become extinct,” says Belobrovtseva, who perfectly knows Estonian as well.Future for everyone

Political scientist Karmo Tuur meets me at the counter of his beer shop Gambrinus in the very heart of the old part of Tartu. The selection of craft beer in his cellar is quite impressive.

“You can see by looking at me that I’ve been a beer fan since childhood,” Tuur grins into his fluffy moustache. “When I first walked into a special beer shop in Belgium, which we didn’t have at the time, I thought I should open something similar. I did this with the only goal in mind, so that not I should bring home beer but beer should come to me itself. That’s exactly what happened.”

Tuur has run his shop, standing from time to time at the counter himself, for about ten years now. In spare time, he comments on Estonia’s foreign policy. Tuur, who speaks Russian quite well, tells me that a number of excellent private breweries have lately emerged in Russia, and his shop occasionally used to offer Russian craft, as well, but “now it’s too toxic.”

“We are currently in the city of Tartu, which Russian troops have invaded 13 times, including twice when it was purposefully razed to the ground and its people were taken away under Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great,” says Tuur.

“Do you believe there is the danger that this might happen again?”

“Such plans do exist, and the relevant agencies are thinking whom to invade to resolve Russia’s geopolitical problems. Countries like Latvia and Finland have been mentioned in this context, and the only question is when they take those plans off the shelf and put them on the table. Indeed, this danger does exist, and it’s quite realistic, too, but Moscow currently has some other things to worry about. We hope Ukraine would be able to postpone if not completely dash those projects.”

Tuur said he is sure a democratic Russia is possible in the future only if it breaks up into several states.

“There will still be people there who would moan and would like to restore the former greatness, but if they don’t win the majority and if a normal Pskov and Novgorod republic emerge, perhaps the imperial sentiment would vanish for some time. I have a friend, a professor, who has analysed all states in world history, calculated a breakup formula, and, applying it to Russia, got 2052.”

While the beer-loving political scientist is waiting for this date to come, lawmaker Mihkelson looks forward to a replay of the Nuremberg Trials — and of course, he expects this would happen sooner than that date.

“In the past hundred years, not a single hangman has been convicted, not a single decision to commit genocide or mass killings has been ruled a crime in Russia. And this is the main problem for Russia’s future. If you don’t address this, unfortunately, you can’t get out of this hole where the security men have driven Russia. It’s precisely this war that is a great chance for Russia to do that,” he says.

The Alexander Nevsky Cathedral is located right in front of the Estonian parliament building in Tallinn. Built in 1900, it is a vivid symbol of the Russian empire, which owned these lands starting from the 18th century. Mihkelson assures me that, unlike the Soviet tank monument, Estonia will not demolish this cathedral. However, the attitude toward the Soviet period in Estonia’s history still divides the Estonians and Russians living here.

Mihkelson insists that, after February 24, there can be no discussions on Soviet legacy, and all key monuments to Soviet occupation would be removed by the end of the year. Mihkelson’s fellow-parliamentarian Stalnuhhin says, when asked what he thinks about recognising the Soviet period as occupation:

“If I say yes, this would set me against my voters who don’t think so. If I say no, this would set the party against Estonian voters who think that there was occupation. Whenever Estonian journalists ask me such questions, I always answer this: ‘You’d better agree that Estonians were collaborationists, for how could it be that there was occupation but no collaborationism? Do you really mean all Estonians were forest brothers[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_war_in_the_Baltic_states]?”

Stalnuhhin says that, after the tank’s demolition, he has felt as if having been treated as an invader.

“I was born here, my mom was born here, and my grandma and grandpa were born here, too. You’re speaking of events that ended 30 years ago. Isn’t it enough to build a country anew? How long are they going to harp upon that? Show me a living invader who crossed the border in 1944 and is still holding some office. What are you talking about?”

“About memory! That’s what you like to talk about, isn’t it?”

“Was there occupation in the 18th century as well? Then you should tear down the monuments left from Peter the Great, like, for instance, the Kadriorg [Palace].”

“Well, they’ve torn down monuments to Columbus in America,” I note.

“This isn’t a good example for me. All of them are crazy morons there, and I don’t even want to talk about BLM. In Estonia, they’re fighting those who fought the Nazis. About 200,000 soldiers on the one side and 40,000 on the other died near Narva. Soil is soaked in blood here, and now they’re removing monuments. And who is doing that? Fighters of Nazis, really? Or maybe Nazis themselves?”

As Loss puts it, “it’s no good endlessly using the awful word ‘occupation’ to vindicate the authorities’ not very skilful actions toward the Russian-speaking population.”

Then the former Russian Theatre art director utters something like nearly a policy speech.

“Nothing should be justified by what happened yesterday. You should think about what happens today, or better about what’s going to happen tomorrow. I don’t like the extremes, I don’t like hatred. In the current political situation, the worst thing for me is the rupture of ties and trust between people, which have been developing for decades. I understand that I, as well as other people from the theatrical community, will have later to restore empathy, respect for another person’s standpoint, and the understanding that the world and people in it are very different. Everyone has their own truth, and everyone has their own pain. These are things that look obvious, but they are dismissed so easily when something causing fear comes. People can’t be blamed for being afraid of Russian invasion, and when I say that Estonian politicians act stupidly, I understand that their actions are prompted by fear. But fear is an ill adviser.”

ESTONIA: FOREIGN MINISTRY SANCTIONS PLAN TO COST FIRMS UP TO A BILLION EUROS

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has proposed sanctions on the Russian Federation's state rail company, Russian Railways (RZhD), which could harm Estonian and Baltic States' freight rail operators in the process, depriving them of up to a billion euros in rolling stock, cargo and other assets once they were effectively trapped over the border in Russia, daily Eesti Paevaleht (EPL) reports.

EPL wrote on September 27 that: "Estonian transit companies and the rail sector received confirmation a week ago that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent a proposal to Brussels for discussion, which would impose sanctions on Russian Railways, after which all economic cooperation with this company would end."

"Impact assessments are still being requested from the rail companies. Finland and Estonia would mainly suffer as a result of the policy. However, Russia could obtain for itself close to a billion euros of the assets of Estonian companies, if their wagons get stuck behind the border," the piece added.

The ministry declined to confirm to EPL whether sanctions were in fact under preparation, and had not provided substantive answer to the Estonian companies' fears, EPL reported.

The ministry has also not commented on whether the proposal has contingencies whereby the desired sanction would still weaken Russia, but not harm Estonia's own companies.

The plan has met with a sharp criticism from representatives of the sector, EPL continued, with Andres Valgerist, board chair of the logistics and transit association (Logistika- ja transiidiassotsiatsioon) stating that: "Essentially, the assets of Estonian entrepreneurs, worth nearly a billion euros, will be handed over to Russia and help to increase Russia's influence and income in Central Asia."

The proposal "seems like subversion against our country, while aiding Russia," he went on.

Skinest Rail owner Oleg Ossinovski said: "I hope that the Estonian authorities will check whether the author of this proposal is a run-of-the-mill "useful idiot for the Kremlin", of whom there are many in Europe, or whether this represents is something more serious."

Skinest is the largest private railway company in the Baltic States, with over 8,000 wagons in its fleet.

In a separate editorial, EPL itself essentially supported the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' sanctions plan, stating that war meant not doing business with an enemy.

The sanctions would form part of broader proposals to the EU to impose further rounds of sanctions on Russia in the wake of its ongoing war in Ukraine. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

Formin: Estonia to give up Russian gas from Jan 1 (expands)

TALLINN, Sep 29, BNS – The Estonian government has taken a decision to impose a legally binding national sanction on Russian gas from Jan. 1, Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu said at the government's press conference on Thursday. 

Reinsalu noted that the political will to give up Russian gas was expressed by the previous government already this spring, but now it was set out as a legally binding measure.

According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the sanction will affect first and foremost Estonian gas companies whose authorizations entitle them to import natural gas or provide transmission services. According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, there are nine companies with valid authorizations to import gas and one company with an authorization to provide transmission services.

The measure will not bring any change to the supply of gas for household consumers, since almost no natural gas has been delivered to Estonia from Russia since April 2022.

Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure Riina Sikkut said the sanction does not affect the security of Estonia's gas supply.

"We have taken a number of important steps to ensure the availability of gas when Russian imports cease, such as building LNG terminal reception capacity and increasing transmission capacity at existing interconnection points. To further mitigate the risk, we have established a state strategic gas reserve at the Estonian Stockpiling Agency, and Elering has also taken care of a reserve for protected consumers," Sikkut said.

The sanction enters into force on Dec. 31.

Reinsalu said at the government's press conference that the European Commission has also proposed a package of new sanctions on Russia.

"It provides for export bans on certain goods, as well as import bans, the extension of prohibitions on the provision of services, their extension to the so-called 'people's republics' of Donetsk and Luhansk, the extension of the sanctions also to the so-called civilian governments of the occupation authorities of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions," the minister explained.

In addition, the Commission made a proposal in principle for the European Union to enforce the oil price cap agreed by the G7.

TALLINN. Sept 29 (Interfax) - The Estonian government at a meeting on Thursday decided to impose from January 1 mandatory national sanctions on Russian gas, Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu told reporters.

"The government expressed its political will to discontinue the use of Russian gas in spring, but now it has been envisaged as a legally binding measure. Estonia is introducing a legally binding national sanction on Russian gas from January 1 or before the end of this year," Reinsalu said.

The European Commission has suggested a new package of anti-Russian sanctions that envisages a ban on the export of some goods and a ban on the import of certain goods and services and applies these sanctions to the regions of Ukraine where referendums on their accession to Russia have been held, he said.

ESTONIA: NATURAL GAS IMPORTS AND PURCHASES FROM RUSSIA BANNED

Estonia's government on September 29 adopted a sanction that banned the importing and buying of natural gas from Russia. It will be valid from December 31.

The ban also applies to providing associated transmission services, importing liquefied natural gas and buying with the aim of entering it into the transmission and distribution systems.

No other restrictions apply to the purchase and import of liquefied gas.

The sanction was imposed as a foreign policy measure, as in Lithuania and Latvia, Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu (Isama) said.

"The aim of the sanction is to pressure Russia into ending its military aggression against Ukraine, as natural gas is an important source of income for Russia and it is used as a lever against the European Union," Reinsalu said.

He added that as early as April 7, the Estonian government decided, in principle, that Estonia would no longer use Russian gas.

The sanction mainly affects entrepreneurs whose license gives them the right to import natural gas or provide transmission services. According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, there are nine companies with valid gas import licenses, and one company with a license for providing transmission services.

The measure does not affect the supplies of household customers, as, since April, virtually no natural gas has been imported from Russia to Estonia.

Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure Riina Sikkut (SDE) said the sanction would not affect Estonia's gas supply security.

"We have taken several important steps to ensure sufficient gas supplies when imports from Russia end. For example, we have established the LNG terminal surge capacity and increased transmission capacities in existing interconnection points. For additional risk management, we have created national strategic gas reserves at the Estonian Stockpiling Agency, and Elering has a guaranteed reserve for consumers," Sikkut noted.

Estonian paper supports proposal to sanction Russian Railways

The following is the text of an unattributed editorial entitled "This is war. One does not do business with the enemy" and published by the daily newspaper Eesti Paevaleht on 27 September:

"Capitalists are selling to us the rope with which we will hang them."

This quote that has been attributed to Lenin in various forms, summarises well the essence of the current war against Ukraine.

Today's Delfi Arileht [business section of the pan-Baltic news website Delfi] writes that the proposals by Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu [conservative Isamaa party] would foresee imposing sanctions on Russian Railways and ending any kind of economic activity with it. It is unclear what the rest of the European Union would think about this proposal, but in Estonian business circles the punishment of Russian Railways has caused a notable storm. "I hope that Estonian authorities check whether the author of this idea is a usual so-called useful idiot of the Kremlin, whom there are many in Europe, or whether this is more serious," Oleg Ossinovski, owner of the Skinest company with a fleet of over 8,000 carriages asserts.

This is very disappointing. In principle, if sanctions were imposed, it would be no surprise if Russia would simply requisite the carriage fleet of Estonian companies. Total damage could potentially extend to one billion euros. Also, an important information system could fall into the hands of Russia and this would also endanger shipments in the Baltic states.

But complaints that it would perhaps be impossible to conduct business with Russia, appear exceptionally cynical. Imagine if McDonalds had announced that they were sorry for Ukrainians, but that Russians were used to giving them their money for burgers (and they were used to taking it).

Big business with carriages of course belongs to a rather higher category. Just like the fuel industry, about which we have written, some companies are squeezing from Russia the last promised drop of oil. And paying for it.

Reinsalu is doing the right thing here, but not the entrepreneurs. The latter do not understand or refuse to understand that by feeding the neighbour's war machine they are threatening the same security environment that allows them to survive in the first place (and as a bonus, maintain one's property in line with the rule of law). Rather they should have begun thinking since 24 February how to pull out from Russia.

This plan has loose ends, of course. At the same time both Latvia and Lithuania should be pressurised to ensure that they would not take advantage of the Belarusian "opening". And since sanctions are a societal decision, one cannot presume that a few companies would bear their burden alone. Hence some kind of a compensation should be ready from the shared purse.

But this is still war. And one does not do business with an enemy in wartime.

'Putin's £100million superyacht Graceful is renamed Killer Whale and spotted off the coast of Estonia escorted by armed Russian Coast Guard vessel'

* Vladimir Putin's second-largest superyacht spotted near Estonia going to Russia

* The 267-foot, £100m Graceful now renamed Kosatka - Russian for 'killer whale'

* It was spotted being escorted by armed Russian Coast Guard vessel, Forbes say

* It had previously escaped Germany two weeks before invasion of Ukraine

* Putin and his oligarchs have been desperate to stop their property being seized

Vladimir Putin's second-largest superyacht, valued at £100million, has escaped sanctions and was recently spotted off the coast of Estonia under a new name, according to a report.

The dictator's plaything, the 267-foot Graceful, is now sailing under the name of Kosatka (Russian for 'killer whale'), according to Forbes[https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2022/10/04/vladimir-putins-superyacht-graceful-has-a-new-name-killer-whale/?sh=4d0e964226fd], who claim Carl Groll, a contributing photographer for TheYachtPhoto.com photographed it on September 25.

The pictures show Kosatka travelling north through the Baltic Sea under the watchful eye of a Russian coastguard vessel, thought to be en route to Putin's home town of St Petersburg.

The superyacht had beat a hasty retreat out of Germany for the Russian exclave at the onset of war, just as Western governments were threatening to embark on a seizing spree of oligarchs' property should Putin invade Ukraine.

Reports from German newspaper Bild[https://www.bild.de/bild-plus/politik/ausland/politik-ausland/aus-angst-vor-festsetzung-hier-fluechtet-die-putin-jacht-aus-hamburg-79076658,view=conversionToLogin.bild.html] suggested the superyacht had escaped before repairs could even be finished.

They referenced UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who had told Putin and his allies they would 'have nowhere to hide' if Russia invades Kiev.

The ship's movements and the time of its name change are unclear as its transponder has been switched off since at least August 30, according to hip tracking service MarineTraffic, when it was still in Kaliningrad.

Kosatka - then named Graceful - bade a swift adieu to the port of Hamburg on February 7, two and a half weeks before Putin gave the order to invade Ukraine, apparently bound for Russia.

It had undergone a five month refit at the shipyards of Blohm+Voss, the company that originally built the yacht in 2014.

Western governments did not sanction the ship until the US government hit it and three other yachts linked to Putin on June 2.

Featuring stunning and finely furnished interiors, a spiral staircase and a swimming pool the £73.2 million pleasure craft was originally built by Sevmash in Russia - with interiors and exteriors envisioned by H2 Yacht Design.

The interiors include glossy sleek surfaces, soft cushioned sofas and deck chairs, and a posh white marble-styled bathroom.

What appears to be an office room contains multitudes of shelves for books and a desk fronted with a stunning painting of a sailing boat.

Exercise equipment can also be seen out on the deck, which is also lined with lounge-style seating and barstools.

Putin's largest superyacht, the luxurious £500million, 460ft-long Scheherazade - reportedly given as a Christmas gift by a group of fawning oligarchs in 2014 - was impounded in Italy in May.

The existence of the super yacht was revealed in March, with its captain named as Briton Guy Bennett-Pierce, but the crew mostly staffed by Russian secret service officers.

Now, new revelations indicate the floating palace is nominally owned by Eduard Khudainatov, former president of Rosneft, and an old KGB ally of Igor Sechin.

But Khudainatov 'is a front man for Putin and his entourage', said a report from Dossier Centre.

In May, Italian police finally served paperwork to the yacht's captain, telling him it would be unable to set sail from the dry dock where it is undergoing a multi-million-pound refit.

A statement from the Italian Financial Police said in May: 'After verification by the fiscal authorities it has come to light that there is a significant economic connection between the owner of The Scheherazade and senior elements of the Russian government.

'On the basis of these elements it has been recommended that the yacht be placed on the current European Union sanctions list and the Minister of Finance in Rome has agreed.'

ESTONIA: NARVA BUSINESSES CONCERNED BY RUSSIAN COUNTER-SANCTION CARGO TRANSPORT BAN

Businesses in the Estonian border town Narva are concerned about impending Russian counter-sanctions, which will ban the transport of cargo from 30 countries.

From October 10, Russia will implement a ban on two-way transportation, transit and transportation from or to a third country.

Countries that have applied sanctions on Russian after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine will be affected. This includes the EU, UK, Norway and Ukraine.

The new rules are likely to have a significant impact on Estonian businesses, especially those in eastern Estonia.

Nikolai Burdakov, head of Narva Auto, the largest transportation company in Narva, has no doubt that it will. The company employs 50 people.

"Almost 100% of our work is freight transport between Europe and Russia. That is why the new bans will make our work more difficult," Burdakov said, adding new rules had not been clarified yet.

The restrictions will allow certain goods to be unloaded and reloaded in the border zone. The ban will not apply to food and medicine.

The company must now look for partners in Russia who can be trusted to deliver their goods to customers.

Another counter-sanction, restriction on the export of diesel fuel from Russia, also causes concern.

"When we leave Russia, we can take only 200 liters of fuel. This is enough for about 200 or 300 kilometers, which is why we have to refuel with more expensive fuel. So we are less competitive than other carriers," Burdakov said.

Trucks from European countries must leave Russia until October 17 and the ban is valid until the end of the year. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

Europe’s new ‘Iron Lady’ Kaja Kallas says the West mustn’t negotiate with Putin

Estonia's PM, who calls Margaret Thatcher ‘an inspiration’, has also told Russians fleeing his draft they cannot seek asylum in her country

Kaja Kallas’s mother was just six months old when Soviet Union guards loaded her onto a cattle car and deported her to a prison camp in Siberia. She would not return home to Estonia until she was ten years old.

Today, her daughter is the prime minister of Estonia[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/06/11/europe-must-ensure-kremlins-war-ukraine-fails-worse-will-follow/] and Europe’s strongest voice against any appeasement of Vladimir Putin, who she calls a “terrorist” and a “criminal” who must face justice for war crimes in international courts.

Estonia was the first country to congratulate Ukraine on the destruction of a key bridge[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/10/08/crimea-bridge-vladimir-putin-russia-ukraine-kerch-strait-explosion/] linking Russian and the annexed region of Crimea on Saturday and did so even though Kyiv had not claimed responsibility for the strike.

“Ukraine must win this war,” Ms Kallas told The Telegraph in Prague, Czech Republic during a European summit where she renewed her demands for more sanctions on Moscow and more weapons for Kyiv

No other country in the world has sent more military equipment to Ukraine as a proportion of GDP per capita than Estonia – a small Baltic nation of just 1.3m people, that borders Russia and only emerged from behind the Iron Curtain to independence in 1991.

Estonia was also one of the few nations to send arms to Kyiv[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/06/04/estonian-government-collapses-amid-fears-russian-security-threat/] before Putin’s illegal invasion on February 24.

It is for good reason that Estonia’s first female prime minister, who calls cold warrior Margaret Thatcher “an inspiration”, has been dubbed Europe’s new “iron lady”.

She has warned Russians fleeing Putin’s draft[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/09/27/vladimir-putins-propagandists-slam-mobilisation-drive/] in Ukraine that Estonia will reject their claims for asylum. Instead, they should stay home and topple their president, she says.

She wants the EU to ban Russian tourists and Ukraine to be given Nato membership[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/03/15/ukraine-will-never-able-join-nato-concedes-volodymyr-zelensky/]. She is ploughing investment into Estonia’s army and for more weapons for Kyiv.

Ms Kallas, a 45-year-old mother of three, stood out in her blue dress among the gathering of 44 of Europe’s, mostly male, biggest political beasts for the first-ever European Political Community meeting in Prague on Thursday.

“Russia is terrorising us so that we will back away from our decisions,” she said, referring to Putin’s threats of nuclear war[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/10/07/ukraine-news-latest-advances-war-russia-nuclear-putin/].

“When it comes to Putin then, of course he is a war criminal and must be prosecuted for the crimes of aggression he has committed,” she said in the immaculate gardens of Prague Castle during a break in the talks.

“And you shouldn't be negotiating with terrorists because it pays off for them. We will pay a higher price in the long term.”

Ms Kallas had criticised France and Germany for pressing for an early peace deal[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/05/25/ukraine-can-avoid-bad-peace-has-upper-hand-putin-estonia-warns/] earlier in the conflict.

She admits she is still “worried” that Ukraine could be pushed into “some premature peace that they are not really ready to go into” by Western allies.

The West had a “very different understanding” of what peace can mean to the former Iron Curtain countries[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/06/30/ukraine-news-russia-war-nato-summit-madrid-finland-sweden/], she said.

“For half of Europe, the end of the Second World War meant peace, meant prosperity,” she said, “On the other side of Europe, peace meant atrocities, torture and mass deportations.”

As of August, Estonia has sent €250 million (£220 million) in military aid, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, howitzers, anti-tank mines, grenade launchers, ammunition and vehicles to Kyiv.

Ms Kallas said: “It is clear that Ukraine is dependent on our help. We are here in a small country of 1.3 million[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/10/08/country-where-25pc-inflation-low-price-pay-see-russia/] and looking to our warehouses-what more can we send?

“I believe that the bigger countries, that have much bigger warehouses, can also find something that they can give because the only way to stop this war is for Ukraine to win.”

“The dictator only understands strength,” she said, “These are the lessons we have learned from our history and what we are seeing unfolding right now.”

Ms Kallas – whose first name means “echo” – is keenly aware of Estonia’s painful past of Russian oppression which lasted until 1991 after it was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.

The Soviet Union ordered two mass deportations in 1941 and 1949 when Ms Kallas’ mother Kristi was deported with her mother and grandparents. At the same time, Russians were imported to Estonia.

In 1922, the Russian percentage of the population in Estonia was 2.6 per cent. By the end of the occupation in 1991, it was more than 30 per cent.

“Every family in Estonia has a similar history,” Ms Kallas said. “The only unique thing about this story is that all my family members actually survived and were returned to Estonia.”

Ms Kallas has told Russia’s fleeing conscripts not to come to Estonia in case any increase in the Russian population gives Putin a pretext to invade, despite France and Germany arguing the EU should not rule out giving them refuge.

She said each individual application would be assessed but added, "mobilisation as such is not the basis for granting asylum.” She urged those fleeing the draft to stay in Russia and fight Putin and has warned they could be a security risk.

The Russian community in Estonia was mostly “with us”. “They see how much worse life is on the Russian side,” she said.

“They also understand very well that if Russia comes to ‘liberate’ Estonia, their homes are the first ones to be erased or destroyed.”

Ms Kallas was 11 years old when her father Siim took her to East Berlin and the Brandenburg Gate in 1988, a year before the fall of the Berlin Wall.

“My dad told me, ‘breathe it in deeply, that’s the air of freedom that comes from the other side’,” she said.

Three years after the trip to Berlin, Estonia declared independence for the second time.

Siim, a member of the Supreme Council of the Soviet Union, would later become the 14th prime minister of Estonia and later a European Commission vice-president.

Siim founded the liberal and free market Estonian Reform Party which his daughter, who speaks fluent English, Russian and French, now leads.

“I was born under Soviet occupation. I remember the Soviet times. I was a generation that was living without freedom. So I am not taking it for granted and I understand its value,” Ms Kallas said.

She added “Russians haven’t changed their ways. The same playbook that they had here in Estonia in the 1940s, they are playing in Ukraine. No country, no nation, not any people should go through that.”

Ms Kallas spearheads a coalition of EU members, including the Baltic nations, Poland and now Ireland, urging the West not to give an inch to the despot in Moscow.

The EU hit Russia with unprecedented economic sanctions after the invasion of Ukraine but the latest tranche, rubber-stamped in Prague, was more difficult to agree on, with countries demanding carve-outs and exceptions from the measures.

Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, rails against the “economic self-harm” of the sanctions, while elections in Italy in September have brought two Putin apologists in Silvio Berlusconi and Matteo Salvini close to power in Georgia Meloni’s expected coalition.

Ms Kallas blames “the fatigue of the war” and “domestic problems kicking in” for making it “harder and harder to keep the unity” over sanctions.

“It's becoming more and more difficult to put the sanctions in place, And there are not many elements left that we can sanction. That’s the problem,” she said.

Ms Kallas became Estonia’s first female prime minister in January 2021, part of a wave of electoral successes that returned female leaders in Finland, Norway, Denmark, Lithuania and Iceland.

“In politics, they ask about your gender all the time, but this does not define me when I talk about the issues that I talk about,” she said pointing out her success as a lawyer was because she was good, not because she was a woman.

But, when asked about the gender balance at the European Political Community, she added, “I counted. Out of 44 leaders, only eight were women. That is not so much.”

Ms Kallas was seated next to Liz Truss at the three-course summit dinner of seabass, venison backstrap with a confit of calves’ shank, meringue and ice cream, washed down with a Czech chardonnay and a 2019 vintage Frankovka red wine.

“I think we have similar views; that the only way to end this is that Ukraine wins and Russia is pushed back to its borders,” she said.

Must Putin fall for there to be peace in Europe?

“It is up to people in Russia to really put the pressure on and say whether he falls or not,” she said.

1,700 British soldiers are deployed in Estonia, where they lead the Nato defence of the country[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/02/21/estonia-urges-nato-send-troops-eastern-europe-send-strong-message/].

But there is disquiet in Tallinn that a temporary doubling of troops, agreed earlier in the Ukraine conflict, is now being allowed to lapse by Britain.

“It gives a very, very bad message to our population,” said Ms Kallas, who brought the issue up with the Prime Minister.

Estonia is boosting defence spending to four per cent of its GDP. While it is not dependent on Russian energy, the country is facing huge inflation because of the war.

“The majority of people understand that inflation is like a war tax. So we pay this in euros whereas the Ukrainians are paying in human lives,” she said.

Ms Kallas’ transformation from the schoolgirl looking from East to West to stateswoman, is mirrored in her country’s 2004 transformation from Soviet satellite to EU and Nato member state.

She studied law because no one else in her family did. At the time the young nation was “like a start-up”, she said.

“We built our country from scratch, and I was very young, doing extremely interesting big privatisation projects which people in their forties could only dream about elsewhere in Europe.”

In 2002, she married for the first time and had a son but divorced in 2014. She returned to Tallinn in 2018 after four years as a member of the European Parliament in Brussels to successfully run for the leadership of the Reform Party. The same year she married Arvo Hallik, a venture capitalist, who has two children from a previous marriage.

They now have a “blended” family, which she juggles with her demanding work life with occasionally mixed results with the prime minister recently returning home exhausted to find a kitchen “full of dirty dishes”.

She laughed, “I asked the teenagers why they hadn’t unloaded the dishwasher. ‘Yeah, we don’t have time’,” they said.

She never planned to become prime minister. “You have ideas that you support and you think that should be done in the society and you fight for them. But it's not because of the position really,” she said.

In August, Estonia repelled the largest cyber attack by its belligerent neighbour since 2007.

But Ms Kallas insists Estonia would be in Putin’s firing line even if she was “quiet” about Ukraine.

“After Ukraine, he has eyes on Moldova. He has eyes on Georgia, he has eyes on the Baltic states. He has been very open about this. The only way to stop this is to help Ukraine win this war.”

“Volodymyr Zelensky is a wartime leader,” she said. “In a sense, we are all in this war but I hope I don't have to be a real wartime leader like him.”

The Russians have not changed their ways, warns the Estonian leader, raised under Soviet tyranny

Kaja Kallas's mother was just six months old when Soviet Union guards loaded her on to a cattle car and deported her to a prison camp in Siberia. She would not return home to Estonia until she was 10 years old.

Today, her daughter is the prime minister of Estonia and Europe's strongest voice against any appeasement of Vladimir Putin, who she calls a "terrorist" and a "criminal" who must face justice for war crimes in international courts.

TALLINN. Sept 29 (Interfax) - The Estonian government at a meeting on Thursday decided to impose from January 1 mandatory national sanctions on Russian gas, Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu told reporters.

"The government expressed its political will to discontinue the use of Russian gas in spring, but now it has been envisaged as a legally binding measure. Estonia is introducing a legally binding national sanction on Russian gas from January 1 or before the end of this year," Reinsalu said.

The European Commission has suggested a new package of anti-Russian sanctions that envisages a ban on the export of some goods and a ban on the import of certain goods and services and applies these sanctions to the regions of Ukraine where referendums on their accession to Russia have been held, he said.

During war in Ukraine, financial sanctions have been applied in Estonia on 763 occasions

TALLINN, Oct 12, BNS – By the end of September, 763 notices of the application of a sanction or suspicion of such a situation had been submitted to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of Estonia.

On the basis of the European Union sanctions against Russia, some 20.8 million euros have been frozen in Estonia to date.

More than half of the notices of the application of an international financial sanction were submitted by credit institutions. According to the law, the sanction must be applied and reported by all natural and legal persons in Estonia, including private entrepreneurs, lawyers, notaries, and registrars, the FIU said on Wednesday.

"Half a year ago, when the war in Ukraine had lasted for one month, financial sanctions concerning a total of nearly 1.7 million euros had been legally applied. As of today, nearly 20.8 million euros is frozen, excluding receivables and revenue forgone. The increase in frozen assets is due to the addition of an oligarch to the sanction list and the identification of additional economic resources in the case of a person already on the list. The economic resources of the companies linked to these two oligarchs now account for 95 percent of all frozen assets," Matis Maeker, head of the FIU, said in a press release.

Maeker noted that the list of persons subject to sanctions is established by the European Union.

"The statistics on frozen economic resources consists of transactions that have been notified to the FIU. When publishing statistics, it must be assessed whether the frozen economic resources, mainly transactions, are still subject to detention or must be released due to changed ownership or control relationships," the head of the FIU said, adding that, therefore, the companies listed in these statistics as subject to financial sanctions are presented strictly as of this very moment. 

Based on the EU regulations and the lists of subjects of sanctions, the assets of the following companies related to Viatcheslav Kantor are restricted in Estonia: DBT AS, Capco Holdings Ltd, Rainbee Holdings Ltd, Baltic Cargo Survey OU, Opansa Enterprises Ltd, Seatrader Agency OU, Acron Switzerland AG, North Atlantic Potash Inc, Balttrans LLC. Of the companies related to Andrey Melnichenko, restrictions apply to the assets of Eurochem Trading GMBH, Eurochem Group AG, Eurochem Terminal Sillamae OU and Eurochem Antwerpen.

"For companies linked to both subjects of sanctions, the FIU has issued exemptions to ensure the safe handling of chemicals and thus the safety of people and the environment, and we will continue to review the applications received," Maeker said.

Other persons on the EU sanctions list, the assets of companies related to whom have been frozen are Alexey Mordaschov, who is associated with TT Baltics SIA and Severstal Distribution SIA, and Alexey Nechayev, who is associated with Faberlic Europe sp. Z o.o. and Faberlic Baltija SIA. In addition, the funds of Promsvyazbank and VTB Bank have been frozen.

Since 2014, the European Union has imposed restrictive measures against 1,236 persons and 115 entities that have directly or indirectly undermined Ukraine's sovereignty or territorial integrity.

Estonian court jails Belarusian citizen who attempted to transport goods to Russia

TALLINN, Oct 13, BNS – The Tartu County Court handed a two-month jail sentence to a citizen of Belarus, who, using forged documents, attempted to transport goods banned due to sanctions to Russia via Estonia by truck.

The court found Belarusian citizen Pyotr Rafalovich guilty of attempting to violate an international sanction and using a forged document and sentenced him to a total of two months in prison. The man's sentence will be calculated from his detention on Aug. 23. As an additional punishment, the court decided to expel Rafalovich from Estonia and banned him from entering the country for five years.

According to the charges, Rafalovich, who arrived at a customs point with a truck on Aug. 23, presented documents to the Estonian customs officer about the goods in the truck, according to which he was transporting filler for 3D printers and various technical devices from the company Siemens. Among them was an electromagnetic positioner.

The man submitted fake documents for the goods, according to which he was seemingly transporting the goods to Armenia, but according to the correct documents, it turned out that the goods were intended to be taken to Russia.

Rafalovich violated the prohibition laid down in the regulation of the Council of the European Union, which deals with restrictive measures related to the activities of Russia. The regulation of the Council of the European Union prohibits the sale, delivery, transfer or export of goods to Russia that can help to increase Russia's industrial capacity in particular.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced a wave of Russian drone attacks and strongly urged the country’s allies to provide it with air defense weapons.

“To guarantee the protection of our skies and reduce the possibilities for Russian terrorists to zero, we need much more air defense systems and more missiles for those systems,” he said in a televised address to the nation late Monday. “This is not only in Ukraine’s interests. The less opportunities for terror Russia has, the sooner this war ends.”

Explosives-laden suicide drones have struck Ukraine’s capital, setting buildings ablaze and tearing a hole in one of them. Authorities said four people died.

“Russia doesn’t have any chance on the battlefield, and it tries to compensate for its military defeats with terror,” Zelesnkyy said. “Why this terror? To put pressure on us, on Europe, on the entire world.”

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS:

MOSCOW — Russia and Ukraine also completed a prisoner swap Monday, according to Denis Pushilin, head of Ukraine’s breakaway region of Donetsk that was annexed illegally by Russia.

Denis Pushilin said Monday that each side was supposed to release 110 prisoners but his side handed over only 108 Ukrainian prisoners — all women — because two said they wanted to stay in Russia. He said Ukraine released 110 prisoners.

The Russian Defense Ministry said those 110 Russian citizens included 72 seamen from commercial vessels who had been held since February. It said the Russian side handed over 108 Ukrainian servicewomen.

The head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Andriy Yermak, posted photos and a video of a large group of women on Telegram on Monday, saying it was “the first all-female exchange” for Ukraine. According to Yermak, servicewomen and civilians were among those released; some of them had been captured by Russian-backed separatists in the east of Ukraine long before Russia’s full-scale invasion in February.

“Now all the girls will undergo a medical examination and rehabilitation. They will hug their relatives, their children, recover,” Yermak wrote, adding: “Ukraine will not leave anyone behind.”

BRUSSELS — The European Union’s top diplomat says the bloc is gathering evidence about Iran’s alleged sale of drones to Russia and will respond if the allegations prove true.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Monday, “We are following very closely this use of drones. We are gathering evidence and we will be ready to react with the tools at our disposal.”

Borrell spoke after chairing a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg, where the bloc decided to slap sanctions on Iranian officials deemed responsible for the crackdown on anti-government protesters.

Borrell says that Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba denounced the use of drones in a speech to the ministers via video-link from a bomb shelter. Borrell did not say what kind of measures the EU would consider.

KYIV, Ukraine — A top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is blaming Iran for the death of Ukrainians in Russian drone strikes.

Mikhailo Podolyak also warned that sanctions may not be enough to deter Tehran from supplying Moscow’s forces with the deadly suicide drones that killed at least four civilians in Kyiv on Monday.

“A country that oppresses its own people is now giving (Russian) monsters weapons for mass murders in the heart of Europe,” Mikhailo Podolyak tweeted.

He said there could be no “concessions to totalitarianism.”

Podolyak also called for the Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations to expel Russia from the organization.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s foreign minister wants the European Union to sanction Iran for providing Russia with the suicide drones that killed at least four civilians in Kyiv on Monday.

The Iranian-made drones have been used elsewhere in Ukraine in recent weeks against urban centers and infrastructure, including power stations.

They are comparatively cheap, costing in the region of $20,000. Their use in swarms presents a challenge to Ukrainian air defenses.

Dmytro Kuleba said on his social media accounts that the next EU sanctions package on Russia “must be strong” and again requested more air defense systems and ammunition for Ukraine.

Speaking in a video statement posted on Facebook, Kuleba said he became the first minister to participate in Monday’s call with the EU foreign ministers from a bomb shelter.

He said he told his EU colleagues that the attacks on Ukraine’s energy facilities amounted to a blow to European energy security, as they derailed Ukrainian energy exports to the EU.

___

BRUSSELS — The European Union has approved a military training program in Europe for thousands of Ukrainian troops.

The 27-nation bloc also gave the go-ahead Monday to another 500 million euros ($486 million) in funds to help supply weapons and other military support to Ukraine.

The aim is to train almost 15,000 Ukrainian troops, chiefly in Poland and Germany.

It’s hoped the mission, which will initially run for two years, can begin in mid-November.

The new tranche of money brings to just over 3 billion euros ($2.9 billion) the total EU sum in security support available for Ukraine.

___

TALLINN, Estonia — Belarus is to host a total of 9,000 Russian troops and 170 tanks as part of a new joint Russian-Belarusian military force.

That’s according to Belarusian defense ministry officials Monday.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced the formation of the new force last week. He said it was being created in response to Ukraine plotting an attack on its ex-Soviet neighbor in the north. Lukashenko didn’t provide any evidence to back up his claim.

Moscow has used Belarus as a staging ground for its full-scale invasion and regular rocket attacks, but Belarusian troops have not been directly involved in Russia’s war effort in Ukraine.

Lukashenko’s statements stoked fears that the joint force would attack Ukraine from the north, aiming to disrupt corridors used to transport Western-supplied weapons across the country.

Belarusian military officials, however, insisted that the force was being created for defensive purposes only.

As Russian soldiers were deploying in Belarus, Belarusian authorities arrested at least four activists they accused of plotting terrorist attacks to sabotage the operation.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s capital is reeling from a Russian barrage of suicide drones packed with explosives, which killed at least three people.

The blasts set fire to Kyiv buildings and sent people scurrying to air raid shelters. Some tried to shoot down the kamikazes.

One of the drones slammed into a residential building, killing three people, according to the deputy head of the Ukrainian president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko.

Energy facilities were also targeted as Moscow tries to disrupt Ukraine’s heating supply as winter approaches.

The Russian military said they used “long-range air and sea-based high precision weapons” to strike Ukraine’s military and energy facilities.

The attack came a week after Russia unleashed its most widespread strikes against the country in months and as Moscow struggles to halt a Ukrainian battlefield counteroffensive.

Kyiv’s daily life soon resumed in a city that has become grimly accustomed to attacks.

___

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian nuclear energy company Energoatom says external power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was once again cut off due to shelling by Russian forces.

The attack Monday struck a power substation on Ukrainian territory that supplies power to the plant, Energoatom said.

The plant is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. While it six reactors have been shut down due to the fighting, it needs power supply to ensure critical safety systems remain operational.

Those power supplies have been repeatedly taken offline, forcing the plant’s operator to temporarily use diesel generators to power the safety systems.

Energoatom repeated its call for a demilitarization of the plant and the withdrawal of Russian forces that surround it.

Formin: Estonia to ban import of Russian oil products already in December

TALLINN, Oct 25, BNS - Estonia wants to move a ban on oil products imported from Russia to an earlier date and if the decision is approved by the government, the ban would already enter into force from December 2022, Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu told Postimees.

According to currently valid European-wide sanction decisions, crude and oils obtained from bituminous minerals can be imported until Dec. 5 and other refined oil products until Feb. 5 on the condition the entrepreneur had signed their contract before June 4.

"The European Union has established a gradual transition period for sanctioning the import and transit of Russian crude oil and oil products with a deadline at the end of February next year. Due to Estonia's geographical location next to Russia and our ports, transit has nonetheless continued. It has been the position of Estonia this whole time that this should be terminated fast," the foreign minister told the newspaper.

"Considering that the Riigikogu has declared Putin's regime a terrorist regime and the war has entered a new and bloodier phase, the government made the decision in principle already last week, and I hope that a formal regulation will also be made. It means that the transition period is to be shortened -- from Dec. 5, the transit of Russian oil and oil products must be terminated completely," Reinsalu added.

The foreign minister said that he has sent on behalf of the Estonian Republic a proposal to the European Commission on a new package of sanctions that would establish comprehensively and without delay an energy sanction against Russian natural gas and oil. 

Reinsalu also introduced the said positions to his French counterpart Catherine Colonna who is on a visit to Estonia.

"She took note of this information and underscored that France, too, has made its proposals for the ninth package. This model has the Commission performing the role a gatekeeper -- proposals are submitted to the Commission by the member states and the Commission will then start looking for the lowest common denominator between them," the minister said.

TALLINN, Oct 27, BNS - The Estonian government is planning to establish a sanction on Thursday banning the purchase, import and transfer of Russian crude oil and oil products due to the Russian Federation's aggression in Ukraine.

Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu said earlier this week that the ban is slated to enter into effect from the start of December.

According to currently valid European-wide sanction decisions, crude and oils obtained from bituminous minerals can be imported until Dec. 5 and other refined oil products until Feb. 5 on the condition the entrepreneur had signed their contract before June 4.

"The European Union has established a gradual transition period for sanctioning the import and transit of Russian crude oil and oil products with a deadline at the end of February next year.

The Estonian authorities announced Thursday that they have banned the import of petroleum products from Russia, a measure that will come into force on December 5.

The country's foreign minister, Urmas Reinsalu, said at a press conference that the measure has been taken in advance in the framework of the sanctions imposed by the European Union against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine, according to information from the newspaper 'Ohtuleht'.

The EU sanctions stipulate that the import of oil derivatives produced from bituminous minerals will be restricted as of December 5, although it allows imports of other products to continue until February 5.

"The Government has today approved a decree banning the import of (...) certain petroleum products from Russia as a national sanction, and it will come into force on December 5. If we look at the volumes, we will see that since the beginning of the year we transported more than half a million tons of Russian oil products," Reinsalu said.

A statement declaring Russia a terrorist regime, calls for more sanctions against Moscow and more assistance for Ukraine were among the main topics discussed by Estonian media on 18-24 October.

Russia declared 'terrorist regime'

The Estonian parliament has adopted a statement condemning the annexation of sovereign territories in Ukraine by Russia and declaring the latter a terrorist regime. The statement added that Estonia will never recognise the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine through aggressions and sham referendums. "Violation of law can never create law. Putin's regime, with its threats of nuclear attack has transformed Russia into the biggest danger to peace both in Europe and in the whole world," the statement reads. "Supporting an appeal from Ukraine's parliament to nations and international organizations, the Riigikogu [parliament] has declared Russia a terrorist regime and the Russian Federation a country which supports terrorism, whose actions we must confront together. The Riigikogu calls on the international community to adopt similar declarations," the statement notes. Parliament also called on the European Union and Nato member states to decisively increase military aid to Ukraine, as well as humanitarian aid to Ukraine, plus support for the country in its post-war reconstruction. (ERR, in Estonian, 18 Oct 22)

Russia's 'martial law' seen as 'escalation'

Russia's decision to declare martial law in occupied Ukrainian territories is an "escalation" and "unacceptable", Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu said on 19 October. "We are seeing another escalation by Putin in his war against Ukraine. The decision by the Russian leadership to declare martial law in the illegally annexed territories of Ukraine is unacceptable and Estonia strongly condemns these steps. It is yet another desperate move in an attempt to reinforce his position in Ukraine that has been shaken by Ukrainian forces," the minister said in a statement. Earlier on 19 October, Vladimir Putin imposed martial law in the four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine Russia claimed to have annexed. (Delfi, in Russian, 19 Oct 22)

Call for more sanctions

The Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has presented the European Commission with its proposals for new measures against Russia and Belarus and wants to see the ninth sanctions package executed quickly. Estonia wants the ninth package of sanctions to include extended and strengthened measures against Russia in the sectors of energy, banking, media propaganda and commerce, with additional sanctions against persons, the ministry communicated. "The principled decision of the European Council to ramp up Russia sanctions is an expression of political will that needs to be put into action quickly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu said. So far, eight sanctions packages have been imposed aimed at completely paralysing the Russian economy and making it impossible to continue funding the war. (ERR, in Estonian, 22 Oct 22)

Call for more aid for Ukraine

Time must not work to the advantage of Vladimir Putin's regime, Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu said at a meeting with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on 18 October. The minister said it was crucial to increase Ukraine's defence capabilities, including by raising assistance via the European Peace Facility to 50bn euros. "I welcome the decision of the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday to approve an additional trance of 500m euros but this is not sufficient for increasing Ukraine's defence capabilities," he said. The minister also highlighted Germany sending weapons to the country and thanked Baerbock for the German contribution to the Nato Air Policing Mission in Estonia. He called for discussions for the next wave of European Union sanctions to begin "immediately". "Time must not work to the advantage of Vladimir Putin's regime," Estonia's top diplomat said. (Delfi, in Estonian, 18 Oct 22)

Ties with Belarusian opposition

Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu said on 24 October that Estonia plans to appoint an "ambassador at large" to cooperate and strengthen ties with the Belarusian opposition. Reinsalu was speaking during Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya's one-day visit to Tallinn. A statement after the meeting said Estonia wishes to step up cooperation with the democratic opposition of Belarus, which has its main centre in Vilnius. "We plan to appoint an ambassador at large to Vilnius for contacts with the democratic forces of Belarus in Vilnius," the foreign minister said. Reinsalu said Estonia will continue to support the democratic aspirations of the Belarusian opposition and civil society to make sure that violations of human rights and international law do not go unnoticed. Tikhanovskaya said the fate of Belarus is strongly connected with Ukraine's fate, encouraged MPs to keep supporting the country and additional sanctions. "Nothing will be a greater sanction for Putin than a Free Belarus," Tikhanovskaya said. She added that without a free Belarus, there will be no safe Ukraine and no security in Europe. (ERR, in Estonian, 24 Oct 22)

Defence ties with USA

An agreement has been struck in principle which will see the USA contribute additional, rotating military units for the defence of Estonia, and consequently Nato's eastern flank, Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said. Pevkur was on an official visit to the USA and made his comments following a meeting with Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin, where the pair discussed Estonian-US defence cooperation and issues related to the strengthening of Nato's eastern flank and support for Ukraine. "We reached an agreement in principle that the USA will contribute to Estonia's security via additional rotating units and additional capabilities," Pevkur said. "More detailed weapon systems, capabilities and units that will be present in Estonia on a regular basis will be outlined in the near future," he added. (ERR, in Estonian, 19 Oct 22)

Address by Prime Minister Kallas in Riigikogu on the implementation of the EU policy

The 24th of February of this year will forever unite the aspirations of the Estonian and Ukrainian people for freedom and independence. The anniversary is also the darkest hour of our generation, when not only the Ukrainian War of Independence began, but we saw the beginning of the full-scale war for a rule-based world order and for Europe. For us, this dangerous flailing of a fading empire is part of history that is trying to keep going. What we are actually seeing is the final act of the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Vladimir Putin has described the disintegration of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe. If so, with his attack on Ukraine, Putin will bring this so-called catastrophe to fruition. And not for Ukraine, not for Europe, but for Russia itself. On February 24, Russia signed itself out of the civilized world.

Before February, it was naively thought that the era of empires and colonial conquests had remained permanently in Europe´s past, and that the era of peace had arrived. It was at this point that Western and Eastern Europe's assessments of Russia diverged before the war. Not anymore, it has now been realised that Russia is the most serious threat to peace and to our existence. Russia's aggression and massive war crimes against the Ukrainian people have triggered a number of issues that the Russian leadership did not take into account before 24 February. Russia has lost their friends and respect in the eyes of the world. Russia will never again be a reliable partner in the eyes of the rest of the world. Never again.

Estonia, together with the other allies of the Eastern flank of Europe, has been at the forefront of Ukraine's support and international resistance, both in our statements and with personal examples and steadfastness. We don't know exactly how and when this war will end, but we do know how it won't - it won't end with Russia winning. From now on, as a lesson from the Second World War and from our own experience, the issue of responsibility is also extremely important. Without legal judgment and accountability, there is no hope of a just and lasting peace. Russia must make reparation for the damage caused to Ukraine; war crimes and crimes of aggression must be punished.

We must therefore emphasise even more the importance of the fundamental principles of the international order in countries and organisations that are far from war and do not feel the danger so keenly. The most important thing, however, has been the courageous resistance and unwavering will of the Ukrainian state and people. The most important task of the entire international community is to maintain this determination.

Dear Riigikogu

24 February 2022 This attack was the most important turning point of our era for Europe. I honestly admit that I have never felt so European, I have never been so proud of Europe as I am of the reaction and unity that Europe has shown regarding Russia's aggression. The unity and solidarity of the European Union, as well as its leadership, have been key to mobilising the entire Western world against Russia.

Already on 24 February, we decided to sanction the entire elite of the Russian state and impose unprecedented economic sanctions to stop the Russian war machine. At the Versailles Summit in March, we made fundamental decisions to abandon Russian energy and to move more vigorously towards phasing out fossil fuels and to use renewable energy. We also decided together to strengthen European defence and decided, for the first time, to open the European Union's door to Ukraine.

A turning point in the era is also the prospect of European Union membership for Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, the opening of accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO and, hopefully, Schengen membership for Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia. Adherence to these promises is now becoming more and more important in time, as the impact and meaning of these decisions grows with each passing day.

None of these decisions would have come about so quickly if it hadn't been for the war. War requires a quick decision, war requires bold and forward-looking decisions. This, too, is an aspect that Putin's Russia did not take into account. Russia wanted to subjugate Ukraine and crush European unity. In return, he got a stronger and more united Europe than ever before. In return he is facing the world that doesn't love Russia. Some are afraid, some take advantage of Russia, but no one thinks well of them.

Dear Riigikogu

As a result of this war, the world has entered an era where crises are a new normal. It is to be feared that it will take quite a few years before the world can once again enter its regular order. Estonia has been on the right track, assuming that conflicts are comprehensive in nature. The energy crisis and unprecedented inflation, the pressure on borders and migration crises around Europe, the Ukrainian war refugees fleeing the Russian war, the attacks internally and against information and cyberspace, and the support for extremism and instability, as well as the exploitation of other vulnerabilities, are all associated with one reason and one factor - Russian imperialism and the Russian war machine. Unfortunately, however, Russia can only be changed by the Russian people themselves, and today we have no reason to believe that this could happen in the foreseeable future. I do not know if, and when, the time will come when the Russian people will ask themselves and their leaders: why did we need this war? Does Russia lack land, lack natural resources, or what on earth did they expect to achieve with this aggression? Only the Russians themselves can answer that; we can only be better prepared while they seek the answer and those responsible for this. We have to be prepared, then we'll be also less vulnerable.

That is why many decisions are extraordinary and happen for the first time. For the first time in its history, the European Union has funded military aid through the European Peace Facility, and discussions are already under way on how to proceed. The European Peace Facility has also made a remarkable contribution to compensating for and replacing the military resources allocated. The compensation received by Estonia so far is 150 million. We will soon reach agreement on the first joint instrument on the production and acquisition of ammunition, which I called for to be launched urgently at the Versailles Summit. We expect the European Commission to soon launch a medium-term military capability development initiative to consolidate the European military industry, to develop key capabilities in a unified way and to ensure that additional resources for defence serve common defence as much as possible. In cyber defence, we expect a methodology for evaluating cyber investments, based on which we can set a business continuity target for ICT investments. At the end of the year, for the first time in history, a military training mission within the European Union will start to support the Ukrainian Defence Forces.

The solutions to each subsequent crisis we build on the lessons of previous crises. The crisis mechanism, hardened by the European Union health crisis, has helped both Ukraine and the Member States with all kinds of assistance needs. The first launch of temporary protection enabled a unified and solidarity-based response to the unprecedented influx of war refugees. And although 40,000 war refugees have seriously tested Estonia's absorption capacity, without temporary protection there would already be over 100,000 Ukrainian war refugees in Estonia today. This is real solidarity on the part of the European Union. In addition to military assistance, the European Union has provided EUR 7.2 billion in macro-financial assistance to Ukraine and we are on the point of providing even more by 2023. For the first time in history, we will use our unified lending capacity to provide Ukraine with support for survival but also for essential reconstruction. In addition, the use of frozen assets of the Russian State and oligarchs for the benefit of Ukraine should complement this assistance in order to compensate for the damage caused to Ukraine.

Dear Riigikogu

Over the past year, Europe has painfully understood that energy is part of security and that energy connections are, on the one hand, a great opportunity for us, but at the same time, through connections, we are vulnerable. This vulnerability particularly affects energy connections with Russia. In the case of Russia, no one can ever be sure if that connection will be used to deliver energy or an ultimatum. The transition in Europe therefore also concerns the transition in energy production, storage and consumption. I have said before in this room that climate policy is, by its very nature, a policy for the rational use of natural resources and energy. Today's price increase is largely due to high energy and food prices, which in turn have been brought about by the war in Russia. The abandonment of Russian fossil fuels has therefore been too slow rather than too fast. Instead of developing renewable energy, betting on cheap Russian energy was wrong and cost us dearly. Fortunately, to date, these gas pipelines have not become the straw that breaks the back of Ukraine and Europe. Europe is ready for the winter, and quite close to the goal agreed in Versailles of completely getting rid of Russian gas.

I commend the Riigikogu for its courageous decision to raise Estonia's renewable electricity ambition to one hundred per cent of consumption by 2030. Part of Europe's adaptation is the transformation of the energy market to increase the share of renewable energy and accelerate projects. In the Government, we decided to submit amendments to the Electricity Market Act, which is already pending before the Riigikogu. We are removing obstacles to existing projects and, above all, we intend to speed up projects at the development stage. In the 2030 perspective, however, with the participation of the prime ministers of the region and the President of the European Commission, we decided to increase the volume of offshore wind energy in the Baltic Sea by seven times. In August, the Estonian-Latvian joint offshore wind farm project ELWIND was also added to the list of European Projects of Common Interest and we are working to get Estlink 3 on the list to solve the external connections that are today bottlenecks with Finland. In order to accelerate new capacities, we will also carry out a survey of Estonia's preferred wind park areas in two years. At the same time, we believe that the opportunities arising from the RePower initiatives must also be available for existing projects.

The good news, therefore, is that economic prosperity can be decoupled from fossil fuels, and renewable energy is also a viable source of energy. The new green investment classification will enable sustainable investments to be accelerated. Decisions on the accounting of nature capital, on the sustainability of supply chains and on the responsibility of company managers also complement this. The decisions taken provide investment security for an energy transition and better consideration of nature in economic decision-making. This will finally enable energy intensive industry to abandon the "burnt land tactic" of burning oil shale, peat, forest and circular waste. Instead of making large scale investments in natural gas, we should be investing in renewable energy and in the use of bio- and synthetic gases.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

In the midst of crises requiring an immediate response, we cannot lose sight of the longer term either. We need to change what we do so that our children and grandchildren can also enjoy a healthy environment and climate.

At the United Nations, we have set ourselves the goal of controlling global warming and preventing catastrophe scenarios by 2050. I would remind you here of what the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Dag Hammarskjöld, said, namely that the aim of the United Nations is not to lead mankind into heaven, but to rescue it from hell. The challenge of stopping the warming of the planet while remaining within the natural limits of the planet rests to a large extent on the shoulders of developed industrialized nations.

We have reached the end of the negotiations on the European Union's Fit for 55 climate agreement. A remarkable agreement has now been reached that the last new car with an internal combustion engine will be sold in Europe in 2035. Transportation, agriculture, waste, buildings are our concern at the moment, because we are currently on a path of 13% reduction in emissions, but the target is 24%. Failure to do so could amount to EUR 225 million per year in commitments to the national budget for the acquisition of additional emission allocations.

In recent years, we have also reached a difficult stage in the forestry and land use sector, as the sector has already become a carbon emitter instead of carbon sequestration. Despite intensive negotiations, we achieved a number of flexibilities and compensation opportunities for Estonia, on which to build a further action plan. Irrespective of the flexibilities achieved, however, it is quite clear that the old way will not take us forward. Instead of exporting wood and fuel, the sector's focus must be on increasing carbon storage and added value. After all, we want Estonian nature and Estonian forests to survive, so we have to choose how we can better add value to the wood from our forests and make wooden products that also store carbon, be it furniture or wooden houses.

Discussions are also coming to a close in the area of industrial and energy emissions trading, which is the only sector to date that has reduced emissions. We have succeeded here in protecting the maintenance of free allocations, which is important for the oil shale sector. We have also been able to agree on a more effective carbon price control mechanism. In the future, it will be possible to intervene automatically and quickly on the market in the event of too steep a carbon price increase in order to stabilise the price, and ultimately to ensure a smoother transition and a more predictable carbon price for companies. Equal competition with third countries should, however, be ensured in the future by a new carbon border adjustment mechanism.

With regard to climate and energy policy, the government already has a concrete action plan to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy. With the support of the work of the expert group, the Government Green Policy Committee has reached the final stages of evaluating various areas, mapping measures and preparing the action plan, but concrete choices and decisions must be made already by the next government and the next Riigikogu. The good news is that Estonia has more than EUR 3 billion of European Union funds directly aimed at climate change. Just over a month ago, the Just Transition Fund for Ida-Virumaa was launched, and I am extremely pleased that Silmet has already announced a major investment in its magnet factory. Estonia will not remain a bystander in the international arena either, as we have just decided that the next major foreign policy goal could be the preparation meeting of the UN's major climate meeting, or pre-COP29, which would be held in Estonia in 2024.

Dear Riigikogu

2022 has simply not been just another year and Russian aggression has not simply been another incident. This is a turning point and a year after which the world will no longer be what it was nine months ago. Sooner or later, the war will end, but the wounds from this war will remain for a long time. Aggressors who have wanted to subjugate and destroy other nations have been seen in history before. But they've never gone unpunished. Not this time, either.

President Zelenskyy has expressed his readiness for a just peace. Its content is respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine in the sense of the UN Charter, securing Ukraine for the future in order to protect itself, restoring and rebuilding, including the use of Russian assets, and prosecuting Russian crimes committed during the war. The European Union and Estonia will support Ukraine fully and for as long as necessary. We should make sure that if we ever look back on today, we will not only remember the great war that began in 2022, but also the time that brought out the best in us and was our finest hour. We are great and generous when we extend a hand to Ukraine in distress, both over here and over there. We are small and petty when we turn our backs on people in need and seek only self-interest in all relationships. We're not going break, we're not going to give up, we're going make it. Because our way of life, our freedom, our well-being and our security depend on it.

Dear Riigikogu,

In my speech today, I was only able to touch on some of the most important aspects of government action in the European Union this year. Inevitably, most of our concerns these days are linked in one way or another to war. I assure you and the Estonian people that we will continue to be good allies to our partners and we will not forget our people. We'll get through these difficult times together. We stand by Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in our thoughts and actions.

Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues and allies, as well as the French and Czech Presidencies of the Council of the Union, who have all worked tirelessly and magnificently in this pivotal year of suffering. I thank the Riigikogu for its active work and confidence. I hope that the next speaker on Estonia and the EU will continue on the path of strong Europe and will not have to start rescuing Estonia alone. If Europe is strong, so is Estonia.

Long live Estonia! Long live Europe! Thank you!

TALLINN, Nov 25, BNS - From Monday morning, applicants will be able to book an appointment for filing their residence permits application for December based on the immigration quota for 2023.

To submit a residence permit application with the Police and Border Guard Board, an appointment needs to be booked on the website https://broneering.politsei.ee/[https://broneering.politsei.ee/] .

In addition to the Police and Border Guard Board's service offices, applications can also be filed at Estonia's embassies, however, prior consultation is needed. Applicants who want to have their residence permit extended and who have given their fingerprints to the Police and Border Guard Board in the past six years can submit their application via mail or email.

The Estonian government has established the cap for immigration for 2023 at 1,307 people and the quota has been distributed as follows -- 600 fixed-term residence permits for work can be granted for foreign nationals in the area of manufacturing, 200 in construction, 100 in storage and warehousing, five for entrepreneurship, five based on a foreign agreement, 19 for working in a performing arts institution as a person engaged in creative activities within the meaning of the law, and 30 for professional activities as an athlete, coach, sports referee or sports worker at the invitation of the corresponding sports association. 35 fixed-term residence permits for work can also be issued to journalists accredited by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The remaining part of the quota for 313 people can be distributed freely. 

"If a residence permit application by a foreign national does not fall under the said categories, they must take into consideration that their applications will fall under the quota that is to be distributed freely," officer at the bureau for identity and status at the Police and Border Guard Board Liis Valk said.

"From Jan. 1, an amendment to the Aliens Act will enter into force which will enable to apply for a residence permit outside the quota if the individual has been engaged in short term employment in Estonia for at least nine consecutive months and their employment has been registered. These applications can be filed from January. We recommend that foreign national make an well considered choice whether to apply based on the immigration quota or pursuant to the legal amendments about to enter into force because the Police and Border Guard Board will not handle two residence permit applications per person at once," Valk added.

Filing a residence permit application does not provide foreign nationals with a legal basis for staying in the country. If the alien's visa or other basis of stay ends before a decision is made with regard to their residence permit application, the foreigner has to leave Estonia and wait for the decision in their home country. In this case, they may need to inform the Police and Border Guard Board and change the place where they receive their residence permit card if they initially arranged to receive said document in Estonia.

A government-imposed sanction remains valid for citizens of Russia and Belarus and no residence permits are issued to them for work or entrepreneurship.

Appointments are mandatory for foreign nationals for filing a residence permit application. The appointment is not for the employer and employers cannot use the appointment for any other employees.

Appointments are only for the individual who has made the appointment. Applications are not accepted at appointments made by another person.

Appointment cannot be changed. If the person is unable to attend their appointment, they must cancel it and make a new one. Canceled reservations will reopen in the calendar for everyone after some time.

Additional information is provided by migration consultants of the Police and Border Guard Board: https://www.politsei.ee/en/migration-consultants[https://www.politsei.ee/en/migration-consultants] .

People whose applicants do not fall under the immigration quota but whose basis of stay is about to end and who are unable to book an appointment to file an application are requested to contact the Police and Border Guard Board.

Estonian PM: We're close to agreement on price cap for Russian oil

TALLINN, Dec 01, BNS – Speaking at the government's press conference in Tallinn on Thursday, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said that, in her opinion, the European Union is close to an agreement on an upper limit for the price of Russian crude oil and she hopes that a deal will be struck already on Thursday.

According to Bloomberg, EU member states are currently discussing setting a cap on the price of Russian crude at 60 US dollars per barrel. Previously, a price limit in the range from 65 to 70 dollars was considered possible, Postimees reported.

The new price cap proposal is supposed to help reach agreement between the bloc's dissenting groups. EU talks on capping Russian oil prices stalled last week, with Poland and the Baltic states demanding a price that puts more pressure on Moscow's revenues, arguing that current proposals, which have reached 62 dollars, are too generous. Greece and other shipping nations meanwhile want the price cap to be higher.

"We have always wanted it [price cap - ed.] to be below the market price. If the market price is, I presume, 68 at the moment, then 60 is definitely below the market price," Kallas told the press conference.

"We have been talking about a sanction on Russian oil from the very beginning, that it feeds the Russian war machine and that these revenues must be cut off. Now the question is where this limit is going to be," the premier said, explaining that a balance needs to be struck between cutting Russia's revenues and making sure that oil will still be available.

"But we are quite close to an agreement, I hope it will be reached later today," she added.

Estonian formin: USD 60 price cap on Russian oil not enough

TALLINN, Dec 02, BNS – Member states of the European Union reached an agreement on Friday and established a cap on the price of Russian crude oil at 60 US dollars per barrel, which, according to Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu, is a step forward, but far from enough.

"With our policy, we were able to bring the price cap lower than the European Commission's earlier proposal. This is today's result, but much more needs to be done," Reinsalu was quoted by ministry spokespeople as saying.

Estonia has a clear position that the price cap on Russian oil must be constantly brought down in order to reduce as much as possible the Russian cash flows with which to finance the aggression against Ukraine, the minister stressed.

"Our goal is to deprive Russia of the means to finance its aggressive military activities against the country, people and sovereignty of Ukraine. The price cap established today is also too high and does not fully fulfill this goal, but I am hopeful that we will be able to bring it down in further discussions. It is important for us that today's decisions clearly stated that it is possible to revise the price cap," Reinsalu said.

A review clause, according to which the price cap on Russian oil will be reviewed every two months to assess whether the current limit price is correct given the circumstances and, if necessary, set a new limit, was added to the agreement.

"One of the basic principles of today's decision was that the price cap on Russian oil products should be at least 5 percent below the average market price. This already means a financial loss for Russia, but it is not enough. We support the consistent development of new sanctions against Russia to bring the Russian war machine to a standstill. The price cap on Russian oil, the work launched on the ninth package of sanctions, progress on the use of Russia's frozen assets in support of Ukraine and support for a tribunal for prosecuting crimes of aggression -- this is a message from the European Union to Russia that the crimes committed and damages caused must be paid for and the decision to attack another country will not go unpunished. We have been working for several months on the significant developments of these last few days," the foreign minister added.

The price cap on Russian crude oil will be enforced through transport and service provision bans. Specifically, from Monday, Dec. 5, it is prohibited to transport to third countries Russian oil that has been purchased for more than 60 US dollars per barrel. It is also not allowed to provide services, including insurance services, to ships transporting more expensive Russian oil. Transitional periods have been provided for companies to take Russian oil purchased before Dec. 5 to its destination.

From Dec. 5, an EU sanction will also come into force that prohibits the import of Russian seaborne crude oil to Europe, establishing an exception only for oil imported through pipelines. In the case of setting the oil price cap, it is a supplementary measure to this sanction, not a substitute for it.

ESTONIA: RUSSIAN PRICE CAP TO HAVE LITTLE IMPACT

The price cap on Russian oil will have a very limited, if not non-existent, impact on Pootin's ability to finance his military campaign, says Mart Raamat, head of the Estonian Oil Association. Raamat believes the move is more a case of political posturing.

On December 2, EU countries reached an agreement to cap the price of Russian oil at $60 dollars a barrel.

However, head of the Estonian Oil Association Mart Raamat told ERR, that he believes the decision was primarily political maneuver. According to Raamat, the price cap was imposed by the EU and the other major G7 industrialized countries as a sanction (against Russia), but, by its very nature would also have an impact on third countries.

"All the big Western countries - the EU, the UK and the US - have already given up or are giving up imports of Russian oil and so imposing this price cap does not really affect their oil supplies," Raamat explained. "Their point, however, is to influence oil importers from third countries to pay less for Russian oil."

Raamat singled out China, India and Turkey as major partners, whose imports would likely be affected by the decision, noting that the price imposed was higher than the amount currently paid for Russian oil. As a result, it will therefore be very difficult to predict how many third countries will participate in imposing the price cap.

According to Raamat, Europe and the West are hoping, that as the EU will also ban the insurance of vessels transporting Russian oil at more than $60 dollars a barrel by European insurance companies, this may act as an incentive for third countries to join in with the price cap.

"However, the actual impact this will have on Pootin's ability to finance his military campaign is still not very well understood," said Raamat, adding that he believed it would be limited at best.

What the price cap was intended to achieve remained quite unclear, according to Raamat, who suggested that Western countries might have backed down somewhat under pressure after Russia sent a clear message that it would no longer supply oil to countries, which signed up to participate in the price cap.

However, according to Raamat, the price cap, which has been set, is such, that Russia will continue to receive the same price on the world oil market as it has up to now, and has most likely planned when considering its national budget for next year.

"So, the impact is practically non-existent and, in fact, it seems that it may have been more a political move than a meaningful sanction," he said.

Raamat added, that he, along with many other analysts, found it difficult to see how a price cap would actually reduce Russia's ability to generate export revenues from oil. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

Presentation

CLAUS INGAR JENSEN, HEAD OF IR, DANSKE BANK A/S: Good evening, and welcome to Danske Bank's conference call. My name is Claus Ingar Jensen. And with me today, I have our Group CFO, Stephan Engels; and our Head of Group Legal, Kasper Friis-Hansen. Given the significance of the announcement we have made today in relation to the bank settlement of the Estonia matter with the U.S. and Danish authorities, we wanted to provide you with an update on the settlement and financial outlook. We aim to keep this presentation brief and we'll open for a Q&A session afterwards, keeping the entire session to around 30 minutes. Please go to slide 2, and I will now hand over to Stephan.

STEPHAN ENGELS, CFO & MEMBER OF EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM, DANSKE BANK A/S: Thank you, Claus, and good evening everyone, and thank you for joining us on this short notice so late in the day. Today marks a significant milestone for Danske Bank as we have reached the final resolution with the U.S. and Danish authorities, which will finally allow us to move on from the regrettable mistakes that were made in relation to our Estonian operations. The legal consequences and our full admission is outlined in the company announcement from earlier this evening. Under the terms of the coordinated resolution and as part of the (inaudible) agreement, the financial impact amount to DKK 15.3 billion, in line with our Q3 communication. With the prudent capital management practices, the Board has taken to cancel the remaining 2021 dividend as well as the proposal not to pay out any 2022 dividend. This has kept Danske Bank sufficiently capitalized to mitigate the impact of the settlement while keeping a buffer for the upcoming regulatory requirements and ability to support our clients through the current macro uncertainties. At Danske Bank, we have taken important and necessary steps to ensure that the bank has robust measures in place to do everything possible to prevent past failures taking place again. As an integral part of our strategy, we aim to be a positive contributor to the societies we operate in, supported by the investments we have made to improve Danske Bank's resilience. We remain committed to learn from the past mistakes, and I will now outline some of the many ways we have improved our financial crime prevention.

Next slide, please. Going forward, and with the lessons we have learned from Estonia, we remain committed to fight financial crimes in all forms. Since we launched our Better Bank agenda in 2019, we have deployed significant resources to our financial crime plan agenda and taking extensive action to address previous failings in order to prevent a recurrence. We have invested more than EUR 12 billion in AML compliance since 2018 and now have over 3,500 FTEs occupied with fighting financial crime. This has also led to a complete refresh of due diligence data of 2.6 million customers against the new and improved standard covering 99.9% of targeted customers. Furthermore, we have a completely new leadership in place and enhanced our operational setup with the intention to establish a compliance function based on international best practice. Moreover, we have derisked our footprint to focus on our core markets in addition to the exit from Russia and the Baltic countries also encompass the sale of our Luxembourg branch and the closing of our Hamburg branch. With the continuity in leadership that Carsten Egeriis has brought as a CEO and relentless execution in our car markets, we are setting Danske Bank up so we can quickly adapt and mitigate our future threats.

Through our central role in society, we strive to be a key adviser to our clients on all aspects of fighting financial crime, including how to navigate new sanctions as we have seen this year. Finalizing our financial crime plan transformation, thus remains a key priority for us, and we are doing so in close collaboration with the independent expert appointed by the Danish FSA. We remain on track for completion by the end of next year, after which we will enter a business as usual stage, leveraging of the vast improvement that has been made to KYC and digitalization of transaction monitoring and sanction screening and so on. Finally, strengthening our culture throughout the organization to foster a strong compliance culture where potential mistakes and mishabits are escalated and addressed with transparency and integrity is how we intend to run Danske Bank, a tone that is clearly set from the very top.

Next slide, please. As we are about to wrap up an eventful year, we have continued to make progress across Danske Bank for all stakeholders. This final settlement resolution with the U.S. and Danish authorities that we have announced today, coupled with the announcement from August regarding the solution for our debt collection customers, underlying a year where we once and for all can put these legacy cases behind us. Coupled with heightened geopolitical uncertainties, changed macro landscape and volatile financial markets, the provision and one-off costs we have taken in relation to our legacy cases will lead to a net loss for the year as we have communicated in our Q3 release. As business activity remains sound, we reaffirm our outlook for the banking income as well as financial market-related income. On this background, we now expect net profit for the full year to be better than a loss of EUR 5.3 billion as the financial impact of the amount resolution is slightly lower than our initial provision. For 2023, we remain comfortable that the foundation of Danske Bank and the enhancement of resilience and operational efficiency will result in a positive trajectory in our cost-to-income ratio. The growth in our core banking income driven by higher rates is expected to more than mitigate the impact of higher inflation on costs and any potential impact on asset quality. As such, we remain committed to our return on equity ambition of 8.5% to 9% with upside potential to current guidance as we are tracking towards the upper end of the range. With that, I will hand back to Claus.

CLAUS INGAR JENSEN: Thank you, Stephan. Those were our initial comments and messages. We are now ready for your questions. Please limit yourself to 2 questions. If you are listening to the conference call from our website, you are welcome to ask questions by e-mail. A transcript of this conference call will be added to our website within the next few days. Operator, we are ready for the Q&A session.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster? Our first question or comment comes from the line of Jakob Brink. Mr. Brink your line is open.

JAKOB BRINK, SENIOR ANALYST & SECTOR COORDINATOR, NORDEA MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Thanks a lot, and good evening, and thanks for hosting this call, and congratulations as well on final settlement. Actually, my questions are not so much related to the actual fine, but I'm a bit surprised, it's almost a bit ironic that while you choose to keep basically your underlying guidance for this year unchanged, only upgrading with the slightly smaller fine, Spar Nord, Danish peer bank is out for the second time within a month and upgrading their profit guidance for this year by another 10%. I think every other Danish bank have upgraded by around 10% over the past month. And yet, there's nothing to see in your guidance. So why is that? What is it that Danske is not doing right?

STEPHAN ENGELS: Jakob, thanks for the congratulations, although that doesn't feel like a day to celebrate to start with, but nevertheless, I think on the guidance, I would claim that we have just updated the guidance a couple of weeks ago with Q3. And I think not that much has changed since then, other than the early estimate has seen some final adjustments, which we have reflected in the guidance. So better than 5.3% is what we are guiding for right now.

JAKOB BRINK: But the guidance you gave in connection with the Q3 report, as far as I recall, that was exactly the same as the one you had before, just deducting the fine and the goodwill impairment. So then you got to DKK 5.5 billion loss. Then as rate has come up significantly since you gave that guidance, which was even older than Q2, I think the DKK 10 billion to DKK 12 billion was from the 10th of July, which was before the first rate hike. So significant grade support, mortgage spreads have narrowed, high activity, no losses. So I guess I'm still just a bit puzzled why that doesn't impact Danske Bank?

STEPHAN ENGELS: Jakob. Thanks again for the question. But again, I think the guidance that we have given today is the best of our knowledge for now. And I think that is what it is for the moment.

JAKOB BRINK: Okay. Fair enough. And then on the capital position of Danske, as you pointed out in the announcement, you had 16.9% CET1 at Q3. The new target I think you said you would return with that in connection with the Q4 report. But it looks like still there should be some room for excess -- for payouts. Now you say you will propose not to pay a dividend for '22. Is there any time line of when you could maybe resume some kind of payout. It is a few years finish you last paid anything.

STEPHAN ENGELS: First of all, technically speaking, we are making a loss for 2022, which means that paying out a dividend is, I would say, a very, very unlikely event and in that sense, also the BOD has decided to propose no dividend to the AGM in early '23. Secondly, given the outlook for the year to come, I think -- and that's what we also said in Q3 that we believe a capital level above 16% is what we feel comfortable with and that remains unchanged. And to more detail, I would -- or more specific guidance, I would point you a little bit towards our annual report, which is due on February 2.

JAKOB BRINK: Okay. So we get more details on the capital targets and/or payouts at that time?

STEPHAN ENGELS: I think you get definitely more details on a lot of numbers, and I can say that much, that our capital distribution policy as you know that has been published for the last couple of years remains unchanged. But again, for 2022, I don't see any potential way to pay dividend.

JAKOB BRINK: Okay. Very clear. Thanks a lot, Stephan.

CLAUS INGAR JENSEN: Okay. I think that was the only question we had. So thank you all for your interest in Danske Bank and for your questions. As always, you are welcome to contact our Investor Relations department. If you have more questions after you have had time to look at the announcement in details. Good evening.

STEPHAN ENGELS: Thank you very much.

CLAUS INGAR JENSEN: Thank you very much.

Estonian envoy sees no end to Ukraine war while Putin in power

The Estonian ambassador to Russia has said that the war in Ukraine is unlikely to end for as long as Vladimir Putin remains in power. In an interview with Estonian Public Broadcasting, Marcus Laidre described Russia's offer of peace talks as "propagandist" and suggested that its "covert aim" is to allow the country to take a time-out and build up reserves since Ukraine retains the initiative on the battlefield. He also quoted an unidentified former insider as saying that Moscow was "seriously considering" a nuclear strike at an unspecified "moment" during the Yugoslav Wars. The following is the text of Tarmo Maiberg's interview with Laidre titled "Ambassador: Mistake to think Putin enemies automatically on our side" and published in English by the ERR News website, operated by Estonian Public Broadcasting, on 27 December; subheadings inserted editorially:

Believing that everyone who is against Russian President Vladimir Putin is on our side amounts to making a big mistake in Estonia and elsewhere, Estonian Ambassador to Russia Margus Laidre told ERR in an interview. He added that the Ukraine war will not end for as long as Putin remains in power.

[Maiberg] What went through your head when the war started?

[Laidre] I'm a morning person. I usually get up around 6 a.m., while I decided to sleep a little longer that day since it was February 24, the Estonian Independence Day. My phone rang at 7:36 a.m. It was my son, who works at the Estonian Embassy in Stockholm, calling with two surprises for me. The first news was very good as I learned I now had two grandsons. The other was the war. Those two things coinciding - great joy that I had a grandson and the terrible news of the war... A difficult moment and one of uncertainty.

Thinking back to Putin's rhetoric at the start of the war, threatening an unprecedented response if anyone tried to stop him, if memory serves... It gave us pause and prompted a meeting at the embassy. A joint meeting of envoys from the EU, Canada, USA and the U.K. followed. And the war started unfurling from there.

'Well-informed' people seen 'mentally distancing' themselves from war

[Maiberg] If the view in the West is that the war has not gone well for Russia, does the Russian person realise their leaders have miscalculated?

[Laidre] Talking about Russia, we need to first realise that we have to talk about several different Russias therein. Therefore, public opinion is much more diverse than it may seem. Looking at the periphery, loyalty to the state and patriotism are felt much more strongly compared to major cities. Let us say television is still the dominant source of information in the border regions. While this dominance has been weakened of late, dropped from 90 percent to 60 percent, it is still the main source of news.

Things are quite different in larger cities. People are relatively well-informed in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. People in my circle use alternative sources of information. They are up to speed on developments, while the relevant question is whether they always want to admit what they see. Trying to mentally distance oneself from the war is a common reaction - it does not concern me, it is not my war and I have nothing do with it.

Things have changed since the partial mobilisation. I have suggested in the past that it constituted a mental divide. If until then people were perhaps tuning in to a TV series they could just as easily tune out of if the script was not to their liking, now [since the mobilisation] it is more akin to seeing a play in the theatre where it is awkward to get up and leave in the middle of the act. That much has changed for people. Russians are also reacting painfully to sanctions, which suggests they are working and serve their purpose. But they feel it [the war] does not concern them and that they're being punished instead of those responsible.

'Draconian regulations' seen putting damper on protests

[Maiberg] In other words, there is dissatisfaction in major cities, but it is not something that has an effect on the leadership or could cause them to reevaluate?

[Laidre] That is a question we often ask ourselves - why have the Russian people not taken to the streets. Russian observers, those worth listening to, suggest there are no protest moods in major cities. Hoping that the people will come to the streets... On the one hand, the authorities have done everything in their power to prevent such demonstrations and protests with draconian regulations. Recent amendments to the foreign agents law can see a person put in prison for a long time for merely visiting a foreign embassy.

We have already felt the law's effects. People we have invited to the embassy have apologised and said they cannot come. Others have asked to use the spare entrance, and the Estonian Embassy only has two entrances. The authorities have also held widely covered show trials to demonstrate that bad things will happen to those who refuse to obey the law.

Protests could follow Russia's economic collapse. But leading economists say that this will not happen, there are no lines in shops, no [spike in] unemployment, and the fading will rather take place over a long time. While the Russian economy is surely stagnating, this will not happen overnight. There are attempts to realign the economy to meet political needs. For example, RosAtom and other military industries in Sverdlovsk Oblast have switched to a six-day workweek and 12-hour days.

[Maiberg] One example is when a girl showed up with a poster that read, "I love my father." Svetlana Poteryahina was ordered to pay a fine of 30,000 rubles for discrediting the army and threatened with terrorism charges during interrogation. There were protests when the war started, while no one is keen to demonstrate now. What would have to happen for people to want and dare to come out? Let's be honest, law enforcement should realise they can no longer just quash protests and attack people.

[Laidre] That question should be put to the Russian people. There were indeed more protest moods when the war started, while there were also more avtozaks or mobile detention cells and riot police. I can remember an incident where young Russian women wore a green scarf. How is a green scarf dangerous, one might ask. Simple - green is the result of mixing yellow and blue. I think that economic difficulty is the biggest, most important factor with the potential of affecting people's behaviour. A rapid economic decline would set people in motion. However, as we have said, the authorities are doing everything they can to avoid that. We need to remember that the real income of Russians has been in decline for 10-15 years. The situation is not new.

Impossible to say what could bring people out onto streets in force

[Maiberg] But we also understand that the Russian person is willing to suffer and suffer greatly. People in the West hardly realise how much a Russian person can take.

[Laidre] Yes, the suffering of the Russian people is almost a historical concept by this point, while I also believe that the new generation of Russians, especially those inhabiting major cities, has become a little more comfortable in a good way. A lot of Russian youths are apolitical. Allow me to give a real life example - a good acquaintance's 21-year-old son left for Kazakhstan to escape the draft. He drives a taxi there and has nothing against Putin. But he went to Kazakhstan because he does not want to kill people or die in the war himself. There is a widely used expression in Russia - krutost, which can be translated as coolness or toughness. Some apolitical Russian youths say that Putin is krutyi (cool). Why? Because he has the stones to stand up to the big boys. While they find it cool, they refrain from judging it either as right or wrong.

I dare not say what could bring the Russian people to the streets in force. But you are right in that it was suggested even before the war that if 100,000 people took to the streets in Russia's ten largest cities, which are home to a little under 30 percent of the population, it could see law enforcement switch sides and join them. But when or under which circumstances this might happen is virtually impossible to say.

Impact of sanctions

[Maiberg] What effect do sanctions have on people's everyday lives?

[Laidre] They first manifested as logistical problems. Certain food products were out of stock, while the previous situation was quickly restored. Inflation of 12-14 percent is another aspect. People have started saving money, buying less food, and while travelling is restricted anyway, spending on entertainment is also down. These are the most direct ways in which they manifest, but, and as I've said, there can be no doubt that the sanctions are working. We also need to have patience in this matter.

/.../ I believe we need patience in the occident to see the sanctions start working and to be prepared for side-effects, strike a balance to make sure the latter do not outweigh the sanction itself. Again, it is clear the sanctions are having an effect, even though the political brass in Russia was given time to prepare. It is surprising compared to 2014, but they did not expect such tough sanctions and admit the latter are having a crippling effect.

Various explanations given for fires, explosions

[Maiberg] While we're on the subject of social perception. We are seeing explosions, fires and other inexplicable circumstances in various institutes, shopping malls, military camps. Is the reaction in Russia that someone has done something wrong somewhere? Is blame being placed and accusations of treason thrown around in Russia?

[Laidre] The older generation knows that the historical question is kto vinovat? (Who is to blame?) There are three possible explanations for these explosions. The first and most traditional is carelessness. It is bardak, if you'll excise the expression, or disorganisation. There have been 12 major fires this year, while there were just three last year. An increase of four times.

The other possibility is that these are successful Ukrainian operations behind Russian lines, which could have something to do with the continued flight ban to 11 cities in southern Russia until December 25 or 27. They include Belgorod, Voronezh and others that can be associated with the war.

The third option, which has been suggested by the embassy's contacts, is that these things are self-organised. So much fuel and other materials were stolen during the Zapad exercise that some of these things have been set on fire in military warehouses and military commissariats to hide the chaos. Once mobilisation sorted out the documentation, fires started happening. In the case of shopping centres, we also cannot rule out economic deficiencies, investigations etc. All three possibilities are on the table. Which one is most at fault or dominates is difficult so say.

Tone of TV talk shows said to have become 'surprisingly critical'

[Maiberg] Has the tone of television talk shows changed in terms of not being able to maintain hurray moods in society?

[Laidre] The tone has changed. It has become surprisingly critical through the mouths of strong Putin supporters. [RT editor-in-chief Margarita] Simonyan and others have publicly asked critical questions, which suggests there is a school of thought in Russia according to which the war is not being conducted decisively enough. These voices have become louder as of late.

[Maiberg] To what extent is the Kremlin allowing them to say these things or curating such remarks?

[Laidre] Again, it is impossible to say for sure, but I believe most of what is happening in the Russian Federation is under the authorities' control, there is no purely spontaneous action. Some measure of it might be permitted, while the Kremlin is still in control.

[Maiberg] It has been suggested that while the war was initially justified through the need to denazify Ukraine, there is increasingly talk of just taking what's needed in Russia. Has this not altered perception of the offensive message in society..

[Laidre] It is the Russian axiom, which many political analysts have pointed to, that it is defending itself even when it looks like it's on the offensive. This helps explain quite a lot. Or emphasising the need for security guarantees-certainty in that the securest border for Russia is one that has Russian troops on both sides of it. These things perhaps best explain the situation.

Russia's offer of peace talks seen aimed at building up reserves

[Maiberg] Is Russia's proposal of peace talks genuine, or is it rather meant to buy the Russian military time to recuperate?

[Laidre] This has been widely debated. As a former historian, I must say that wars and peace talks have happened simultaneously for centuries. There is nothing strange about waging war and negotiating at the same time. This time, the proposal rather comes off propagandist, that Russia has good will, wants to negotiate and end the war, while the covert aim, because Ukraine has clearly held the initiative on the battlefield, is to take a time-out, build up reserves and reinforce, and there is talk of an additional mobilisation. Some have suggested this could happen before the year is out, while I hold that to be unlikely. Rather, the authorities will allow people to welcome the new year and celebrate Christmas, and we might see something then.

Another thing the West might be miscalculating is military activity subsiding in the winter. This is a Central European view. The winter in Central Europe is what we call autumn - muddy roads that are impossible to traverse. Wars have always been waged also in the winter in Northern and Eastern Europe as frozen lakes and rivers become roads. We have no reason to believe the war will quiet down for the winter. Someone who recently visited us in Moscow suggested that a decisive struggle to determine the future of Europe will take place in the next month or two. That there will be a so-called decisive battle. But talking about decisive battles, the Battle of Poltava that saw the destruction of Karl XII's army took place in 1709, while the Great Northern War continued for another 11 years after that.

Moscow said to have 'seriously considered' nuclear strike during Yugoslav wars

[Maiberg] Will we see nuclear weapons used in that decisive battle or should such remarks be seen just as intimidation?

[Laidre] Russian analysts have said that using nuclear weapons would yield no rational benefit. What would Putin use them for? They say that using them against Ukrainians would be pointless. Bringing nuclear arms to bear against London and Washington would result in Russia being wiped from the face of the Earth. I say again that these positions belong to Russian analysts. That nuclear weapons are for deterrence and blackmail. However, all such estimations are based on people acting and thinking rationally.

Now, thinking about traffic, there would be no accidents if everyone acted rationally all of the time. And yet, accidents do happen. Therefore, it is a very fine game and devilishly difficult to say when deterrence or blackmail might morph into action. We can also draw a parallel with the period immediately before the war when Russia was publicly building up troops on the border. Everyone said it was blackmail and deterrence before it all kicked off one morning.

Unpredictability has always been a keyword when it comes to Russia. You never know when the people in charge, who might paradoxically be cut off from information, decide that push has come to shove. The reason I dare suggest something like that is we got a very interesting visitor, who used to belong to the inner circle back in the day, and who said that Moscow was seriously considering a nuclear strike for a moment during the Yugoslav Wars. We don't really know about such moments or when they arrive for decision-makers, but firmly believing that they are just sabre-rattling and will never do anything would also be self-deception.

[Maiberg] Can we then say that the Kremlin and Putin have a secure footing and there is no inner conflict?

[Laidre] As much as I would like to be a fly on that wall, we have no such perspective, nor do others in Moscow. Which is not to say that being here and looking at [Russian] society from within one does not develop a different feel for it than viewed from a thousand kilometres away.

Not everyone who is against Putin is 'automatically on our side'

[Maiberg] Could we suggest that even those supporting a more liberal-democratic worldview are in favour of the Great Russian idea and aren't opposed to imperial expansion?

[Laidre] There is another term that has characterised Russia throughout the years - imperskost, or the imperial spirit. I believe that all major nations versus small nations sport different mentalities. It is inevitable. People think differently due to cultural, historical and other factors. Therefore, I believe we are making a big mistake in Estonia, but also elsewhere, in thinking that everyone who is against Putin is automatically on our side. Unfortunately, that just isn't the case.

Perhaps the brightest historical example of this is Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who was a sworn enemy of the Soviet regime but every bit a Great Russian chauvinist and imperialist. Which is why I would urge people to refrain from quoting him in Estonian national holiday speeches as the context is way off. Some who are without a doubt liberals in Russia are proponents of Great Russia at heart, and not in a bad way. When you ask them when Russia might fall apart, they take offence because they do not want Russia to be dissolved as patriots. These nuances are important and should not be forgotten.

[Maiberg] Will Surovikin succeed in making sure the empire will last for a good long time?

[Laidre] Who knows. We will have to see what happens next.

War may continue for years

[Maiberg] How do people see it today and when will the war end?

[Laidre] Every war eventually ends. That much is clear. The question is when and how. I happened to read an opinion by former Swedish PM Carl Bildt today and I tend to agree with him in that one of the main characters in this war has painted himself into a corner and the paint he used to do so is drying slowly, meaning that the war will likely not end until Putin's time in power will. Making such predictions is a thankless task, but if I had to guess, I would say we need to be prepared for the war continuing for years.

[Maiberg] How difficult is it to work at the embassy today?

[Laidre] We are in a relatively unfriendly environment that limits the embassy's work and places colleagues under quite a lot of psychological pressure. This was felt especially when the war started. Plus the widely discussed state-organised protests, threatening letters etc. It has had an effect on people, while we have held out just fine. The team is strong and no one needs to doubt that the Estonian flag is flying proudly just 800 meters from the Kremlin.

Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!

Today is a new stage of our diplomatic marathon. Four more conversations with European leaders: President of the European Council, Prime Minister of Belgium, President of Estonia and Prime Minister of Ireland.

I informed them about the situation on the battlefield - about the difficult situation in the Donetsk region, about the constant Russian attacks and the fact that Russia does not count its people, does not spare the locals and does not stop before any criminal actions.

This can - and must! - be countered only by a new level of modern military equipment that Ukraine can receive from partners. I thank all the leaders who help us for understanding that now is the time for new powerful decisions, for new powerful support.

The free world has everything necessary to stop Russian aggression and bring the terrorist state to a historic defeat. And it is important not only for us. It is important for global democracy, for all those who value freedom. It is even more important now, when Russia is gathering forces for another escalation.

Together with our partners, we must do - and we are doing! - everything to make it clear to Russia's masters that no escalation will help them. The defeat of the Russian aggression must remain unalterable, no matter who and what Russia tries to throw into the battle.

I am grateful to the President of the European Council for understanding how important it is to maintain the unwavering support of Ukraine. In this confrontation, in which Russia is trying to exhaust all of us - Ukrainians, Europeans, other partners - there must be clarity of signals. Signals that we will go all the way to the defeat of Russian terror. We will go together and with the preservation of stability in Ukraine - financial and social. And that is why financial support was one of the main topics of my conversation with Charles Michel, as well as weapons and further European integration of Ukraine.

I thank the Prime Minister of Belgium for supporting our diplomatic efforts, in particular our Peace Formula, all its fundamental elements: restoration of security, restoration of our territorial integrity, restoration of justice.

I am confident that the leadership of Belgium will help us achieve a fair peace. And I am thankful for the willingness to really bring peace closer by increasing the armed support for our state. The already provided Belgian defense assistance has significantly strengthened our state, and we agreed today that our teams would work on a new supply.

I am grateful to the President of Estonia and all Estonians for new decisions to strengthen our defense. We have also discussed with Mr. President our further steps in the European and Euro-Atlantic integration. I thank Estonia for a very strong representation of Ukraine's interests in Europe. Even when someone doubts, Estonia finds arguments to support Ukraine and to increase sanction pressure on Russia.

I am grateful to the new Prime Minister of Ireland for the willingness to continue the course of Ireland's comprehensive support for Ukraine. We have agreed on a powerful energy support. And I thanked Ireland for freezing Russian assets - we will work together to ensure that these funds are used for the restoration of Ukraine.

In general, since my visit to Washington, I have already held about thirty talks with leaders and representatives of partner states. And I literally feel every day how the world's determination to overcome Russian aggression is growing.

I thank everyone who helps us defend Ukraine and freedom!

I thank everyone who fights for independence!

Today, I would like to pay special tribute to the warriors of the 46th separate airmobile brigade for their bravery and steadfastness in the defense of Soledar! Thank you, warriors!

I thank everyone who works to strengthen Ukraine!

And one more thing.

Based on the materials prepared by the Security Service of Ukraine and the State Migration Service of Ukraine, and in accordance with the Constitution of our state, I have decided to terminate the citizenship of four persons: Andriy Leonidovych Derkach, Taras Romanovych Kozak, Renat Raveliyovych Kuzmin and Viktor Volodymyrovych Medvedchuk.

If people's deputies choose to serve not the people of Ukraine, but the murderers who came to Ukraine, our actions will be appropriate.

And these are not the last such decisions. The services are working.

Glory to Ukraine!

ESTONIA: RUSSIAN OIL PRODUCTS PRICE CAP COULD BE INTRODUCED IN FEBRUARY 2023

Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu (Isamaa) said western countries were discussing the introduction of a price cap on Russian oil products in February. It is still too early to speculate on the exact limit.

The cap will include products such as diesel fuel and fuel oil.

An introductory date of early February has been put forward, with Reinslau highlighting February 5.

"This is also when the full pan-European sanction on Russian oil and oil products will enter into force in parallel, on a general principle," he said.

Exactly what the price will be is not yet known. Estonia wants it to be set as low as possible.

The government still believes the existing $60 per-barrel price cap for Russian crude oil is too high.

"It is clear that an arbitrary number will be put forward at the G7 level and there will be a debate about what that number is, which the European Union will go along with. If we were talking about $60 for oil, that number was twice as low for Russian companies to cut off revenues," the minister said.

The move will not affect the European market.

SEB Bank's economic analyst Mihkel Nestor said fuel sellers were not concerned.

"In the case of diesel in particular, Russia has previously been singled out as an important contributor to the European market. But there has been enough time for local fuel retailers to adapt to the situation to be able to replace Russian diesel. Today, there is no sign of any panic on the market that diesel will run out as a result," he said.

It is not yet known what Russian oil producers plan to do next. Production could be cut or more sold on Asian markets.

"Today, the price was around $47 a barrel. For more efficient production sites, it has been said that around $15 to $20 could be the break-even point, which is still well above this price level," Nestor said. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

Boris Johnson has compared Vladimir Putin with "the fat boy in Dickens" who wants to "make our flesh creep" with threats of using nuclear weapons.

Speaking at a breakfast event on Ukraine at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the former prime minister said: "Putin wants to present it as a nuclear stand-off between between Nato and Russia.

"Nonsense. He's not going to use nuclear weapons, okay. He's like the fat boy in Dickens, he wants to make our flesh creep. He wants us to think about it. He's never going to do it."

He said such a move would put the Russian president into "a complete economic cryogenic paralysis" and "terrify the Russians".

"He's not going to do it. Don't go down that rabbit hole, stop it," Mr Johnson added.

The ex-PM also also urged the audience to "stop worrying about Kremlinology," quipping: "It's difficult to work out what's gonna happen in UK politics, let alone in the Kremlin."

Boris Johnson has said Russia should "get the puck out of Ukraine" after a fellow panellist used an ice hockey analogy at an event in Davos.

Canada's deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland called for more Western support for Ukraine, saying: "I don't skate to where the puck is. I skate to where the puck is going. This puck is going to Ukrainian victory, so let's skate there."

Former prime minister Mr Johnson chimed in: "Tell Putin to get the puck out of Ukraine", prompting laughter from the audience.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said Nato allies should now be prepared to step up support to Ukraine to enable it finally to drive out Russian forces from its territory.

Speaking during a visit to Estonia, Mr Wallace said the UK will be supplying a further 600 Brimstone precision-guided missiles in addition to its latest support package, which includes 14 Challenger 2 main battle tanks.

"In 2023, it is time to turn the momentum that the Ukrainians have achieved in pushing back Russia into gains and making sure Russia understands that the purpose now is to push them back out of Ukraine and to restore Ukraine's sovereignty, which is their right under international law," he said.

Mr Wallace was meeting defence ministers from eastern Europe ahead of a further meeting on Friday of donor nations hosted by the United States in Ramstein, Germany.

Russia's global plans stand on a "knife edge" and the UK and its allies must make sure Ukraine is resupplied quickly so it has the upper hand in the war, ministers have been told.

Opening a backbench business debate on Russia's grand strategy, Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin (Harwich and North Essex) said: "It would be an epic tragedy if we now allowed Russia the time to mass their forces so their brutal war of attrition could become overwhelming.

"It is crucial for the West to increase the tempo of its supply of weapons systems to Ukraine, so that Ukraine rather than Russia can be the first to develop the mobile formations necessary to break the current battlefield deadlock.

"The reality is that Russia's whole grand strategy is on a knife edge. The next few months could be crucial."

Sir Bernard also urged the Government to make sure the UK does not discontinue its supply of tanks, telling MPs: "We must still gear up to defend the UK to deter a war in Europe against a peer enemy. Of course, Russia will invest in sub-surface, space, cyber, but they show no sign of dispensing with large-scale ground forces, heavy armour and artillery.

"If anything, the Ukraine war has convinced the general staff of the need to reinvest in their army."

Ministers were told to ensure the UK has a grand strategy to face down Russia.

Sir Bernard Jenkin concluded his opening remarks by telling MPs: "Without the right apparatus in Government and the right culture in Government we will always be behind the curve of events as we seem to be now, mis-appreciating what is really happening.

"We need to find the right answers to the new evolving threats the UK and the whole of the free world must confront before it is too late."

Conservative former minister Mark Francois asked: "Does he agree with me that part of this is that the German government should now release the legal hold they have over the export of Leopard tanks from European allies to the Ukrainians to allow them the chance to counterattack?"

Sir Bernard replied: "I certainly think that is the case and I think the constant fear of us escalating the conflict has been misplaced, because Putin has escalated the conflict anyway.

"There is nothing that we can do to prevent him escalating. In fact, the signal that we have sent by being too timid, too slow in sending support into Ukraine is we have encouraged him to escalate."

Tory MP Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the Defence Select Committee, told the Commons: "I offer this strategy to help conclude the conflict in 2023. Firstly, let's agree the mission. The ramifications go well beyond Ukraine. Let's all agree what the mission is, what success actually looks like.

"Secondly... let's secure a UN safe haven status for the Port of Odesa so all, not just one-fifth, of those vital grain ships can reach international markets and lower the cost of living everywhere.

"Thirdly let's establish a major Ukrainian armaments factory in eastern Poland. Gifting kit is the right call now absolutely, but is not sustainable in the long term. So let Ukraine develop its own equipment."

He added: "Fourthly lets list the Russian state-sponsored Wagner militia group as a terrorist organisation. Fifthly, let's directly sanction President Putin. He is responsible for this war, so let's freeze his personal assets as well.

"Sixthly, as Ukraine won't be joining Nato any time soon, let's invite Ukraine to join the joint expeditionary force which is that critical umbrella of security that will help deter Russia from attempting to invade in the future.

"And finally, to further leverage our leadership and support for Ukraine, let's appoint a senior UK-Ukraine envoy, answerable directly to the Prime Minister, that would help co-ordinate Whitehall support and align our efforts with our international allies."

The UK is "ill-prepared" for threats that are "coming over the horizon", the chairman of the Defence Select Committee has told the Commons.

Tory MP and former defence minister Tobias Ellwood said: "We are heading into another Cold War, more dangerous than the last. And it saddens me to say this, but we are ill-prepared militarily for the threats that are coming over the horizon, particularly when it comes to the British Army.

"Three critical components of quantity and quality that contribute to our land warfare capability, and indeed more widely to the full spectrum of armed warfare are the tank, the armoured fighting vehicle, and indeed the recce vehicle.

"Our tank, the Challenger 2, was introduced 25 years ago. Back then we had over 900, today we've cut our main battle tank numbers to just 148. These will now finally gain an upgrade, but that won't be complete until 2030.

"Our armoured fighting vehicle the Warrior was introduced 30 years ago, a competent but now dated workhorse... all 700 are being axed, replaced by the Boxer, a wheeled not tracked vehicle, and we're choosing the variant that has no turret, so no serious firepower."

He added: "Finally our recce vehicle, that's the Scimitar. This was introduced over 50 years ago. It should have been replaced by the Ajax three years ago, but a litany of procurement problems means it's still unclear when this may or may not happen."

ESTONIA: OPERAIL EXPECTATIONS A MATTER FOR THE STATE

Juggling both freight rail transit volumes and business sustainability are not possible without change, the outgoing board chair of the state-owned Operail says, while it is up to the state to decide on expectations from the company.

There is no doubt that halting the transit of goods of Russian origin has been economically harmful to Operail, Leon Jankelevitsh, who leaves his post as management board chair next month, says.

"The state certainly was aware of this when it made the decision. Operail certainly does not benefit economically from this, quite the reverse," Jankelevitsh said.

The state, as owner of the company, should however, be responsible for decisions on Operail's future, Jankelevitsh said.

The state's expectation as regards Operail at present is that it be profitable.

"In the current situation and in terms of what Operail is permitted to do nowadays, it is not viable to achieve both goals - of maintaining the transport capacity and do so in a sustainable way - simultaneously. In this respect, the state must decide what its expectations of Operail are in future."

"If the state as owner continues to see it as strategically important that Operail and Eesti Raudtee retain their ability to provide freight services, a system should be developed in which the state could order the required service from Operail and finance it, to the extent needed. Should the state's expectations be different, other solutions may also be considered - for example selling the company to a private investor," Jankelevitsh went on.

Merging Operail with rail track state concern Eesti Raudtee would not be a solution to the company's ills either, he said.

Apart from anything else this would need to be done in line with EU regulations.

The state's order to halt the transit of Russian and Belarusian goods last summer came as no surprise, as it was in principle set last May, Jankelevitsh went on.

"In the last few days, however, there has been a greater understanding of the details of what is permitted, and what is not," he added.

The decision was understandable given the current security situation, he went on, but said that a state decision on its own did not constitute a sanction against Russia and Belarus.

For instance, while Operail setting an example for others might be the right thing to do, Eesti Raudtee, also state-owned, has not put in the same ruling, meaning other market participants, such as The Latvian Railways (LDz) have moved into the space formerly occupied by Operail.

Better coordination between friendly countries in the region was needed, in other words, Jankelevitsh added.

As for his own situation, Jankelevitsh said that board work at Operail over the past year had required quick decision making at a rate hard to prolong alongside the other core tasks, themselves also intensive, and, while he had three to four months left to run in his term, he was resigning now "with a relatively calm spirit" and at a time when the transfer of Operail's non-strategic business lines, as worked on by the Operail board and it supervisory board, were now coming to an end.

As for the future, freight rail transport depends a lot on the financing model and how much the state is willing to invest in it and whether it can be organized together with other market participants, Jankelevitsh went on.

Ultimately, freight rail transit in Estonia is not dead, Jankelevitsh said, noting its safety and environmental advantages over, for instance, road transit, but rather changes to finance models including infrastructure fees and their calculations, concluded involving Operail, Eesti Raudtee and Consumer Protection and Technical Regulatory Authority (TTJA), require change.

Operail's sale of its Finnish subsidiary's assets, for approximately EUR 28 million was the best decision in the circumstances, he added, and the price obtained was a fair one.

Jankelevitsh is to take up a new post as a member of the board of the Phoenix Group, from February. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

“Check against delivery”

Dear Minister,

Dear guests,

It is a great pleasure for me to be in Tallinn today.

The eyes of the world are looking towards the East again. I remember in 1968, when I was growing up in the communist Czech Republic, I saw the Soviet tanks coming from the East. Today, Ukraine sees tanks, bombs, rockets and soldiers coming from the same place.

Russia is challenging not only the independence of Ukraine, not only the rule-based order and post-cold war security arrangement in Europe. Kremlin decided to challenge everything you, Estonians, and other Central and Eastern European countries fought for only a generation ago: peace, democracy and the rule of law.

Today, I want to talk to you about us, about Europe and what are the consequences for all of us of this brutal war.

To understand the present, it’s helpful to know the history. Just look at the walls of the building we are in. Today, this is the democratic ministry of foreign affairs. Yet, until 1989 this was the headquarter of the Estonian communist party. Everywhere in the Central and Eastern Europe, from Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius, Warsaw, Prague, and all the way to the Black Sea, the Soviet Union held its authoritarian grip on power. Some of you still remember, like I do, a few features of the Soviet system. It made critical thinking a crime, a treason. It aimed at killing hope that better life is possible. It wanted to spread fear, so we subdue and obey.

Luckily for our region, history has given us a chance to rebel and regain our freedom and independence.

Here, in Estonia, you sang the “your Songs” to demonstrate your courage. You created the Baltic Way, from here to Vilnius, just a year later. The power of music and holding hands was greater than a power of guns.

I am recalling that, because I see a certain tendency today. Those of us who felt the footprints of the Soviet boots on our land knew full well what Putin’s Russia is capable of. Those of us who rebelled against what seemed like an all-mighty Soviet Union also have had the courage to act in the most decisive way when it comes to the recent Russian aggression on Ukraine.

I am a Czech national, from the Velvet Revolution generation. And even though the distance to drive from Tallinn to Berlin is shorter than to Prague, history has bound us and other Central and Eastern European nations together. We used to be a Soviet sphere of influence, and later on called post-Communist countries or new democracies, and then finally, new Member States of the European Union.

Today, standing in front of you, I feel history wants to remind us of our common legacy. So, let me be blunt in my diagnosis: Estonia was right about Russia. Latvia, Lithuania and Poland were right about Russia. Some others were not.

I recall that until the invasion almost a year ago, every time I warned about the threat from Putin’s regime, there were those who called me a Russophobe. Yet, because I spoke the truth, the Kremlin banned me from ever visiting Russia. I wear this sanction as a badge of honour.

I don’t mention this to say “we told you so”. I am saying this, because today, the debate is still ongoing how to best react, how to help Ukraine, what arms and when to deliver it. And I want to say to those who hesitate: the Central and Eastern European nations told you what Putin is capable of and what he was going to do. So now, when in doubt, listen to their advice and follow their lead. Every minute of hesitation is costing lives.

There cannot be a talk about European sovereignty, if we cannot be decisive about security just behind our Eastern border. We, Europeans, should be leading these efforts.

Chancellor Scholz in Prague, in the grand hall of the Charles University, admitted that the “centre of gravity is moving eastwards”. I agree.

Today, the nations of Central and Eastern Europe have a historical and moral obligation to remove the mental label of the new Member States. We are sitting at the biggest democratic table in the world – the European Union. We must learn to speak in a way that others listen. We must get better in promoting our ideas and our vision of Europe on security, on defence, on economy and on enlargement.

Ladies and gentlemen,

I have looked briefly to the West of Tallinn. Now I want to look again to the East. The Kremlin is fighting its war not only with bombs, but also with words. Since the war started, the Kremlin has unleashed a tsunami of Propaganda.

But it has been engaged in disinformation and foreign influence long before that. They have never underestimated the power of free speech in the democratic world. This is why they forbid it at home. I don’t believe it is a coincidence that the first thing the Soviet troops did after Estonia proclaimed its independence on 20th of August 1991 was to attack the Tallina teletorn, the Tallinn TV Tower.

They knew back then, and they know full well today that information can be a powerful tool.

Estonian first president after regaining independence, Lennart Meri recognised this power in a speech he gave in Belgium in 1992. He said: “We, Estonians, lived in the broadcast range of Finnish television and so were able to recognize Lech Walesa by his moustache. In the Soviet Union this fact was a state secret, just as the fact that the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe were fighting for their human and civil rights”.

In fact, he thought this ability to speak and listen to the news from behind the Curtain made Estonians a nation of dissidents. I think he was right.

Russian state has engaged in the war of ideas to pollute our information space with half-truth and lies to create a false image that democracy is no better than autocracy.

Today, this is a multi-million euro weapon of mass manipulation aimed both internally at the Russians as well as at Europeans and the rest of the world.

We must say stop to this. We cannot close an eye to this. We have to fight back.

I want to pause for a minute about a difficult issue of the information war the Kremlin is waging on its own citizens.

I know there are voices, especially now, that say we should give up on all the Russians. They support the Kremlin, it is their choice.

I reject this argument, not because I am expert on Russian society, but because I have heard this argument before. This is what was said about the nations of Central and Eastern Europe during the Cold War. We were part of the price to pay for the so-called ‘stability’. Yet, there were those that did not give up on us. I remember to this day, when my parents were gathering around our radio to search and listen to the Radio Free Europe or Voice of America. I still feel the unspoken anxiety of these moments.

And I believe we should not give up on the Russian society as well, regardless of how few or how many want to hear the real news, not Kremlin propaganda.

My friend Andrus Ansip always quotes Carl Popper by saying that optimism is our moral duty.

I am convinced we have a moral obligation to support democratic ideals also in Russia. Not with weapons, but with words.

We must support those who want to fight against the tide and believe the Russian people ought to have a choice.

This is why I want to launch a Radio Free Russia project. This does not mean establishing a brand new radio station. The times are completely different than at the beginning of cold war when Radio Free Europe was created.

I want to support those who are doing a lot already, help them to create economy of scale and fill the gaps so they can produce more content and distribute it more widely without any editorial interference. I want to support the idea of people to have choice.

We have a unique opportunity now because many independent Russian journalists were expelled. The new Novaya Gazeta gets published in Riga. The hubs of Russian journalists and activists are now in the EU. We need to create the conditions for them to work and tell the story of the EU they see and experience to their Russian audiences. It is not only a moral duty, it is in our self-interest.

In the last part of the speech, I want to look at ourselves. We can only be credible in promoting democracy if our own house is in order.

We have to make our democracies more resilient and stronger, because unfortunately they are also under threat. And the threat level is rising.

A key aspect of democracy are free and fair elections the balance of powers. The idea is simple, that no one power, be it the government, the parliament or the courts, is too powerful, that they all balance each other.

This is why we are so determined to uphold the rule of law and react when we see systemic risks to the independence of judiciary.

This is why I proposed the European Democracy Action Plan only three years ago with its key pillars such as strengthening election integrity, fighting disinformation and promoting media freedom and pluralism.

This is why I want online platforms to become more transparent and accountable.

Fighting disinformation and promoting media freedom are two side of the same coin. We have proposed the Media Freedom Act that will enshrine, for the first time in EU law, common safeguards to protect media pluralism and the editorial independence of the media.

We have proposed the so-called anti-SLAPP directive to protect journalists and other human rights defenders from abusive lawsuits. And many other legislative and non-legislative initiatives.

All of these actions have one common goal: to strengthen those that mean well against those who want to abuse the power.

I count on Estonia and its government to support us in all the attempts to strengthen democracy in the EU as a whole and in each and every Member State.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I started this speech by saying that, to understand the present, it’s helpful to know the history. This sentence resonates strongly in this important day when we remember the millions of Jewish women, men and children, and all other victims, among them hundreds of thousands of Roma, murdered during the Holocaust.

Antisemitism led to the Holocaust but did not end with it. Antisemitism is again on the rise in Europe. So we need to continue the fight against it.

Peace, and democracy are not granted once at for all. Democracy needs defenders and it needs constant nurturing.

Our democracies are not perfect. We have to continue to fix the problems of the people.

But those of us who lived behind the Iron Curtain, those of us who understand the authoritarian playbook also used by Putin today, know that democracy is precious. Mainly because it offers rights to individuals and makes people equal before the law.

It offers us tools to control those in power and replace them if we are not satisfied.

Our objective is clear: make our democracies stronger and restore faith in those who start doubting it.

There is a saying that only those who lose something can know the real value of it. I realised this even more when I talked to young Ukrainians in Lviv last September, witnessing their hunger for being part of the European Union. The Ukrainians remind us that democracy is appealing. And that the EU, as a peace project, is probably the best guarantor of rights and freedoms humans have ever created.

Despite the risks, we will succeed, because our Union will be united not only by the value of the single market, but also with our values.

In short, we need to channel in our democracies the spirits of Lennart Meri and Václav Havel. They were both statesmen with a capital S. They both are founding fathers of Estonian and Czech democracies, respectively. They projected charisma and respect, also to their political opponents. They knew democracy is about building trust among each and every citizen, rather than sowing hate and undermining institutions.

I think we owe to these two gentlemen a greater attempt at being better democrats.

Thank you.

TALLINN, Feb 01, BNS – On Feb. 5, the transitional period of sanctions imposed by the European Union on oil products from the Russian Federation will end, and their purchase and import into the EU will be prohibited from Monday, Feb. 6.

"From February 6, it is forbidden to buy, import and transfer petroleum products if they originate in Russia. The list of prohibited goods also includes fuels used in motor vehicles. It is estimated that today, about 80 percent of passenger cars, in addition to the fuel in the car's standard fuel tank, also carry a 10-liter canister with fuel when a vehicle crosses the border into Estonia for the first time," Piret Tinkus, head of the prohibitions and restrictions service of the social protection field of the customs department of the Tax and Customs Board, said in a press release.

Pursuant to legislation, an EU resident has the right to buy fuel in Russia if it is necessary to complete the trip and return to the territory of the EU. This means that the passenger has the right to import into the EU fuel that is in the vehicle's standard fuel tank and intended for use in the same vehicle.

"It is forbidden to bring into the European Union, in a fuel canister, fuel that has been bought in Russia, as such imports cannot be considered as meeting of basic needs, including the completion of a journey," said Tinkus, pointing out that the ban on importing goods in a canister applies to entry from Russia into all Baltic countries and Finland alike.

To the import of motor fuel in a standard fuel tank the restrictions on the tax-free import of fuel laid down in the Alcohol, Tobacco, Fuel and Electricity Excise Act and the VAT Act apply, meaning that the fuel in a standard fuel tank is tax-free upon first entry into Estonia. On all subsequent border crossings in the same calendar month the fuel is taxed, unless the passenger, when traveling from Estonia to Russia, has informed the customs that there is fuel in the vehicle's tank that they intend to bring back.

Pumping fuel out of a vehicle after crossing the border and handing it over for a fee or free of charge is considered a violation of the sanction. Pumping out is only allowed for the purpose of repair of the vehicle, if it is later pumped back into the vehicle.

Estonian FinMin proposes law amendment for better monitoring of sanctions

TALLINN, Feb 06, BNS – The Ministry of Finance proposed to the finance committee of the Estonian parliament to amend the Credit Institutions Act in such a way that a credit institution has the right to transmit bank secrecy information to the Tax and Customs Board in case of suspicion or threat of violation of the ban on the import and export of goods subject to international sanctions.

The ministry finds that, although the implementation of the ban on the import and export of goods subject to sanctions is currently checked primarily by the Tax and Customs Board, preventing the physical movement of the goods into or out of Estonia, credit institutions are also involved in the implementation of trade sanctions, which must check that the planned transactions of their customers do not violate a sanction.

"A credit institution may namely be the one to receive information about a planned prohibited import or export transaction first," Finance Minister Annely Akkermann said.

According to the currently valid law, upon detection of a risk of violation of a trade sanction, the credit institution rejects the corresponding payment and informs the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), but just as the credit institution does not have the right to transmit information containing bank secrecy and related to the international trade sanction to the Tax and Customs Board, neither does the FIU.

"Since, according to the Tax and Customs Board, various fraudulent methods are used to evade import and export bans, such as falsifying customs documents and providing false information about the origin of goods and the country of origin and destination, it is extremely important that if credit institutions have information about a possible planned prohibited import or export transaction, this information moves from the credit institution to Tax and Customs Board," Akkermann said, adding that, according to the FIU, in 2022 a fourth of the notifications of the application of international sanctions received from credit institutions were related to trade sanctions.

The minister pointed out that the Banking Association has also drawn attention to this significant gap in Estonian law, which serves as an obstacle to the effective implementation of international sanctions.

Based on the above, the minister finds that the regulation of bank secrecy should be supplemented in the Credit Institutions Act and a possibility should be provided by which credit institutions have the right to transmit information that is bank secrecy to the Tax and Customs Board in case of suspicion or threat of violation of the ban on the import and export of goods subject to international sanctions. Such information could be used by the tax authority during the supervision of the implementation of sanctions. According to the proposal, the tax authority could use data received from credit institutions, such as data identifying the originator of the payment or the payee or data about the payee's payment service provider, only for the purpose of monitoring international sanctions.

According to the minister, the volume of the monitoring of trade sanctions is illustrated by the Tax and Customs Board's 2022 customs control statistics, according to which the tax authority's sanctions monitoring following Russia's military aggression covers 66 percent of the volume of customs control. Violations of import and export bans of international sanctions have been identified in 1,500 cases, cases with characteristics corresponding to the crime of violation of international sanctions have been handed over to the Internal Security Service for processing.

The minister admitted that the relaxation of bank secrecy regulations must be considered very thoroughly.

"The legal regulation of bank secrecy is very strongly related to the prevailing values in society. Due to the continuous development of the information society and technology, it is possible to collect, process and analyze a huge amount of personal data, therefore certain frameworks are very necessary for the transmission of information considered as bank secrecy without the client's consent in cases prescribed by law. The transmission of bank secrecy to state authorities is justified in cases of significantly greater national and public interest, for example in the prevention of money laundering and terrorism, in criminal and tax proceedings or in the field of ensuring national security, when infringements on the basic rights of individuals are permitted and necessary in a democratic rule of law," Akkermann said.

According to her, such an approach is also supported by the practice of the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice.

ESTONIA: EU SANCTION BAN ON RUSSIAN PETROLEUM PRODUCTS NOT TO AFFECT ECONOMY

New European Union sanctions introduced at the weekend will limit the amount of petroleum products consumers can buy, import, and deliver from Russia. This will not have a big impact on the Estonian economy.

So far, restrictions have only applied to crude oil but these were widened on February 5.

Products that trade above the price of crude oil, such as diesel, gasoline and jet fuel, are capped at $100 per barrel and those trading below will have a ceiling of $45 per barrel, Politico Europe reports.

A person will only be able to bring a maximum of a car tank's worth of fuel back from Russia.

"From February 6, it is prohibited to buy, import and deliver petroleum products which originate in Russia," said Piret Tinkus, head of the prohibitions and restrictions division of the customs security area at the customs department of the Tax and Customs Board. "The list of prohibited goods also includes fuel used for consumption in motor vehicles. It is estimated that today, on the first crossing into Estonia, approximately 80% of passenger cars are accompanied by a 10-liter canister of fuel in addition to the fuel in the car's standard fuel tank."

A resident of the European Union has the right to purchase fuel from Russia, if it is necessary for completing the trip and returning to the territory of the European Union.

Tinkus said this meant that the driver had the right to import fuel that was in the vehicle's standard fuel tank and intended for use in the same vehicle.

"It is prohibited to bring fuel purchased from Russia in a fuel canister into the European Union, as it is not considered necessary for basic needs, including completion of the trip," she said.

The ban uniformly applies upon entering all Baltic countries and Finland from Russia.

Bank of Estonia's Peeter Luikmel said this was the first successful attempt to impose a price cap on Russian oil production, including diesel.

Luikmel believes the cap will be further reduced in the near future, pushing Russian trade negotiators into a difficult situation.

"Most importantly, the reality is that even those countries with which Russia still trades oil know quite clearly that price caps are in place, and are likely to be lowered in the coming months, and Russia is therefore finding it increasingly difficult to conclude long-term agreements with its so-called friendly countries," he said.

Estonia's economy will not be directly affected by the new sanctions as a ban on importing Russian oil products has been in effect for domestic companies since December 2022. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

ESTONIA Tallinn's solidarity with Ukraine is influenced by the fear it could be next, reports Rob Hastings

In most places, a riverside walk is an ideal way to forget the world's troubles for a few moments. Not so in the Estonian city of Narva. Across the water from its promenade, less than 150 metres away, is Russia.

For people living in Narva, it must be hard to forget they're on the frontier between the EU and Vladimir Putin's regime. Staring at them on the other side of the river are the imposing walls of a 15th-century fortress named after the first Russian leader to ever call himself a tsar: Ivan the Great.

It's the city with the most ethnically Russian population in the EU - amounting to four in every five people - and 97 per cent of citizens speak Russian. It's nearer St Petersburg than the Estonian capital, Tallinn. In the summer Putin even tried to use Moscow's past conquest of Narva to explain and justify his invasion of Ukraine.

These historical and cultural links to Russia, intensified by sheer geographical proximity, sum up why Estonia is so wary of its giant neighbour right now - and why it's urging Nato allies, including the UK, to strengthen their military power and offer Kyiv greater support.

The Baltic state won freedom from Moscow's rule twice in the 20th century: first from Bolshevik Russia in 1918, then from the Soviet Union in 1991. But its annual independence day on 24 February will have extra significance this year, coincidentally marking the first anniversary of Putin sending his tanks into Ukraine.

"We are happy that we are independent, that we can celebrate and be proud of our identity," Estonia's foreign minister, Urmas Reinsalu, says. "At the same time, of course, we are aware of the atrocities taking place literally one hour's flight time from our capital."

Now aged 47, Reinsalu (inset) was a 16-year-old schoolboy living in Tallinn when Estonia broke away from a collapsing USSR. "People were so excited," he recalls. "It was a period of awakening, of feeling our national pride again, after spending almost two generations under occupation."

This year, Tallinn will be filled with yellow and blue flags. For all Estonia's ties to Russia, the country now feels a greater brotherhood with Ukraine. "We were in the same prison of nations, in the USSR," says Reinsalu. "We both suffered from Soviet aggression."

Speaking to me via video link, Reinsalu explains that the building he's sitting in, the Estonian foreign ministry, used to be one of the main Communist headquarters in Tallinn. Where an abstract painting now hangs on the wall, there used to be an image of Lenin.

"Combined with Nazi occupation, we lost one fifth of our population [in the Second World War], so we know the price of freedom very well," he says. "Instinctively,

Estonian people have the strongest sympathy with Ukrainian people, and we are under no illusions about the intent or modus operandi of Russian troops."

STANDING UP TO PUTIN In Narva, even ethnic Russians who previously felt traditional loyalties to the Kremlin have been thinking again. In August the government removed a Soviet T-34 tank from a plinth in the city, along with other monuments dating back to Stalin's occupation of the country.

The invasion of Ukraine has "united society and also politics", says Reinsalu. "We debated about ending Russian language lessons in our schools for a generation. Now, we just passed the law within months."

Moscow has accused Tallinn of "Russophobia" and ordered Estonia's ambassador to leave last month, Russia's first expulsion of a chief diplomat since the invasion of Ukraine.

Reinsalu is very clear, however, that his nation's mood of solidarity with Ukraine and defiance towards Russia isn't just about history. It's about fears of what Putin could do next.

"If the outcome of the war, by unimaginable horror, will be somehow interpreted as a Russian victory, or even ambivalent, it is an existential threat to us," he says. "We invest all our diplomatic, economic and military support for Ukrainian victory.

"There is no alternative strategy. The borders of countries in Europe can't be changed by the might of tanks [rolling into] the neighbours of Russia."

Estonia is thankful that, unlike Ukraine, it is a member of Nato. It joined the alliance in 2004 together with six other countries from the former Eastern bloc. That means any military attack on its soil would be considered an attack on all Nato members, including the UK and US, and would lead to group retaliation.

British troops have been among those taking part in multinational exercises in Estonian forests this month, and the Defence Secretary Ben Wallace flew to Tallinn in

January to issue a new joint pledge of support to Ukraine.

None of this has stopped online warfare from across the border, says Reinsalu: "We get, on a very systematic basis, cyber attacks coming from Russian soil." These are "intensive and continuous", he says, and "intend to harm us". So far, no significant damage is known to have occurred.

No doubt the Kremlin would claim it has nothing to do with these, and Reinsalu says he "will not make a legal attribution".

But he adds: "If they are coming from Russian soil, I'm under no illusions that they are not centrally orchestrated. It's interesting to see that we get the attacks in connection with our political decisions. For example, one of the biggest attacks was right after the Estonian parliament declared Russia a terrorist regime."

MILITARY BOOSTS Estonia may be a nation of just 1.3 million people - around the same population as Glasgow and its surrounding suburbs - but it is leading from the front.

Last year it set a target of devoting 1 per cent of its entire GDP to military support for Ukraine; it achieved that aim in January. The sum amounts to about half of its entire defence budget.

"We should change our paradigm of Ukrainian support, to give as much as Ukraine needs to help it win and make a game-changer on the battlefield," Reinsalu says.

"All this last year, step-by-step decisions to upgrade our military support have taken too long. Who is paying for that? All of mankind, because it prolongs the war. The currency being paid is the blood of Ukrainian martyrs."

Europe has to reckon with the guilt of not supporting Ukraine fully enough and early enough, he argues.

"Let us imagine if maybe one half or one quarter of the weapons we have already given had been on Ukrainian soil before 24 February last year, or if what we've given had all been in Ukraine in the spring of last year… We can't change the past, but we can learn from it. This upgrading is not speedy enough."

Estonia's diplomats are reportedly lobbying for Nato members to increase their defence spending targets from 2 per cent of GDP to 2.5 or even 3 per cent, a level Tallinn is now aiming for itself.

As for any future dealings with Putin himself, Reinsalu says: "He's lacking any human empathy, for what he sees as an enemy nation but also towards his own people… Putin deserves his place in the panopticon of the biggest criminals against humanity in the history of mankind."

A few brave Russian dissidents have sacrificed their freedom and their health, and in some cases lost their lives, in opposing Putin. But the Estonian foreign minister believes that this does not excuse the country's population as a whole in allowing such a man to gradually take control of their nation over the past 25 years, culminating in the invasion of Ukraine.

"The passivity of Russian society has given a momentum and legitimisation to Putin's regime to turn from authoritarian towards totalitarian," he argues. "The Russian people bear responsibility." For this reason, he opposes Russian athletes being allowed to compete at the Paris Olympics next year.

Reinsalu is relieved, at least, that there have been no "significant provocations" in Narva or anywhere else along the country's 183-mile border with Russia in the past year.

"We have limited border crossings of Russian citizens, and other countries in our region who have a land border with Russia have joined that effort," he says. "Goods are moving under the restrictions of sanction regime, but wider interaction between the countries could be described as frozen."

After being stuck behind the Iron Curtain throughout the Cold War during Soviet occupation, Estonia is glad to be part of the West these days - and will hope the situation along its border does not heat up.

Estonia’s incumbent centre-right Estonian Reform Party (Eesti Reformierakond; Reform) won 31% of the vote in the general election held on 5 March. The party increased its parliamentary representation from 34 to 37 seats in the 101-seat parliament, according to provisional election results.

* Reform almost certainly will lead the next coalition government, which is likely to include at least three parties and be voted in by mid-April. Led by the current Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, as the largest party Reform will receive the mandate to form a majority coalition, which requires at least 51 seats. Six parties entered parliament versus five in the previous election in 2019. If inter-party negotiations, which will probably be concluded within March, lead to the reconstitution of the current three-party ruling majority comprising Reform, the national-conservative Fatherland (Isamaa), and the centre-left Social Democrats (Sotsiaaldemokraatlik Erakond: SDE), such a coalition would have 54 seats. The progressive-liberal Estonia 200 (Eesti 200) party entered parliament for the first time, obtaining 14 seats. Eesti 200’s strong EU and NATO support and liberal orientation also makes it a likely coalition partner for Reform, a strong NATO and EU proponent. Reform is likely to seek to form a broader coalition of at least three parties to obtain a clearer majority above the minimum required seats. Reform has specified that it will not form a coalition with the far-right Conservative People’s Party of Estonia (Eesti Konservatiivne Rahvaerakond: EKRE), which obtained 17 seats. The EKRE has been critical of the Reform-led government’s renewable energy plans and its policy towards Ukraine, including sending weapons and hosting refugees. The inclusion of the centre-left Centre party (Keskerakond; Centre) in a Reform-led government is also unlikely, given the breakdown of the Reform-Centre governing coalition in June 2022.

* Strong policy continuity is likely, including continued focus on increasing defence spending and investing in the country’s energy diversification efforts. Irrespective of the final coalition configuration, Reform is likely to drive most key policy initiatives. Given the policy alignment between potential coalition members, the government is likely to maintain its prior policy objective to increase spending on defence and is very likely also to continue to focus on energy diversification, including renewable energy. In 2023, defence spending is projected by the government to rise to 2.9% of GDP compared with an estimated 2.1% in 2022 (see Estonia: 27 October 2022: Estonia’s 2023 budget continues its expansionary fiscal stance[https://connect.ihsmarkit.com/master-viewer/show/phoenix/4564411?connectPath=RiskHeadlineAnalysis&searchSessionId=4f3c3b0f-77ee-4ebe-8c8b-8b12b35d482e]). Funding and regulatory support for renewable energy policies and projects is likely to be maintained. Estonian parliamentary parties, especially Reform, have generally been in favour of a sound and fiscally conservative policy stance and the country has a pre-COVID-19 pandemic record of budgetary surpluses. A Reform-led government is likely to aim to work towards reducing the fiscal deficit in the two-year outlook from a structural budget deficit of 2.6% in 2023, as projected by S&P Global Market Intelligence. <img src="/images/phoenix/4668406_NDY2ODYwM18wLjIueGxzeF9TaGVldDJfQ2hhcnQgMg==.png"></img>

<img src="/images/phoenix/4668406_NDY2ODYwM18wLjIueGxzeF9TaGVldDNfQ2hhcnQgMw==.png"></img>

* Policy continuity would imply strong support for EU sanctions against Russia, and funding and military support to Ukraine. A Reform-led government is very likely to continue to drive along with Poland’s and Lithuania’s calls for expanded EU sanctions against Russia and stronger sanction enforcement, as well as EU financial and military support to Ukraine. Estonia is also likely to continue the development of a framework to allow the usage of Russian assets for reconstruction in Ukraine, having already started work in this area under the prior Reform-led administration (see Europe: 17 February 2023: EU’s 10th sanction package proposal against Russia likely to be adopted, affecting technology, industrial goods exports, banking[https://connect.ihsmarkit.com/document/show/phoenix/4653000?connectPath=RiskHeadlineAnalysis&searchSessionId=8a8e3729-6551-4174-9382-0356668708a6]).

Indicators of changing risk environment

* Eesti 200 joining the government would increase the likelihood of more state support for small-scale and innovative green community projects.

* The SDE’s continued inclusion in a Reform-led government would increase the likelihood that social spending would be maintained in the two-year outlook, reducing the likelihood of more fiscally prudent policies.

* Coalition negotiations extending beyond March would indicate key differences among the potential coalition partners potentially around social and tax policy, and increase government instability risks for any future coalition.

Tallinn, Estonia -

Weeks after U.S. Ambassador to Estonia George Kent took up his new post in the country, he spoke to VOA about the future of U.S.-Estonia relations, how Russia's invasion of Ukraine has affected attitudes toward defense spending, and military cooperation, as well as NATO expansion.

Kent is a career member of the Senior Foreign Service and previously served as deputy assistant secretary in the European and Eurasian bureau at the U.S. State Department. He was also the former deputy chief of mission in Kyiv, Ukraine. He joined the U.S. Foreign Service in 1992.

Kent spoke this week with VOA Eastern Europe bureau chief Myroslava Gongadze in Tallinn, Estonia.

[See removed content in original press release.]

This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

VOA: You arrived in Estonia when the biggest war since World War II - Russia's war in Ukraine - started. And this country, in particular, has experienced Soviet occupation. How does the past occupation of Estonia change Estonians' assessment or their view of this threat from Russia?

Kent: Well, you can see this is the Victims of Communism Memorial. It was built in 2018, and Estonians - who were about a million Estonians before the war - lost 75,000 people through being shot and killed in exile in Siberia. And another estimated 90,000 who were forced into refugee status. So, a country that's relatively small lost 20% of its population between roughly 1940 and 1955. So, I think that experience of Estonians ... experiencing Soviet oppression made them empathetic to what was happening to Ukrainians, particularly over the last year.

VOA: Clearly, the Eastern Europeans are more in tune with these threats, and it seems as if they understand them better. Why do you think it's such a big difference between Eastern and Western Europe?

Kent: I think Estonians have lived the threat. They are neighbors of Russia, and so I think it's not hypothetical for Estonians. So, for others who are further away, it's almost a clinical international relations challenge. And for Estonians, it's both the lived experience of their families, as well as the actual threat right on their borders. And so, for instance, I was given this Ukrainian-colored ribbon at the Estonian National Day [commemoration]. As we went in for the commemoration of Estonia's independence in 1918, everybody was given a Ukrainian ribbon, because for Estonians, they really see the events of today through the lens of their own past.

VOA: In your previous capacity, you were in charge of the U.S. policy toward the region. Had you foreseen that something like this could happen in this region?

Kent: I think many people heard but did not listen to the words of Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Russians. They were talking about wanting to expand Russia's territory - the previous lands that were under the Russian empire - and I believe most Westerners thought we are in a different era, that we have a rules-based international order. There are commitments that both Soviet and Russian leaders signed up to, and perhaps we all should have been listening more closely to what Russians were actually saying.

VOA: The U.S. and Estonia have a close relationship, obviously, and Estonia is a front-line country. The U.S. and NATO are helping Estonia boost its military capability. How well is this process going?

Kent: Secretary of Defense [Lloyd] Austin was here three weeks ago, and his messages, I think, were direct and quite relevant to your question. First of all, Estonia has given more assistance per capita to Ukraine than any other country. Second of all, Secretary Austin said he promised the previous Estonian governments were Russia to invade Ukraine more broadly, we, the U.S., would be sending troops to Estonia the next day. And it was a small group, but they were dispatched the next day. Last December, we sent a HIMARS unit and an infantry company here to Estonia. That was our implementation of the commitments made at the NATO Madrid Summit last year. And leading up to the Vilnius Summit in July, we're in active discussions led by the NATO Supreme Commander Chris Cavoli about new regional plans. So, I think the events, Russia's wider invasion and war in Ukraine, are also driving considerations within NATO, as well as the discussions between the U.S. and Estonia bilaterally.

VOA: Ukrainian intelligence is assessing that Russia is running out of ammunition, and there is a possibility of China joining forces with Russia in its war in Ukraine. How dangerous can this be?

Kent: I think there's a lot of coverage around the Munich Security Conference. The U.S. clearly has been messaging to Chinese leaders that they should stay out, not support Russia materially in this war. And I think it's pretty clear that the U.S. has a willingness to sanction those who support Russia's war effort. And there were a series of announcements on February 24th, which was the anniversary of the wider invasion, both additional security and assistance, particularly financial assistance that Secretary of State [Antony] Blinken announced, but also a series of sanctions against Russia, against individuals involved in the war effort, involved in what we consider are crimes against humanity. But also sanctions against financial, military, technology and energy sector companies. So, I think that is a very firm signal that the U.S. will sanction those who are involved in supporting Russia's war effort, whether they're Russians or other countries.

VOA: Russia is making threats of using its nuclear capabilities. Again, Ukrainian intelligence leadership say that nuclear has a more deterrent effect than real weapons and real threats. How would you, and American intelligence, assess the possibility of Russia using nuclear capabilities, and how could this affect the region?

Kent: The rhetoric of threats dates back to really the dawn of the nuclear age. Nuclear weapons have never been used, even though leaders of the Soviet Union, now Russia, threaten the potential use. So, I think people need to keep that in perspective. We have a long history of remaining calm, and that's the right approach. There were horrific pictures over the weekend of the latest town which Russia has completely destroyed - Marinka - and many people were comparing what Marinka looks now to [how] Hiroshima did after use of a nuclear weapon.

In essence, Russia has been using conventional means to achieve the same effect, and I think that's something also to consider, given the death of Ukrainian civilians in Mariupol, the total destruction of many cities by Russian artillery. I think Ukrainians have sent the signal that they are going to continue to fight for their country, for their survival, and the U.S. will remain calm and not respond to those sorts of verbal threats.

ESTONIA: TRADE WITH CENTRAL ASIAN COUNTRIES UP IN 2022

Trade between Estonia and countries in Central Asia, such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, grew abruptly last year. For example, goods export to Kyrgyzstan grew more than 50-fold. The government does not know to what extent this constitutes bypassing Russian sanctions.

Estonian exports to Kazakhstan amounted to EUR 11 million before the Russia-Ukraine war in 2021, but grew 6-fold during the first war year, to EUR 78 million. The tendency can be observed regarding other countries close to Russia. The value of goods exported to Kyrgyzstan grew 55-fold, 19-fold for Armenia and 1.3-fold for Uzbekistan.

Exports to Kazakhstan included agricultural machinery and vehicle spare parts, which cannot be exported to Russian due to Western sanctions. Cars also topped the list of exports to Kyrgyzstan. Goods move from Estonia to Central Asian countries largely through Russia, either by truck or train.

This spike in export volumes can also be observed in Finland. The value of goods exported from Finland to Kyrgyzstan grew eight times, the Finnish public broadcaster Yle reported in early March.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) published a report in late February according to which the export volume of goods EU countries and the U.K. export to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia and that were subject to Russia sanctions grew by 30% more compared to unsanctioned goods.

The report also points out that the export growth doesn't come close to offsetting the drop in the trade between Russia and the West.

Toomas Tirs, Estonia's ambassador to Central Asia, said that the West had no idea how much of goods sent to Central Asia ended up in Russia as it was very difficult to ascertain.

"These are massive countries. The border between Kazakhstan and Russia runs for over 7,500 kilometers. We have no way to monitor it, while the EU and USA are engaged in constant dialogue with the authorities in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Official data are exchanged and analyzed. Specific concerns are voiced, concerning computer chips, for example, and transparency sought to make sure these do not end up in Russia. We might see a reaction at some point. For example, that the U.S. will sanction certain Central Asian companies for reselling certain technologies, while this is, again, a matter of speculation," Tirs said.

Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Belarus and Armenia all belong to the Eurasian Economic Union and goods move easily between them.

Tirs remarked that Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan had both clearly stated that they were not facilitating the bypassing of sanctions and were working with Western countries.

"Central Asia has been clear in terms of not supporting efforts to circumvent sanctions. What might happen is that individuals or SMEs go to a wholesaler, buy ten washing machines or iPhones, put them in their van and drive to Russia. There is nothing stopping them from doing that, as the goods have been legally declared in Kazakhstan and taken to a sales point. Or a family comes over from Russia, discovers new iPhones on sale, buys several of them, including for friends for which they then collect a small cut," Tirs explained.

Ambassador Tirs said that a part of increased trade was also down to the fact that while some brand goods, for example, clothing by Zara, were taken to Central Asia from central warehouses in Russia before the war, countries had been looking for ways to deliver goods straight from Estonia, also by using Estonian carriers, since then.

"We have an Estonian company that carries Swedish technology. Russia was its main market before the war. That business ended, while the company knew its Central Asian customers were buying from Russian warehouses. The firm is now active in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, selling its Swedish goods directly. It is not easy, of course, as the parent company, Estonian customs and tax authorities all work to make sure the goods actually end up in Kazakhstan," he said. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

TALLINN, Mar 20, BNS - Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu had a phone call with Foreign Minister of the Republic of Moldova Nicu Popescu on Saturday and reaffirmed Estonia's support for Moldova's constitutional order and sovereignty.

Popescu briefed Reinsalu on the situation in the country and Moldova's security assistance needs. Reinsalu said Estonia was ready to help Moldova and assured that Estonia would raise the issue of Moldova at the meeting of EU foreign ministers on Monday.

"Estonia has observed the repeated attempts of the Russian Federation to destabilize the Republic of Moldova and undermine the country's democratic institution. We are watching the situation in Moldova closely and treating the developments there with utmost seriousness," he added.

Reinsalu also underlined that the EU should establish a separate sanctions mechanism for stopping oligarchs who act as Russia's agents of influence.

"In our view, Russia’s attempts to destabilize the Republic of Moldova have a considerable impact on European security. This is why a sanctions mechanism is needed urgently to allow us to sanction individuals who are destabilizing the situation in Moldova," the Estonian foreign minister said.

Estonia continues to contribute to Moldova's security through various development cooperation projects, both bilaterally and via the European Peace Facility, which selected Estonian agencies for implementing its measures. Moldova has been a priority country for Estonia's development cooperation since 2006, with Estonia's contribution exceeding 10 million euros. This year, the development cooperation budget is 440,000 euros and the main priority is to support Moldova with actions needed for EU accession.

TALLINN, Mar 20, BNS - The EU Foreign Affairs Council gave its political approval on Monday to Estonia's initiative to jointly send one million artillery shells to Ukraine within 12 months.

Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu welcomed the EU's agreement in principle to give Ukraine one million artillery shells as part of a joint procurement within 12 months.

"Ukraine urgently needs additional ammunition to defend itself and the security of Europe," he said, adding that the EU's political decision is an important step in protecting the security of Ukraine and of all Europe. The decision will be concluded later on Monday by EU defense and foreign affairs ministers at a joint meeting.

The EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting also addressed holding Russia accountable for its crimes in Ukraine.

"It is the moral obligation of the international community to hold Russian leaders accountable," Reinsalu said, and welcomed the International Criminal Court's decision from last week to issue arrest warrants against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova.

The Estonian foreign minister added that in addition, the EU needs to rapidly develop a joint position in order to make progress on a UN mandate in the creation of an international tribunal and prevent Russia going unpunished. Reinsalu also highlighted the importance of proceeding with an 11th package of sanctions against Russia, and underscored that in addition to imposing new sanctions, it is equally as important to ensure that Russia cannot circumvent existing ones.

"On top of additional sanctions, we also rapidly need to lower the price cap on oil because Russia is using the profit to finance its war in Ukraine," he said.

"We need to jointly establish in the EU sanctions against the people who were involved in the unlawful arrest of journalist and opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza," Reinsalu said. He added that the EU additionally also needs to create a separate sanction mechanism against the Russian oligarchs who act as proxy agents of Russia in Moldova.

The ministers also discussed the EU's strategic compass, situation in Tunisia, human rights violations in Iran and Iran's support to Russia's aggression against Ukraine.

Ahead of the EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting, Reinsalu spoke at the European Humanitarian Forum, saying that Russia's aggression has caused a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and aggravated humanitarian aid needs globally.

"Estonia continues to make every effort to help ensure the necessary humanitarian aid and to stand up for compliance with the international humanitarian law," he said.

(Adds paras 4-9)

TALLINN, Mar 20, BNS - The EU Foreign Affairs Council as well as a joint meeting of EU defense and foreign affairs ministers gave their political approval on Monday to Estonia's initiative to jointly send one million 155-millimeter artillery shells to Ukraine within 12 months.

Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu welcomed the EU's agreement in principle to give Ukraine one million artillery shells as part of a joint procurement within 12 months.

"Ukraine urgently needs additional ammunition to defend itself and the security of Europe," he said, adding that the EU's political decision is an important step in protecting the security of Ukraine and of all Europe.

The agreement will now be forwarded to the European Council for approval on March 23-24.

Estonian Minister of Defense Hanno Pevkur said that the aim of the initiative from Estonia is to provide Ukraine with urgently needed military aid as fast as possible and increase the European defense industry's manufacturing capabilities.

"Above all, Ukraine needs ammunition right now and today we put the clear objective in writing -- to send at least one million 155 mm caliber rounds of ammunition to Ukraine within the next 12 months,” Pevkur explained.

In addition to the political agreement, it now must be ensured that the mechanism chosen for carrying out the joint procurement is capable of meeting the objectives.

"Today’s agreement is only the beginning. To see it through, we need consistency and persistence, closer coordination and, of course, additional funding. For that, we fully support the proposal for an additional 3.5 billion euros to the European Peace Facility from member states," Pevkur added.

The agreement will be financed through the European Peace Facility. Its initial capacity was eight billion euros, however, in December 2022 the EU member states decided on an additional two billion euros to be allocated to the fund. In addition, member states agreed in December that the facility's budget will be increased by a maximum of 5.5, billion until the year 2027.

The EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting also addressed holding Russia accountable for its crimes in Ukraine.

"It is the moral obligation of the international community to hold Russian leaders accountable," Reinsalu said, and welcomed the International Criminal Court's decision from last week to issue arrest warrants against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova.

ESTONIA: CUSTOMS BOARD DETECTS 3,000 ATTEMPTS TO BREACH RUSSIAN SANCTIONS

Since Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine began last February, the Estonian Tax and Customs Board has identified around 3,000 attempts by private individuals and legal entities to circumvent the sanctions imposed in response.

The Estonian Tax and Customs Board has inspected more than 53,000 shipments of goods since Russia began its full-scale military invasion of Ukraine last February. In that time, the board has identified around 3,000 attempts to breach the sanctions. The statistics include Estonian citizens and companies as well as citizens from other EU member states.

Kulli Kurvits, head of the customs department at the Estonian Tax and Customs Board, told ERR radio, that when it came to private individuals there were two sanctions in particular that had been most commonly breached.

"For private individuals, we can say that the ban on carrying cash out of the country is often violated. There are a huge number of cases of non-compliance with the ban on the export of cash in euros from the European Union," Kurvits said.

Last year, the tax authorities detected around 200 such transgressions. The sums of money, which people were seeking to take out of the country, mostly ranged from a few thousand up to tens of thousands of euros.

In addition to attempts to flout restrictions on removing cash from the country, individuals have also fallen foul of the rules regarding the transportation of luxury items across the border.

"For example, very often people want to export expensive wines or champagne as well as different kinds of technical equipment. These are all covered by the ban on exporting luxury goods," Kurvits said.

"Private individuals have also tried to breach of the ban on the export of cars," she added.

Among the offences committed by legal entities, Kurvits pointed to infringements of the ban on the export of machinery and mechanical appliances.

"The prices of goods are different and therefore the orders of magnitude are also different. We might be talking about thousands of euros in some case, but also (in other cases) millions of euros," she explained.

Kurvits said, that 1,500 sanction violations were detected between the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February and the end of 2022. However, the same number of violations already was identified in the first three of months of this year alone.

Kurvits added, that 171 individuals and 65 legal entities were currently subject to entry restrictions as well as those regarding the freezing and availability of funds.

Last year, Estonia's Financial Intelligence Unit authorized 96 exemptions to the sanctions. Most were issued for the export of fertilizers from the ports of Muuga and Sillamae.

Due to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, Western countries have imposed a series of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, as well as frozen assets belonging to certain individuals and legal entities. On March 13, the measures already in force were extended by a further six months, to September 15. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

ISS: Russian media personality detained on suspicion of violating sanctions fled Estonia

TALLINN, Apr 12, BNS - The Internal Security Service (ISS) writes in its latest annual review that Elena Cherysheva, a Russian media personality who was detained in April 2022 on suspicion of violating an international sanction and a sanction imposed by the Estonian government, fled Estonia and is currently working for the media in the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.

"At the end of 2019, Sputnik Estonia, the local branch of Rossiya Segodnya, ceased operations in Estonia as a result of the European Union sanctions imposed on Dmitry Kiselyov, a major figure in Russian media propaganda and the head of the Russian state news agency Rossiya Segodnya. The former manager of Sputnik Estonia, Elena Cherysheva, and her husband, Mati-Dmitri Terestal, then founded the NGO Sprut Meedia, and in 2020, they launched a news website similar to the banned Sputnik Estonia, named Sputnik Meedia," the ISS writes.

According to the ISS, Cherysheva and Terestal were detained in April 2022 on suspicion of violating an international

sanction and a sanction imposed by the Estonian government. The Office of the Prosecutor General requested Cherysheva’s arrest, which the court did not grant. Elena Cherysheva was banned from leaving her residence but began to violate the ban in late 2022. On Dec. 30, 2022, a court order was issued for her arrest.

According to public sources, Elena Cherysheva is currently working for the media in the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine. In 2022, several more Russian activists, whose activities the ISS had assessed as damaging to Estonia’s security, left Estonia for Russia. Elena Cherysheva has been sought by the Police and Border Guard Board since January 2023.

Chief State Prosecutor Taavi Pern said in April 2022 that the criminal case was launched over suspected economic relations that have been banned with international sanctions.

"The European Union has established international sanctions due to the international crimes committed against the Ukrainian state and people. Violating these sanctions is a crime against peace," he said.

"The content published on the portal will not be assessed in these criminal proceedings," Pern said.

Estonia's ISS: Efforts to circumvent sanctions increasing

TALLINN, Apr 12, BNS - According to the Internal Security Service (ISS), attempts to circumvent the sanctions imposed on aggressor state Russia are increasing and this problem is especially relevant in the border countries, including Estonia.

In cooperation with its European partners, the ISS has observed increasing efforts by Russia to obscure supply chains where Russia is the final recipient of various goods. For this purpose, networks of legitimate companies controlled by Russia have been set up in Europe and Asia. This is why the transit countries along the Russian border, such as Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Finland, must work meticulously to prevent sanctions violations, detect the illegal exports of goods and handle any identified violations.

The Estonian authorities, with their partners, are working to ensure any technology that can support Russia’s military and economic capabilities does not transit through our region to Russia, the ISS writes in its latest annual review. At the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the ISS is represented in the Strategic Goods Commission, which in 2022 saw a sharp increase in the intensity of its work.

"The sanctions that came into effect following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine led to increased consultations and reduced the transport of strategic goods to Russia. The enforcement of import and export sanctions on Russia is supervised by the Estonian Tax and Customs Board, while KAPO is responsible for the preliminary investigation of intentional sanctions violations. Both agencies have come across sanction evasion schemes in the course of their work," the ISS writes.

According to the ISS, there are also deliberate attempts to misdeclare goods and to smuggle in prohibited luxury products among permitted goods. The capacity of the customs checkpoints in countries bordering Russia is being tested to identify weak points where prohibited goods can be transported across the border.

"Increasingly longer lists of prohibited goods, numerous exceptions to the sanctions and the novelty of the whole situation have posed a serious challenge for the frontline agencies implementing the sanctions. However, they have successfully adapted to the new situation over the past year, and having a common objective has further strengthened cooperation between the public and private sectors. Attempts to circumvent the sanctions are an indication of the impact they are having on Russia as a whole, as well as on the sanctioned individuals," the ISS adds.

The changed attitude of companies operating in the European Union has also helped ensure sanctions compliance. Many large corporations no longer want to do business with Russia due to the sanctions and reputational considerations. Some Estonian companies particularly stand out for carefully adhering to the sanctions. They screen out potential business partners whose activities differ from the norm and who appear to seek sanctioned goods for

their illegal delivery to Russia. Communicating with manufacturers of technology of interest to Russia and implementing know-your-customer policies certainly play a major role in identifying any attempts to evade sanctions.

According to the ISS, Europe’s vigilance regarding supplies to Russia means that customers related to the Russian military industry increasingly need to purchase the necessary components through third countries. In the past, Russian military procurement often used a scheme whereby a Russian scientific or educational institute was shown as the end user. With the new sanctions in place, attempts are being made to hide any connections with Russia and the final use of the goods there. This leads to an increased risk of goods being diverted through third countries.

Against the background of Russian aggression in 2022, China’s consistent efforts to strengthen its global economic footprint cannot be ignored. The ISS continues to monitor possible hidden Russian capital in Estonia and the Chinese authorities’ possible channeling of investment into the country.

TALLINN, Apr 27, BNS - On Thursday, Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna was in Chisinau for a joint visit with his Nordic and Baltic colleagues (NB8), where he affirmed that Moldova's stability and European integration are a priority.

The foreign ministers had meetings with Moldovan Foreign Minister Nicu Popescu, Prime Minister Dorin Recean, President Maia Sandu and Speaker of the Parliament Igor Grosu, spokespeople for the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.

The focus of the meetings was on Moldova's integration with the European Union and the reforms that are needed in the process. Tsahkna said Moldova had clearly expressed its ambition of joining the EU and it can count on Estonia’s support.

"This step is very important for European security; there is no room for grey areas," the minister underlined. NB8 foreign ministers recognized the representatives of Moldova for the progress made so far and said it was important to continue with an active reform agenda. Tsahkna said that Estonia would like to share its reform experience with colleagues in Moldova.

"Moldova is a neighbor of Ukraine and bears the greatest impact of the consequences of Russia's aggression. Obviously, Russia's aggression affects them immediately here and it is impressive how the Moldovan society has successfully met these challenges, including a large number of refugees," the Estonian foreign minister said.

Discussions also covered a new sanctions regime that would make it possible to sanction individuals and organizations that support the Kremlin and are actively trying to destabilize Moldova. The ministers highlighted the speedy launch of the EU civilian mission in Moldova, which would also concentrate on reinforcing internal security.

"Estonia fully supports the establishment of the EU civilian mission in Moldova and we are ready to contribute with our experts," Tsahkna said. This year, Estonia’s development cooperation budget for Moldova is 440,000 euros, aimed at supporting activities necessary for joining the European Union.

After the meetings, NB8 foreign ministers signed a joint declaration expressing their commitment to advancing freedom and democracy in Moldova and upholding Moldova's independence and sovereignty.

It is the first joint visit of NB8 states to Moldova. The aim of the visit was to show common Nordic and Baltic political support to the Europe-aligned foreign policy course of Moldova.

Estonia: Russian, Belarusian students, researchers, doctors granted exception to sanction

TALLINN, May 18, BNS - The Estonian government has approved an exception to a sanction which permits the citizens of Russia and Belarus who are either students, researchers or doctors and have come to Estonia prior to the start of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine to apply for a new residence permit.

The exception having been made in the sanction does not mean that applicants will automatically get a new residence permit, government spokespeople said, adding that each application will be weighed separately together with the applicant's basis for receiving a new residence permit.

Narrow exceptions will be made in the sanction for Russian and Belarusian students, doctors, dentists and academic workers with a legal basis for staying in Estonia and they will be granted the opportunity to apply for a new residence permit to prolong their stay.

The exceptions in the sanction concern people who came to Estonia for the purpose of study or work before the start of Russia's military aggression in Ukraine and who have passed all the necessary Estonian language examinations or completed an Estonian-language curriculum and have at least level B2 Estonian language proficiency. The language requirement does not apply to academic workers.

There are a total of 298 citizens of Russia and Belarus studying in higher education establishments in Estonia in the 2022-2023 academic year to whom the sanction applies. The planned exception first and foremost applies to the 78 people graduating from an Estonian-language curriculum.

The creation of an exception for students who speak Estonian and have graduated from a higher education establishment here does not conflict with the main objective of the sanction, which is to restrict the arrival of Russian and Belarusian citizens to Estonia, as the exception only concerns the people who are already here.

According to information from the Health Board, from 2022 to 2023, nine doctors from Russia and six from Belarus as well as one Russian and three Belarusian dentists have been registered as working in health care in Estonia.

The Ministry of Social Affairs said that all doctors and dentists who have come to work in Estonia, passed the relevant professional and language examinations, and whose right to work as a doctor or dentist has been entered into the Health Board's register, must be permitted to stay here regardless of their country of origin.

There are also three academic workers in Estonian higher education establishments who fall under the target group for the exception, according to the Ministry of Education and Research. Their basis for staying in Estonia is temporary and their visa was granted after the start of Russia's full-scale aggression but before the stricter sanctions were established.

ESTONIA: EU BORDER COUNTRIES INCREASE COOPERATION TO STOP RUSSIAN SANCTIONS EVASION

Six EU countries and Norway agreed this week to deepen their cooperation to combat Russian sanctions evasion and would produce joint guidelines for doing so.

Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and EFTA member state Norway met in Helsinki to coordinate a response and increase cooperation.

The European Union implemented a series of sanction packages on Russia after the country's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

The majority of the EU's trade, including sanctioned goods leaving the block, is transported via border states and Russia to third counties as their final destination.

This means these countries have a responsibility to enforce and check compliance with the rules - including whether they arrive at the correct destination countries.

"In view of the effectiveness of sanctions, Russia has invented many ways to circumvent them," a statement from the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.

The ministry said "continuous deep cooperation and unified efforts" are needed between countries to "further tackle evasion and circumvention".

It was agreed to deepen cooperation on sanctions implementation against Russia and Belarus, strengthen the uniform application of customs controls, work towards harmonizing the granting of authorizations and increase regular exchanges of information and best practices, the ministry said.

The countries will also produce joint guidance for economic operators to detect sanctions evasion and circumvention.

Representatives from Sweden, which helds the EU Presidency, and the European Commission, also attended the meeting. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas has called for a complete ban on the transit of European Union goods through Russia, Bloomberg reports.

"The easiest thing to do would be to ban transit in all countries bordering Russia," Kallas said.

She added that a solution was needed for the entire EU, not just Estonia.

"A separate Estonian sanction wouldn't solve the problem, because the exports would just move to another border country," the prime minister said.

Estonia's exports to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, Armenia and Uzbekistan had increased since last year, Kallas said, adding that she doubted whether many of the goods reached there after transiting through Russia.

Since last year, Estonian exports of semiconductors to Kazakhstan, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan have increased by 189%, 222% and 21,576%, respectively, the prime minister has said, calling on the EU to take action on the issue.

Estonia: Companies linked to Ossipenko providing services to state despite sanctions

TALLINN, May 26, BNS - Despite the fact that due to the sanctions on Russia, the Estonian state and local governments should terminate their contracts with utility service providers N&V and Ekovir operating in East-Viru County, they haven't done so -- previously owned by businessman Nikolai Ossipenko, these companies now belong to his wife, a citizen of Russia, the regional Pohjarannik writes.

Most municipalities of the northeastern county, and some from outside, are clients of N&V, a provider of landscaping, road and street maintenance and repair services, and waste management company Ekovir. In addition, N&V is responsible for the everyday maintenance of state roads in the county.

Last October, however, his wife Natalia Ossipenko, who is a citizen of Russia, became the sole shareholder of the companies instead of Nikolai Ossipenko. Nikolai Ossipenko himself was already in custody as a suspect in corruption crimes since fall of last year.

According to the EU sanction, a company owned 50 percent or more by a citizen of Russia may not be awarded public contracts, and the already concluded public procurement contracts with such entities must be terminated, the Finance Ministry said.

"Whether this citizen of the Russian Federation lives in Estonia, another member state of the European Union or a third country is not important in the context of this sanction," ministry spokespeople said.

In addition to municipalities, N&V provides service to the state by maintaining the roads here, but the Transport Administration had no idea that it was violating the sanctions imposed on Russia for more than half a year. Only after an inquiry did the authority begin to investigate the situation.

Erki Varma, spokesperson for the Transport Administration, told Pohjarannik that at the beginning of this year, when the company N&V OU was formed as a result of the merger of three companies, which continued to fulfill the contract for the maintenance of state roads in East-Viru County, a reason emerged to check the grounds for the removal of the company.

"Sanctions are checked on the basis of confirmations and, if there are doubts, further on the basis of evidence. N&V OU has confirmed in the answers to the inquiry that there are no grounds for removal and grounds related to international sanctions. Therefore, based on the provided confirmations, the procurer should not have had any doubts to perform an additional check at that moment. The Transport Administration was not aware that Natalia Ossipenko may be a citizen of the Russian Federation. N&V OU has been active in Estonia for a long time, and Natalia Ossipenko has been issued an Estonian personal identification code. The Transport Administration will check the information provided in this inquiry and submit an additional inquiry to N&V OU," the spokesperson said.

Varma added that if it is confirmed that the shareholder is a Russian citizen and no change is made to ownership, the basis for the sanction is met.

"According to this, the execution of a procurement contract that is valid after last Oct. 10 with more than 50 percent of the owners of the contractor being citizens, residents or companies of the Russian Federation, or such persons being the owners of the owners, cannot be continued," he said.

According to him, this serves as the basis for canceling the procurement contract.

Suspected Russian Intelligence Operative Extradited from Estonia to Face Charges Related to Providing American-Made Electronics and Ammunition to Russian Military

A Russian citizen with alleged ties to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) will be arraigned today on an indictment charging him with conspiracy and other charges related to a global procurement and money laundering network on behalf of the Russian government.

According to court documents, Vadim Konoshchenok, 48, of Tallinn, Estonia, was arrested in Estonia on a provisional arrest warrant issued from the Eastern District of New York and extradited from Estonia to the United States on July 13.

"This defendant, who is suspected of having ties to the FSB, smuggled hundreds of thousands of illicit munitions in support of Moscow's war machine, using front companies to conceal his criminal enterprise," said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department's National Security Division. "The Department of Justice remains steadfast in its mission to counter Russian aggression and we will give no quarter to those who violate U.S. sanctions to further fuel its war effort."

"In early December, I met with Estonian counterparts in Tallinn regarding the pending U.S. request to arrest Vadim Konoshchenok," said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. "I would like to pay tribute to Prosecutor General Andres Parmas's team, and to the Estonian Internal Security Service, for their prioritization of this case, and for their close coordination with the Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs on the provisional arrest and extradition of Konoshchenok."

"As alleged, the defendant was a critical participant in a scheme to provide sensitive, American-made electronics and ammunition in furtherance of Russia's war efforts and weapons development, violating U.S. export controls, economic sanctions and other criminal statutes," said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. "Let this case serve as the latest example that no matter where you are in the world, if you violate U.S. export controls or evade U.S. sanctions, we will not rest until you face justice in a U.S. courtroom."

"The FBI and our partners work diligently to bring to justice those who assist Russia's military interests and put national security at risk," said Assistant Director Suzanne Turner of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. "According to the allegations in the indictment, Konoshchenok helped the FSB smuggle military grade ammunition and a range of nuclear and computer equipment which could be used as instruments of war. Today's indictment is a fierce reminder of the lengths Russian intelligences services will go to advance Russia's military capabilities. The FBI is deeply committed to disrupting and dismantling these actions."

According to the indictment and court filings, Konoshchenok and his co-defendants were affiliated with Serniya Engineering and Sertal LLC (the Serniya Network), Moscow-based companies that operate under the direction of Russian intelligence services to procure advanced electronics and sophisticated testing equipment for Russia's military industrial complex and research and development sector, some of which can be used in the development of nuclear and hypersonic weapons, quantum computing and other military applications. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Department of Commerce (DOC) Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) levied sanctions against Serniya, Sertal and several individuals and companies engaged in the scheme, calling them "instrumental to the Russian Federation's war machine."

As alleged in the indictment, the Serniya Network was licensed to conduct highly sensitive and classified procurement activities by Russia's FSB, Russia's principal security agency and the main successor agency to the Soviet Union's KGB. According to court documents, in electronic communications, Konoshchenok explicitly identified himself as an FSB "Colonel" and enclosed a photograph of himself wearing his FSB uniform. Additionally, a review of electronic communications equipment recovered from Konoshchenok revealed saved contacts beginning with the prefix "FSB" and email addresses from "FSB[.]ru" domains. One of Konoshchenok's calendar entries referenced an "FSB order."

As described in the indictment, Estonia was a popular transshipment point, where Konoshchenok would smuggle U.S.-origin items across the border into Russia. On Oct. 27, 2022, Konoshchenok was detained by Estonian authorities while attempting to cross into Russia from Estonia with approximately 35 different types of semiconductors and electronic components, including several U.S.-origin and export-controlled items. Konoshchenok has also been repeatedly stopped by Estonian border officials attempting to smuggle hundreds of thousands of American-made and export-controlled rounds into Russia, including 6.5 mm, 7 mm, .338 and .308 magnum rounds, which are commonly used by snipers, as well as military-grade .223 rounds.

Konoshchenok used an Estonian front company called Stonebridge Resources and communicated frequently with other co-conspirators about sourcing, transporting and paying for controlled items. In electronic communications, Konoshchenok is clear that his fee is "10%" because he "can't do less. Sanctions . . . Sanction item for 10%."

To date, over half a ton of military-grade ammunition linked to Konoshchenok has been recovered or interdicted before being smuggled into Russia.

If convicted, Konoshchenok faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison.

The FBI is investigating the case. The Justice Department's Office of International Affairs and the Estonian authorities, including Estonian Internal Security Service (KAPO) and the Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic of Estonia, provided significant assistance in securing foreign evidence, the arrest and extradition of Konoshchenok.

Assistant U.S. Attorneys Artie McConnell and Matthew Skurnik for the Eastern District of New York and Trial Attorney Scott A. Claffee of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.

This case has been coordinated through the Justice Department's Task Force KleptoCapture, an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions, export restrictions, and economic countermeasures that the United States has imposed, along with its allies and partners, in response to Russia's unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. Announced by the Attorney General on March 2, 2022, and under the leadership of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the task force will leverage all the Department's tools and authorities against efforts to evade or undermine the economic actions taken by the U.S. government in response to Russian military aggression.

Vadim Konoshchenok will be arraigned this afternoon before United States Magistrate Judge Ramon E. Reyes, Jr., at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn on an indictment charging him with conspiracy and other charges related to a global procurement and money laundering network on behalf of the Russian government. Konoshchenok, a Russian citizen with alleged ties to Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), was arrested in Estonia on a provisional arrest warrant issued from the Eastern District of New York and extradited from Estonia to the United States on July 13, 2023.

Breon Peace, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York; Kenneth A. Polite, Jr., Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; Andrew C. Adams, Director, Task Force KleptoCapture; Christie M. Curtis, Acting Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office (FBI), and Jonathan Carson, Special Agent-in-Charge, U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Export Enforcement, New York Field Office (DOC), announced the extradition.

"As alleged, the defendant was a critical participant in a scheme to provide sensitive, American-made electronics and ammunition in furtherance of Russia’s war efforts and weapons development, violating U.S. export controls, economic sanctions and other criminal statutes," stated United States Attorney Peace. "Let this case serve as the latest example that no matter where you are in the world, if you violate U.S. export controls or evade U.S. sanctions, we will not rest until you face justice in a U.S. courtroom."

United States Attorney Peace thanked the Department of Justice’s Office of International Affairs and Estonian authorities, including Estonian Internal Security Service (KAPO) and the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Republic of Estonia for their significant assistance in securing foreign evidence, the arrest and extradition of Konoshchenok.

"In early December, I met with Estonian counterparts in Tallinn regarding the pending U.S. request to arrest Vadim Konoshchenok," stated Assistant Attorney General Polite.

"This defendant, who is suspected of having ties to the FSB, smuggled hundreds of thousands of illicit munitions in support of Moscow’s war machine, using front companies to conceal his criminal enterprise," said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department’s National Security Division. "The Department of Justice remains steadfast in its mission to counter Russian aggression and we will give no quarter to those who violate U.S. sanctions to further fuel its war effort."

"Vadim Konoshchenok allegedly provided cutting edge, American-developed technologies and ammunition to Russia for use in their illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Far from the battlefield, Konoshchenok will now face justice in an American courthouse, thanks to the staunch commitment of our Estonian partners and the federal prosecutors and agents who have dedicated their time and talents to disrupting the Kremlin’s war machine," stated KleptoCapture Director Adams.

"Last year, charges were announced against the defendant and others involved in this complex transnational criminal scheme under the direction of Russian intelligence services. Today’s extradition of Vadim Konoshchenok is a testament to the team of law enforcement professionals dedicated to enforcing U.S. export controls," stated DOC Special Agent-in-Charge Carson. "We will continue to enforce the unprecedented export controls implemented in response to Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine and the Office of Export Enforcement intends to pursue these violators wherever they may be worldwide."

According to the indictment and court filings, the defendants were affiliated with Serniya Engineering and Sertal LLC (the "Serniya Network"), Moscow-based companies that operate under the direction of Russian intelligence services to procure advanced electronics and sophisticated testing equipment for Russia’s military industrial complex and research and development sector, some of which can be used in the development of nuclear and hypersonic weapons, quantum computing and other military applications.

If convicted, the defendant faces a maximum of 30 years’ imprisonment. The charges in the indictment are allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

The government’s case is being handled by the Office’s National Security and Cybercrime Section. Assistant United States Attorneys Artie McConnell, Craig Heeren, and Matthew Skurnik are in charge of the prosecution, along with Trial Attorney Scott A.

A large number of steel and oil products and fertilisers arrive in Estonia via Russia. These are, at least according to the presented documentation, not of Russian origin, but have transited through Russia, and originated, for instance, in the Central Asian republics.

Ants Kutti, head of the external borders of the Tax and Customs Board (MTA), told ETV news show Aktuaalne kaamera (AK) that: "The imports from Russia and products of Russian origin are under sanction.

Sanctioned goods are still arriving across the Estonia-Russia border at Narva, but the items themselves originate from countries other than the Russian Federation.

A large number of steel and oil products and fertilizers arrive in Estonia via Russia. These are, at least according to the presented documentation, not of Russian origin, but have transited through Russia, and have originated, for instance, in the Central Asian republics.

In any case, Russian-origin products are generally sanctioned.

Ants Kutti, head of the external borders of the Tax and Customs Board (MTA), said: "The imports from Russia and products of Russian origin are under sanction. Currently, the products, which have been arriving have mostly come from Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Georgia. Customs checks and requests additional documentation, including bank transfers and contracts, so we have had no reason to doubt their origin or fear they actually have come, fraudulently, straight from Russia,"

This means that products such as fertilizers and petroleum-based items are being imported legally.

Over 100 trucks pass through the Narva customs checkpoint in each direction daily and, while this is about half the pre-war figure, the smaller numbers at least provide more time to thoroughly check what these trucks are carrying.

At the same time, the growing list of sanctioned items has led to a workload around 50% higher than it had been, for MTA officials.

Greater sanctions could also lead to greater scope for smuggling, though Kutti said that euro banknotes - with the average amount seized from private individuals being in the region of EUR 5,000-EUR 6,000 - were a common item, as were motoring items such as oil and spare parts.

"It seems that there is a very serious shortage over there in Russia of these things," Kutti said.

Since the end of June, passenger cars have been barred for export to Russia for sale, and more and more cars with fake papers are being apprehended at Narva checkpoint. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

The war in Ukraine and the G7's declaration are among the main stories covered by Estonian newspapers and news websites on 21-22 August 2023.

Foreign minister: G7 declaration gives Ukraine 'security collateral'

Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna writes in an opinion piece for Estonian Public Broadcasting portal that the G7 declaration, which has been joined by 18 states, including Estonia, gives Ukraine "security collateral" and should eventually lead to Ukraine becoming member of Nato. He writes that the deal ensures that governments will keep supporting Ukraine even when leaders change. Tsahkna writes that the declaration "refutes talk about war weariness" and notes that Estonia is the "strongest supporter of Ukraine per capita". Noting that Ukraine "received a promise 15 years ago that it would become member of the alliance", he says there must now be "vigorous steps to turn past promises into reality". (ERR, 21 August)

Columnist criticises West's delay, weariness

Columnist Edward Lucas writes in his column for daily paper Eesti Paevaleht that, while the news that Ukrainian pilots will receive training and planes is good, the "delay is maddening". He notes that the familiar pattern of "while western leaders were doubting, Ukrainians were dying" is being repeated. Noting that losses on both sides amount to half a million, Lucas says that while Putin bears responsibility for each of them, that responsibility is shared with the Western leaders who "failed to stop him". Lucas notes that the West's "weariness is noticeable" and lays out a "dark scenario" under which Ukraine receives Nato membership in return for abandoning some occupied territory, warning that this will only "increase Putin's appetite". He notes that the only way to avoid this is by "striving for victory as much as the Ukrainians". (Eesti Paevaleht, 22 August)

Editorial calls out Estonian businesses supporting Russia with chips

Estonian daily newspaper Eesti Paevaleht writes in its editorial that while Russia lacks the microchips required for its weapons, the country is receiving them from sanction busters. The paper reports that according to research Russia managed to import chips "worth hundreds of millions of dollars last year". The paper reports that two Estonian companies Elmec trade and Idatrading are taking part in this trade on the principle "nothing personal, just war". The paper writes that it is "shameful" that there are such "cynics among businessmen" even as Estonia is the "biggest supporter of Ukraine per capita". (Eesti Paevaleht, 21 August)

ESTONIA: OVER 300 COMPANIES STILL EXPORT TO RUSSIA

Estonian exports to Russia have declined dramatically since 2019, although there are still companies in Estonia doing business with Russia.

According to the Estonian Tax and Customs Board (MTA), about 1,000 Estonian companies shipped items to Russia in 2019. Exports to Russia declined dramatically after 2022, when Russia began a war in Ukraine and the European Union imposed sanctions on many categories of goods.

The number of Estonian companies exporting goods that are not currently subject to sanctions has also decreased almost 3-fold, Valeri Rauam, head of the customs department at the MTA, has said.

"Comparing the volumes of the first half of this year with the volumes of the first half of 2019, the number of companies exporting goods to Russia has dropped to about 300 and the number of customs declarations filed has also dropped by nearly 50%," Rauam said.

These 300 entities are listed in the Estonian commercial register, and their customs declarations indicate that they are the shippers. The number of Latvian firms exporting to Russia has decreased by the same magnitude over the period.

Of the permitted categories of goods, Estonian companies mainly export foodstuffs, textiles and various equipment and vehicles.

"One of the main categories of products for which the transitional period will end in September is vehicles, after which passenger cars of a certain capacity will no longer be allowed to be exported to Russia. Until now, there was a ban on luxury items, i.e., if a car cost EUR 50,000 or more; however, exports to Russia will be banned on September 25 regardless of the price of the vehicle," he said.

Companies from other countries also export to Russia via Estonia; for example, companies from other nations export mushrooms to Russia. But their export volumes have also decreased considerably compared to a few years ago, Rauam said.

"These volumes have fallen volumes by each product group are relatively small," he said.

There is no list of Estonian companies that have exported products to Russia that are subject to Russian sanctions. Andres Siplane, chief specialist of the Foreign Ministry's sanctions and strategic goods department, said that this information was accessible to the public through court rulings.

"The agenda of court hearings is published in the official gazette (Riigi Teataja), where you can learn which companies and individuals are presently being tried, as well as their cases. The details of those companies - they are very few in number - are immediately available. It's a two-minute job to find that out and so it doesn't make sense for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to keep a separate list of them," Siplane explained.

Siplane added that not all the infringers identified in court decisions might be Estonian companies. Non-public lists of sanction violators are also available to the various authorities handling the cases, Siplane says.

"However, until the company is found guilty by a court, these lists will not be made public," he added. "And it has also happened, as the press has reported, that an Estonian company operates in another country has violated sanctions." (ERR/Business World Magazine)

Estonian exports to Russia have decreased significantly since 2019, although there are still 300 companies in Estonia doing business with Russia, ERR.ee. the website of Estonian national broadcaster ERR, reported on August 22.

The following is the text of an unattributed article, entitled "Bloody chips are feeding the Russian war machine" and published by the Estonian newspaper Eesti Paevaleht on 21 August:

Those who follow the war news are probably not surprised by reports that Russian weapons striking Ukraine sometimes contain microchips intended for laundry machines, for instance.

This shows two things: Russia has a shortage of chips (they themselves are unable to produce them) and they are needed in Russian weapons. Hence, Ukrainians could resist better if Russians could not get chips for their weapons.

Laundry machines are only marginal "culprits" next to this stream of chips, which reaches Russia with the help of sanction evaders. One can read from today’s newspaper that, according to the USA, Russia managed to import these valuable items worth hundreds of millions of dollars last year. One can only speculate how many lives of Ukrainian children have been sacrificed in the name of business conducted with the aggressor.

Even in Estonia there are companies following the principle "nothing personal, only war" – why should some massacre prevent profit-making. In particular, this refers to two companies: Elmec Trade (which was sanctioned by the USA) and Idatrading.

Regrettably, some of this business is technically legal, especially if third states are being used to launder the goods. This is similar to the legality of some other industry through which Russian warmongers are funded. For example, the importing of liquified gas (LPG), about which [business newspaper] Delfi Arileht wrote last week.

The Estonian state has been one of the biggest contributors to Ukraine’s resistance. This makes it even more embarrassing that our entrepreneurs include cynics who can also be called enemy’s collaborators in our common fight for Ukraine’s freedom.

ESTONIA: METAPRINT SUPPLIES ESSENTIAL RAW MATERIALS TO RUSSIA

Urmas Reinsalu, chair of Isamaa and former foreign minister, said Metaprint, a client of Stark Logistics, owned by Prime Minister Kaja Kallas' spouse (Reform), supplied raw materials to Russia for the production of goods under EU sanctions.

"There has been talk of closing a factory in Russia. However, the factory's revenue increased to 1.8 billion rubles in 2022," Reinsalu said. "If raw materials are being shipped to the factory, last year was not the year it closed."

Reinsalu went on to say that there were separate legal and moral issues of supplying raw materials to the Russian factory.

"This raw material is used to make aerosol cans, which have been under EU sanctions since spring to weaken Russian industry," he said. "Thus, raw materials were exported to Russia, which were later used to manufacture products under EU sanctions."

Reinsalu pointed out that the European Union had already imposed sanctions on certain non-alloyed metals beginning in July 2022, and that a number of other metal items would be added in March.

"To say that transporting goods to a factory in Russia is not transporting goods in Russia is utterly deceptive," Reinsalu said. "The prime minister has not provided substantive answers to questions of major importance."

"I recall making a written proposal to the Reform Party in June last year, during coalition negotiations, to close the land border with Russia, along with Poland and the other Baltic States, as a national sanction. Then, for whatever reason, it was ignored, and the coalition agreement simply included an agenda for an EU-wide policy. It is a moral and legal question whether the prime minister, as a person financially connected to such a business (via loans and family ties), should have recused herself from decision-making."

Metaprint did not reply to questions from numerous media outlets on August 24.

Arvo Hallik, the husband of Kaja Kallas and a member of the Supervisory Board who owns a quarter of Stark Logistics' shares, is also promising to respond in writing.

Kallas, the prime minister and Reform Party chair, said she learned about the activities of her husband and his business partner in Russia on August 21. Stark Logistics' Russia operations will be shut down in September owing to his ethical assessment, Kallas has said.

"I have always tried to keep my professional and personal lives separate, but now they have merged. At issue is my husband's business partner. I have no exposure to or thorough knowledge of his business activity," Kallas told a government press conference. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

Estonian customs have detected almost 5,000 breaches of sanctions

TALLINN, Aug 29, BNS – Since the sanctions on Russia took effect, the Estonian Tax and Customs Board has carried out nearly 70,000 inspections and detected almost 5,000 breaches of various degrees of severity, a senior customs official told a joint sitting of the Riigikogu state budget control and anti-corruption select committees on Tuesday.

"Checks by the Estonian Tax and Customs Board have grown and changed enormously since the first days of the war. While in the past we mainly focused on import control, during the war we have strongly reoriented our activities and are now predominantly controlling the export of goods to Russia and other countries," Kulli Kurvits, head of customs formalities at the Tax and Customs Board's customs department, told MPs.

She noted that the agency is carrying out checks on multiple levels.

"We check documents, goods, carry out checks both within the country and at borders. Control also includes the exchange of risk related information between different EU member states," Kurvits said. She emphasized that customs is an implementing, not a lawmaking authority. There is no full embargo on trade with Russia, which means that trade still takes place.

When asked about the operations of the company Stark Logistics, the official replied that although the Tax and Customs Board does not have the right to comment on specific transactions by specific companies, they can confirm that Stark Logistics has been acting in compliance with the sanctions.

Kurvits said that for the customs, too narrow goods codes cause problems.

"The more detailed the bans, the harder it is for everyone to comply. For example, there are also interesting sanctions where one component is subject to sanction and another is not," she said.

Kurvits added that the Tax and Customs Board will submit its proposals to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which can go with them to the European level so that such gaps can be plugged. According to the agency, more general sanctions should be prepared, which would make the work of both customs and businesses easier. For the customs, the main category of goods where a shift is necessary from components to a more general ban is machinery, equipment and other electronics.

Estonian journalist: Sanctions hurting Russian economy

The following is the text of an analysis piece by journalist Mikk Salu entitled "Anti-Russian sanctions have holes but they will not save Putin for long" and published by the leading daily newspaper Postimees on 1 September; subheadings are newspaper’s own:

Both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are predicting economic growth for Russia this year, in fact the growth forecast has been even corrected a bit upwards.

In this light and considering that Russia’s enthusiasm to wage a war in Ukraine has not waned, one could ask whether anti-Russian sanctions are working at all.

To a large extent, this debate is between a half full or half empty glass. If the benchmark is the tone of optimistic statements at the start of the war on how sanctions will break Russia’s economy, then this is not how things have gone. If the benchmark is whether sanctions are hurting the Russian economy and making it in the near term harder for Russia to fight in Ukraine, and whether they reduce the long-term competitiveness of the Russian economy, then the answer is "yes".

The story about economic growth is in fact rather simple. The state is pumping increasing amounts of money to the military industry, and this is also stimulating the GDP of the Russian economy. For this year, the Russian state budget foresees nine trillion roubles for the areas of "national defence" and "national security". Like Aleksandra Prokopenko, who until early 2022 worked for the Central Bank of Russia, in fact the spending has been even faster: by the end of May, already 60% of the "national defence" budget had been spent. If one adds to this significantly higher social subsidies by the state, then this is where Russia’s economic growth is coming from.

According to economic theory, this is ordinary Keynesian economics – the state is stimulating the economy thanks to state spending that grows the economy. This works, but not infinitely.

A simple economy

Russia’s economy is fundamentally simple. This is a state that exports raw materials. Before the war, Russia exported fossil fuels (oil, gas, coal, etc.) for approximately one billion euros a day. But in the initial months of the war, this grew significantly above one billion – this is probably something that those who imposed sanctions could not foresee, while for Russia this meant exceptionally higher revenues. But CREA (Center for Research of Energy and Clean Air), which compiles statistics on Russia’s raw materials, shows that since last autumn, revenues have constantly declined and in recent months have remained between 600-700 million euros a day. Compare to the pre-war time, this means losing approximately 70-90 billion euros from exports in one year.

But the biggest blow has come from natural gas. Recently it was reported that exports of Russia’s liquified natural gas (LNG) to Europe have doubled, which led some to immediately say that sanctions are not working. But LNG is just a fraction of Russia’s gas business. The main thing is still pipelines and this business has dried up. Nor are new pipelines (to China or India) emerging from anywhere. Gazprom’s profits, according to the company itself, have dropped eightfold compared to a year ago, and the company’s share price has fallen 50% compared to the prewar period.

It has been simpler with oil in Russia. Oil is transported on ships and ships can go anywhere in the world. Statistics shows that at least in terms of volume, Russia’s oil exports area as great as before the war. Instead of Europe, it is selling to China, and in particular India’s share has grown. If one counts earned money instead of volume, then Russia has probably had to give in. Whereas in the past, tankers leaving ports near St Petersburg were shipping oil to Europe, then now they must ship it to another part of the world – this is more expensive.

Late last year, the West imposed a price ceiling for Russian oil – 60 dollars per barrel – and Estonia played a key role in these negotiations. It is difficult to evaluate how effectively the price ceiling worked. The International Energy Agency has estimated that at the beginning of this year, Russia had to sell oil at a large discount, but not in April-May. Indirect data shows that they managed to sell to China even for 70 dollars for a barrel, however to India they had to sell cheaply, below 50 dollars for a barrel. These are indirect calculations because Russia does not publish any data, and if some Russian and Chinese merchants make deals with each other, this happens behind closed doors. But China’s and India’s own statistics is still accessible and based on this something can be concluded.

Convenience and its price

The third blow to the Russian economy is the reduction in the imports of Western technology. From a temporary macroeconomic perspective this may not be so bad for Russia because they may not have to spend so many dollars and euros on importing Western equipment, meaning they can direct more money for waging the war. In practical terms, they must give up some conveniences. Instead of new Western cars they must buy used or Chinese cars. They do not have as high quality, but this is just a matter of convenience.

It will be more difficult with the kind of equipment, whose absence or reduction a regular consumer may not even feel (for Putin it is important that an average Russian continues living "normally"), but which are still very important: machinery, industrial equipment, microchips, industrial electronics, semiconductors, and all else.

In the long term, the wealth of states has a simple foundation. It is the increase in productivity, which is largely derived from new, better and more innovative technologies. Russia has developed the market economy for 30 years, but technologically they remain impotent. Hence, sanctions are not working fully, but increasing technological backwardness. For example, Russia has only two chip producers, MTSC and Baikal, their processors are not as modern and fast as Western versions, but more or less perform their jobs. But even they rely on Western equipment, and if it is not coming, then just like it was reported in the news a few days ago, Baikal has gone bankrupt.

Cracks in the Russian economy were actually visible long before the war. During the first half of Putin’s rule, the Russian economy grew fast, probably a major part of his authority and popularity derives from it, but during the past ten years there has been stagnation.

The World Bank shows that in the period 2011-2021, the Russian economy grew at an average of 1.7 per cent. In comparison: the Estonian economy grew at 3.7 per cent a year on average during this period. This is a very big difference and in fact it should be the other way round. Estonia is much richer than Russia, which means that Russia should grow faster if it wants to catch up. Russian analysts also admit that the "normal" growth of the Russian economy should be four to five per cent a year, if the goal is to move towards the Western quality of life. But the reality is opposite: Russian economy stagnated already before the war and the gap with the West was growing.

Some things do not work

Even if the war and sanctions do not land a hard blow in this context, they still erode the Russian economy. Statistics shows that exports from the European Union to Central Asian and Caucasian states have significantly increased during the war. These are probably goods headed to Russia, which are shipped there through third states. This is certainly an area where sanctions have at least partly failed. In this context, the USA recently threatened to sanction Kyrgyzstan unless it takes some steps. Diplomats of the European Union also work on this, but so far there are no visible results.

Hundreds of Russian companies have fled Russia. Whereas initially the Kremlin was rather mild by its own standards, by forcing Western companies to sell their assets at deep discounts, then in recent months a harsher path has been chosen. Hence, Finland’s Fortum’s and Germany’s Uniper’s subsidiaries were transferred to state administration, which formally is not nationalisation, but effectively rather close to it. Some time later, Carlsberg and Danone, which are respectively Russia’s second biggest beer brewer and second dairy producer, met same fate. Ramzan Kadyrov’s nephew Yakub Zakriev was appointed director of Danone.

Given that Uniper and Fortum operate in the energy sector, one could say that this relates to some kind of strategic interests of the Russian state, but the de facto nationalisation of beer and dairy producers is a step forward.

Right now there is a debate in Russia on what to do with Western companies’ assets. This time the debate means that each clan is trying to do its thing. One group is talking about direct nationalisation. But another group, led by Rosneft’s influential leader, the oligarch-politician Igor Sechin, is promoting "privatisation". But privatisation probably means that loyal fellow businessmen will be able to "privatise" Western companies or assets left behind by them. An example of such privatisation is how Kadyrov’s nephew overnight became Russia’s second-biggest dairy businessman.

In the short term, taking control of Western companies’ assets may suit both the Kremlin and oligarchs, but in the long-term replacing more effective and productive Western investments with local circular connections will do no good for Russia’s economic growth.

The impact of anti-Russian sanctions is weaker than initially thought, but they still work and are hurting the Kremlin. The Russian economy will not collapse because the state is pumping money to it. But export revenues have fallen. Russian rouble has weakened with respect to the dollar for several months. The Central Bank of Russia was recently forced to raise interest rates. Unemployment is low because many potential employees are currently at the front and in military factories. The technological lag is increasing.

Should full embargo be imposed on Russia?

[Estonian] Interior minister, chair of the Social Democratic Party Lauri Laanemets told Postimees that imposing full embargo would require a broader debate and the question is why Estonia should do it alone. In his view, this could be requested in the European Union, as it has been attempted so far. Laanemets gave an example that Estonia has actively voiced in the European Union the issue of transporting harvesters to Russia via Estonia.

According to Laanemets, imposing an embargo in Estonia would only mean that the final objective is not attained and this will not force the Russian state to end the war in Ukraine. "This is a question for a broader debate whether we fully close the border. We must understand that our border is part of the European Union’s eastern border. These goods will be shipped here to Estonia and to Europe via Finland and Latvia," he said.

Finance Minister Mart Vorklaev (Reform Party) admitted that the Reform Party has repeatedly said that all trade should be terminated with Russia. "We have adopted such a moral position and also publicly stated it," he added. "Also other politicians have confirmed this to my knowledge, but it can implemented by those who either conduct or do not conduct this business."

ESTONIA: FIRMS' DESIRE TO PULL OUT OF RUSSIAN MARKET COMPLICATED BY MANY FACTORS

A reluctance on the part of some Estonian firms to pull out of Russian markets altogether should not solely be put down to greed or short-sightedness.

Fines and court actions, possibly even in European courts, by Russian partners over canceled orders, the difficulty of finding new markets at a time of general downturn and obstacles to disengagement put in place by the Russian Federation itself are all significant factors.

The issue particularly is faced by companies, for instance involved in logistics, who had long before the current invasion had a significant proportion of their business tied up in or with Russia; some firms say that in fact stricter sanctions would help, provided these are applied uniformly both across business sectors and across EU member states.

Many of the issues facing Estonian firms would likely translate to those in other EU and Western countries as well.

What proportion of companies are, as it were, trapped in Russia, and how many remain simply for profitability reasons is nigh impossible to delineate; some Western firms are actively seeking to exploit loopholes in sanctions, Kulli Kurvits, head of the customs formalities department at the Tax and Customs Board (MTA), has said.

Kurvits provided as an example luxury car exporters attempting to satisfy the not inconsiderable thirst for shiny vehicles in Russia.

Sanctions ban bringing in vehicles worth over EUR 50,000 into Russia, but this, Kurvits says, has been followed by smaller operators bringing in cars worth EUR 49,000, two or three at a time.

However, and Kurvits pointed to this as an example of success for the agency, a new sanctions package adopted a few months ago would come into effect from the end of this month - and this would ban the export of all passenger cars into Russia, luxury or otherwise.

Of more quotidian items, Kurvits referred to electrical plugs - subject to sanction unless they had a cable attached in which case they were allowed, as things stood.

"Bearing in mind Russia has been experiencing shortages across quite a few product groups, loopholes like this will be probed for in respect of Europe, or of the rest of the world," she said.

In a sense the devil is in the detail with sanctions, and this provides plenty of options for circumvention, Kurvits says.

The MTA itself recommends barring all types of electronics, white goods, machinery and other equipment for transport into Russia.

The Russian authorities themselves have made pulling out of the country more complicated, for another thing. A committee formed last autumn must approve the sale of any stake, before it can go ahead, for instance.

Marie Allikmaa, head of the business and consumer environment department at the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, said: "We have heard of long waiting lines for applications to the committee numbering several thousand at present. At the same time, the committee works somewhat haphazardly and arbitrarily. Some applications get resolved within a month, but Estonians are not exactly in the good books there."

Those who do get the go ahead to sell often have to settle for half the fair price, Allikmaa adds.

"Companies that are exiting, or have already exited, the Russian market today say that it has proven very unprofitable, and they will definitely not be able to obtain their market's worth there. This will certainly lead to losses," she went on.

Some business-people say that a greater uniformity in sanctions would help.

Allikmaa confirmed that sanctions helped protect entrepreneurs from claims, as written into the International Sanctions Act. "However, this is not just a matter of sanctioned goods. It is true that for Russian entrepreneurs - should an Estonian entrepreneur opt to terminate a contract immediately - then of course there will be a high risk and probability that the liquidated damages will be due in Russia."

In this case, it is not out of the question that, since damages can be sought in a court in the country of origin, an Estonian court may have to grant this right to claim damages to a Russian company.

Compensation for companies pulling out of Russia, for instance on ethical grounds following the February 2022 invasion, has not been discussed at ministry level, Marie Allikmaa says, pointing out that since the insurgency war in Eastern Ukraine began back in 2014, the knowledge of the risks of doing business in Russia is hardly a new thing.

Nonetheless, the state can offer help and advice to those businesses who want to find new markets or reshape production to their needs, including an international expert engagement service which makes available experts on other markets, and special loan guarantees to those firms whose turnover to a significant proportion derives from Russia, or for that matter, from Ukraine.

The reasons for entrepreneurs not forgoing all their business ties in and with Russia are complex, in Estonia, Allikmaa adds.

One factor can be if the Estonian business concerns just one branch of a foreign-owned group or listed company, which makes loss-making decisions difficult to make independently, in Estonia.

Hekotek, a company, which produces equipment for the timber industry, received orders worth a hundred million euros from Russian customers on the eve of the full-scale invasion. Contracts had been signed and advance in some cases already paid.

These funds, Hekotek CEO Heiki Einpaul said, were then used to produce the ordered equipment, which must be delivered - otherwise bankruptcy would follow if the Russian customers demanded a refund.

No new contracts were being concluded with Russian customers, Einpaul added - though the backlog of existing contracts was taking time to process, since Russian customers themselves had gotten into difficulties with paying for the goods ordered, in many cases.

In short, walking away from agreements and awaiting arbitration stock in three-to-five years is not realistic, he adds.

Moreover, placing the company in jeopardy can itself end up with legal difficulty at home, Einpaul says, if, for instance, a company board member is charged with not carrying out his or her duty of care, for example.

Only those companies that did not have a significant proportion of business in Russia could afford to pull out quickly, he said - while the Estonian state and the EU could also provide help in doing this, not least by putting in place a full boycott and range of sanctions, backed by the force of law.

Meanwhile Ermo Perolainen, head of the Rahvusvahelise Autovedajate Assotsiatsioon, a lobby group for the haulage sector, said that for many firms, the Russia-facing market was all that they knew, while re-focusing on, for instance, a more westerly direction would run into competition brought about by the glut of carriers now available in Europe as a result of contracting business there.

Regulations and expectations should be equal for all businesses and types of business in this region, Perolainen added; were stricter sanctions imposed in concert with all the other EU countries bordering Russia and Belarus, including the other two Baltic States, then hauliers in Estonia would have no objections to the policy, he added.

This should be twinned with EU-level support measures for EU-based companies, he went on. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

Estonia bans entry of Russian motor vehicles

TALLINN, Sep 13, BNS - Starting at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, Estonia prohibits motor vehicles with Russian Federation license plates from entering Estonia across the external border, as such motor vehicles fall under the scope of the sanction.

In doing so, Estonia follows the additional interpretation of the sanctions against the Russian Federation published by the European Commission on Sept. 8, according to which motor vehicles registered in the Russian Federation are no longer allowed to enter the territory of the European Union.

"The sanctions against Russia have one aim -- to force the aggressor state to retreat to its borders. As the European Commission has just further clarified the existing sanctions and Estonia considers it necessary to use all means to raise the cost of the aggression for Russia, we have found, in consultation with the authorities of Latvia and Lithuania, that by jointly imposing sanctions we make the restrictions most efficient," Estonia's Minister of the Interior Lauri Laanemets said.

The ban on entering Estonia with a motor vehicle applies regardless of the basis of its owner's or user's stay in Estonia or the EU.

Motor vehicles bearing Russian number plates are allowed to leave Estonia by crossing the external border or across the internal borders of the European Union.

Upon arrival at a border crossing point of a vehicle bearing a license plate of the Russian Federation, the Tax and Customs Board will carry out the appropriate procedures. The user or owner of the motor vehicle must return to Russia with the vehicle or cross the border without it.

TALLINN, Sep 13, BNS - Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna on Wednesday described the decision to ban cars with Russian number plates from entering Estonia as the only right move.

"I am glad that the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Finance quickly implemented it. As I said yesterday, the European Commission's renewed guidance on cars with Russian number plates is fully in line with Estonia's foreign policy interests, positions and the sanctions policy," Tsahkna said.

The minister said that already on Thursday, he will raise the question in the government of what to do with the vehicles with Russian license plates that are already here.

The minister is about to meet via video conference with representatives of other member states on the EU's external border to discuss the issue.

Tsahkna said that for Estonia as a country bordering Russia it is important to implement such restrictions together with its neighbors.

"I welcome the fact that Latvia and Lithuania have already taken a similar decision. If implemented jointly, the restrictions will be more effective, and this will provide an opportunity to raise the cost of the aggression for Russia even higher," he said.

The minister added that we cannot help citizens of the aggressor state to enjoy the benefits offered by freedom and democracy while Russia continues its genocide in Ukraine.

Starting at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, Estonia prohibits motor vehicles with Russian Federation license plates from entering Estonia across the external border, as such motor vehicles fall under the scope of the sanction.

In doing so, Estonia follows the additional interpretation of the sanctions against the Russian Federation published by the European Commission on Sept. 8, according to which motor vehicles registered in the Russian Federation are no longer allowed to enter the territory of the European Union.

Estonia is banning the entry of cars with Russian number plates as of 10:00 on Wednesday, 13 September.

"Starting today, in 16 minutes to be precise, Estonia will deny entry to all Russian registered vehicles. They are not welcome here to enjoy privileges freedom has to offer until Ukraine has achieved victory," the Estonian foreign minister said.

Thus, Estonia will comply with the recommendations of the European Commission, according to which EU countries are not allowed to allow private cars with Russian registration plates to enter the EU.

"Sanctions against Russia have one goal – to force the aggressor state to retreat to its state borders.

Insofar as the European Commission newly further clarified the current sanction and Estonia considers it necessary to utilise all opportunities to raise the price of aggression for Russia, we found in consultation with Latvian and Lithuanian authorities that restrictions are most effective when jointly enforcing sanctions," Interior Minister Läänemets said, quoted by ERR[https://news.err.ee/1609098554/estonia-s-russian-car-entry-ban-in-effect-from-10-am-wednesday].

The Tax and Customs Department will conduct appropriate procedures if a vehicle with Russian registration plates arrives at a border checkpoint. The user or owner of the vehicle will have to return to Russia with the car or cross the border without it.

Background:

* On 8 September, the European Commission published an explanation regarding long-established restrictions on importing and exporting goods to or from Russia. They specified that cars and some goods are also banned, regardless of whether they are the personal belongings of travellers.

* Lithuania warned that it will stop letting in cars with Russian registration plates except for those travelling in transit to Kaliningrad Oblast after an explanation from the European Commission.

* Following Lithuania, Latvia announced the same decision.

As of 10 a.m. on September 13, Estonia has banned motor vehicles with Russian license plates from entering the country, as they are subject to EU sanctions.

With this step, Estonia has adhered to new guidelines issued by the European Commission on September 8 regarding the enforcement of existing sanctions, according to which EU member states might not allow cars with Russian license plates into the EU.

This ban applies not just to private vehicles, but also to company transport operations. Enforcement of these sanctions is mandatory for member states.

"Sanctions against Russia have one goal - to force the aggressor state to retreat to its state borders," Minister of the Interior Lauri Laanemets (SDE) said on September 13, commenting on the move.

"Insofar as the European Commission newly further clarified the current sanction and Estonia considered it necessary to utilize all opportunities to raise the price of aggression for Russia, we found in consultation with Latvian and Lithuanian authorities that restrictions were most effective when jointly enforcing sanctions," Laanemets continued.

In accordance with the Commission guidelines, the motor vehicle entry ban applies regardless of the owner or driver's grounds for their stay in Estonia or the EU. It nonetheless doesn't extend to vehicles owned by either EU citizens or their immediate family members.

Vehicles with Russian plates will be permitted to leave Estonia and/or cross the EU's internal borders.

Upon the arrival of a vehicle with Russian plates at an Estonian border checkpoint, the Estonian Tax and Customs Board (MTA) will perform the relevant procedures. The driver or owner of a vehicle subject to the entry ban will thereafter either have to return to Russia together with the vehicle or cross the border without it. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

Estonian association: Entry ban for Russia-registered vehicles doesn't apply to haulage

TALLINN, Sep 14, BNS – The Association of Estonian International Road Carriers pointed out on Thursday that the ban on the entry of Russia-registered motor vehicles imposed by Estonia does not affect freight transport, as the movement of cargo vehicles with Russian or Belarusian number plates on European Union roads is forbidden since April 2022.

Ermo Perolainen, board member and secretary general of the association, told BNS that the Estonian decision has no impact on road haulage. Non-sanctioned goods authorized for transport to Russia can be transported from the territory of the EU to Russia by hauliers from all countries except Russia and Belarus.

Perolainen explained that if the haulier is a company from an EU member state, then after entry into Russia, in most cases the goods are reloaded in the border zone and handed over to a Russian haulier who delivers them to the destination. This is Russia's retaliatory sanction, he said. However, there are certain exceptions for goods that are allowed to be transported by EU carriers to the final destination without reloading onto a vehicle of a Russian carrier.

If the haulier is a company from a third country to which Russia has not applied sanctions, such as Serbia, Turkey or Kazakhstan, they can transport all goods not sanctioned by the European Union to the final destination without having to reload them en route.

Starting at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, Estonia prohibited motor vehicles with Russian Federation license plates from entering Estonia across the external border, as such motor vehicles fall under the scope of the sanction. In doing so, Estonia follows the additional interpretation of the sanctions published by the European Commission on Sept. 8, according to which motor vehicles registered in the Russian Federation are no longer allowed to enter the territory of the EU.

Estonian interior minister: No full clarity re confiscation of Russian vehicles

TALLINN, Sep 14, BNS - There is still no full clarity in Europe regarding the practice of confiscating vehicles with Russian license plates, Estonian Minister of the Interior Lauri Laanemets said at the government's press conference on Thursday.

According to Laanemets, the European Commission's interpretation of this sanction is that vehicles with Russian license plates that are already in the EU should be confiscated and not allowed to leave the EU.

"It has yet to be implemented in this way in any European country -- only Germany has done it to some extent -- and yesterday's meeting of foreign ministers resulted in the fact that no one knows exactly how to implement this in detail," Laanemets, adding that Estonian authorities will have to start dealing with the matter.

The interior minister added that in addition to the Police and Border Guard, which will largely have to implement this rule, expertise will also lie with the Tax and Customs Board, which knows which goods are sanctioned and what to do with them.

On Wednesday, starting at 10 a.m., Estonia blocked access to the country for vehicles with Russian license plates. According to Laanemets, no vehicles with Russian license plates appeared at the border until Wednesday evening, so there was no need to block entry to the country for any car for that reason.

"Even the Russian side is clarifying that such cars will not be allowed into Estonia and will not be permitted to transit through the country, either," Laanemets said, adding that on a regular day, approximately 40 vehicles with Russian license plates used to move from Russia to Estonia in a 24-hour period.

Estonia: Lux Express says Russia-registered buses not subject to sanction

TALLINN, Sep 14, BNS – Estonian bus company Lux Express said on Thursday that it uses buses of its subsidiary AO Eurolines, which are registered in Russia, for services between Estonia and Russia, and pointed out in this context that public transport operated with vehicles with more than nine seats is not subject to EU sanctions.

Ingmar Roos, chief of operations of Lux Express in Estonia, told BNS bus services between Estonia and Russia are operated on the basis of regular service authorizations issued pursuant to an agreement between the Estonian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications and the Russian Ministry of Transport.

"They foresee the services being operated by transport companies from both countries. Lux Express uses a subsidiary company, AO Eurolines, whose buses are registered in Russia and are the ones occasionally seen on the Estonian side, to fulfil this mutual transport obligation. AO Eurolines has a total of 11 buses, of which six are in service," Roos said.

The executive pointed out that the ban on entering Estonia across the external border of the European Union for vehicles with Russian license plates, which stepped into force in Estonia on Wednesday, does not apply to public transport vehicles with more than nine seats.

"Thus, the European Commission's package of sanctions does not restrict the movement of public transport across the borders between Russia and the European Union. This means that the EU's sanctions package has made an exception for public transport -- the option is retained for people who have a pressing need to move across the border of Russia," he said.

Estonian daily hails EU's new sanctions against Russia

The following is the text of an unattributed article, entitled "The way to beat up Russia should be the same for everybody" and published by popular privately-owned Estonian newspaper Postimees on 14 September:

Opinions differ about the numerous sanctions imposed against Russia. There are those who believe that sanctions are not working. Russia’s economy has not completely failed and Western sanctions are rather benefitting China or India, which are simply taking over favourable deals.

But there are also those who represent common sense and who do not understand the piecemeal tactic because such sanctions on Russia that the West has imposed by now, should have been in place already when Putin’s regime was planning a major invasion of Ukraine.

Realpolitik is swinging somewhere between these two views, sometimes increasing sanctions – in a piecemeal fashion – accompanied by statements that the price of aggression must be high. Indeed, it must be!

It cannot be said that sanctions are not working but one could do better. According to Postimees, [sanctions] should be boosted and the additional interpretation of the European Commission on the sanctions imposed on motor vehicles with Russian license plates is welcome.

On the one hand this may appear like bullying regular persons as long as Russian citizens have the right to enter the European Union. Now they will have to leave their vehicles at the border. But the intention of this inconvenience is to make the citizens of the aggressor state understand what their state is doing. Compared to Ukrainian war victims, the sufferings of Russian car owners are trivial.

But in order for sanctions to work, it is also necessary that states implementing them operate uniformly. Right now this applies to four EU states that share an immediate border with Russia: Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. If, for example, Lithuanians rushed to implement the sanction, then Finns are rather taking their time to ponder. Still, states should coordinate both the implementation of the sanction as well as whether and what kind of exceptions should be made when implementing the sanction.

Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna [Estonia 200 party] says that one option with cars, which have Russian license plates and which will remain in Estonia after implementing the sanction, is to confiscate them. But if such step is taken, this too should be agreed with between states. It cannot be so that every EU member state beats up Russia according to its own standards, but some will not beat up all.

Here one should look at the statistics indicating that vehicles with Russian license plates are already now entering Estonia 17 times less than during the pre-pandemic time and before the start of Russia’s full-scale aggression in Ukraine. We are not talking about a mystically large number of cars, but it is clearly interesting that there are many vehicles meant for transporting passengers. Who precisely they belong to, Postimees could not find from the Estonian Tax and Customs Department before the newspaper went to press.  

Thursday’s newspaper also includes a story about oil and bitumen exports from Russia, when Estonia tried to implement its "own" sanction. Unfortunately this has been evaded and its impact is bigger than with sanctions for cars with Russian license plates. Hence it should be underscored that sanctions are still too soft and technically legal schemes are used disturbingly much. All of this enables the Russian war machine to keep on working.

Estonian NOC secretary general doubtful of Russian and Belarusian participation at Paris 2024

Estonian Olympic Committee (EOK) secretary general Siim Sukles believes that, even if Russia and Belarus are allowed to compete at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, very few athletes will meet the requirements.

Last week, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) suspended the Russian Olympic Committee's (ROC) membership.

This was done after the latter recognised Russian Olympic councils from the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia.

Despite this, the IOC stated that the suspension does not impact the two countries' potential to compete as neutrals in the French capital next year.

Currently, Russian and Belarusian teams are banned from international competition but individual athletes are able to participate as long as they are against the war in Ukraine and not affiliated with the military.

"If they get there at all, they will not be able to compete under the Russian flag, and their uniforms will have to be neutral," Sukles said, as reported by ETV.

The IOC suspended the ROC last week but claim it does not impact Russian athletes' potential of competing at Paris 2024, with a decision on this still yet to be made ©IOC[https://cdn.dmcl.biz/media/image/285568/o/IOC+Executive+Board+meeting+-+2023.jpg]

"I'm not sure that any Russian or a Belarusian athlete will get there at all, because let's also remind ourselves that the Russian media have already begun creating the paradigm according to which, [they] will not accept these humiliating conditions that require [them] to go to the Olympics without a uniform, without a flag and without an anthem.

"A position is already being established whereby the Russians can say 'we will not come at all'".

The IOC initiated the most recent sanction as it was a breach of the Olympic Charter.

For Sukles, he predicts further action to be taken by the IOC as the war shows no sign of slowing down.

"The most tangible outcome is that the IOC will suspend all projects related to the ROC," Sukles said.

"After the beginning of the war they already stopped all the money, but now they have been de jure told that they cannot use the name Russian Olympic Committee and they cannot use the Olympic rings.

"This is more of an emotional or value-based signal that we do not accept what the Russians have done in Ukraine."

Sanctions against Russia, the Israel-Hamas war and Balticconnector gas pipeline damage are among the main stories covered by Estonian newspapers and news websites on 20-23 October.

Editorial: Sanctions against Russia

The daily newspaper Eesti Paevaleht (EPL) says in an editorial that the European Commission is collecting ideas for new sanctions against Russia. The newspaper goes on to say that it would be good if sanctions against Russia were more effective but instead "we are seeing sanction breakers among companies and even state leaders". EPL says one must not lose hope and "instead continue fighting for increased sanctions against Russia". The newspaper says it is important to avoid a situation where the West starts thinking whether it should support only Ukraine or Israel. EPL emphasises "it is vitally important to support both Ukraine and Israel". The newspaper says when it comes to sanctions, it is important to find compromises with those who doubt and also to avoid Hungary's attempts to undermine sanctions against Russia. (Eesti Paevaleht, 22 October)

Israel-Hamas war

Security expert Erkki Koort writes in an opinion piece for the leading daily newspaper Postimees that the Israel-Hamas conflict will increase migration to Europe and will also increase the terrorism threat in Europe. He says Israel's invasion of Gaza will force civilians to move and he compares the situation to 2015 when Russia interfered in Syria, which led to a migration crisis in Europe. Koort says Israel will likely destroy most of the infrastructure in the Gaza sector. He notes it will force people to seek for a safe place. Koort says the events in the Middle East will make potential "terrorists" more active. He says "terrorists" will want to attack both Israel and its supporters. Koort says the crisis will result in something the Kremlin has hoped for: Europe will have to turn more attention to its own problems. (Postimees, 20 October)

Balticconnector gas pipeline damage

Eesti Paevaleht (EPL) reports that on the night the gas pipeline Balticconnector was damaged a Chinee cargo ship, along with a Russian state-owned ship, was close to it. EPL says the cargo ship NewNew Polar Bear was above the Balticconnector at the same time when a seismic incident was registered in the Baltic Sea. The newspaper notes the NewNew Polar Bear reduced its speed when it moved over the pipeline. EPL adds the NewNew Polar Bear is owned by NewNew Shipping which was established in September 2022. (Eesti Paevaleht, 21 October)

Editorial: PM's scandal

Postimees says in an editorial that Prime Minister Kaja Kallas "may end up in isolation as a result of her scandal". The newspaper says Kallas has still not understood what the problem was with her scandal. In August media revealed that Kallas's husband Arvo Hallik was a shareholder in a company that did business in Russia. Hallik sold his share and although major newspapers called on Kallas to resign, the prime minister refused to do it. Postimees says Kallas's coalition partners also do not wish to take her down. The newspaper says the scandal has created a problem both domestically and internationally. Postimees notes Kallas made herself look like a "moral beacon" on Ukraine's matters, but at the same time her husband's company was doing business in Russia. The newspaper says although Kallas's inner circle claims the scandal has not affected diplomatic relations, Postimees "has heard otherwise". Postimees says Kallas has allegedly no longer been included in one-to-one meetings with other heads of state during international summits. (Postimees, 20 October)

Estonian daily supports next EU anti-Russian sanctions package

The following is the text of an unattributed editorial entitled "Let us move towards the 12th sanctions package" and published by the daily newspaper Eesti Paevaleht on 22 October:

On Monday [23 October], the foreign ministers of the European Union meet in Luxembourg: obviously the main themes include the situation in Israel and Palestine, and Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. At the same time, the European Commission is collecting ideas and suggestions from member states on what the next package of anti-Russian sanctions could look like.

It is no wonder that the sequence number of the next sanctions package – 12 – makes one sarcastic. We would very much want the anti-Russian sanctions to be more impactful so that they would not allow the Russian war machine to operate for a long time. Instead, we are seeing sanctions evaders and opponents of sanctions from small-scale entrepreneurs all the way to the leaders of major corporations and heads of state. As well as the fact that to some extent, banned goods are still reaching Russia.

But in this imperfect world one should not lose hope or give up, but rather one should stand up for sanctions that would contain Russia even more. It is very important that the wars in Ukraine and Israel are not treated as entirely separate, lest a discussion may arise whether with limited resources either one or the other war should be supported.

No, it is of vital importance for democratic states to support both Ukraine and Israel because these two wars have a very practical link, not only on some high level of ideas. Deterring Iran would to some extent facilitate both the fights of Ukraine and Israel for their states. But more effective squeezing of Russia may also reduce pressure on Israel because the Kremlin would have less energy to incite supporters of Hamas and Hezbollah in Europe.

When speaking about the 12th sanctions package, Estonia has expressed the need for a joint European trade embargo, Lithuania has called for a ban on purchases of Russian uranium and LNG, several states are figuring out how to freeze Russian assets or to transfer profits from these assets without major legal risks to Ukraine. Also declaring Russian diamonds as banned goods is on the agenda both in G7 and the European Union.

All of these are good ideas. Simply said, compromises must be reached with sensible doubters (are we not hurting ourselves more than Russia with this or that sanction?) and a way should be found for overcoming the attempts of Viktor Orban, who has joined Putin’s camp, to undermine EU’s sanction policy.

Estonian PM: Sanctions against Russia work

TALLINN, Nov 08, BNS - The sanctions imposed on Russia work, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said during parliament questions time on Wednesday.

The sanctions must continue, the prime minister underlined. The Estonian government has also approved proposals to be submitted for a new package of sanctions.

"We propose to establish a full trade embargo precisely because it would be the easiest to control," Kallas said, adding that a lot of transit seemingly goes to Kyrgyzstan or other states, but there is reason to believe the goods actually end up in Russia instead.

"The talk of sanctions not working is not true. The real deficit of Russia's budget is about a third of the budget. They cannot compensate this deficit with loans from foreign markets, either," she noted, referring to Russia not being able to borrow money from abroad due to sanctions.

The premier underscored the importance of Russia being unable to get additional funds from financial markets. She pointed out that Russia has serious problems financing the expenses of the state budget, because its liquid reserves are running out.

"Excluding Russia from this is extremely effective as a sanction in Western financial markets. That's why it also affects their military industry, they are unable to finance it. We have to believe in it and push it further for these sanctions to be in place and apply pressure because as we can see, they indeed have an impact," she said.

Ukraine's victory is existential issue for the Baltics – Landsbergis in Tallinn

VILNIUS, Nov 24, BNS - Ukraine's victory is an existential issue not only for the Baltic states but also for the West, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said at the 29th Baltic Council meeting in Tallinn on Friday.

"In 2024, we will have to continue devoting a lot of time and effort to managing crises and preventing their consequences and aftermath. But even worse scenarios are possible, which could directly affect the security of the Baltic states. Today, they no longer seem unrealistic," Lithuania's top diplomat said. "At the moment, the rules-based order is being defended in Ukraine. Therefore, Ukraine's victory is an existential issue not only for the Baltic states but also for the West, and our support for Ukraine's fight is a top priority in the short term."

The signs of war fatigue are becoming more visible in the West's posture, he added.

"However, war fatigue is a phenomenon characteristic of societies living in peace. If war fatigue were to overwhelm Ukraine, it would cease to exist. We have to fight this as the West has the structural power to give Ukraine the support it needs to win," Landsbergis said.

The presence of US and NATO forces in the Baltic sates is a key element of the Baltic region's security and defense, he said.

"We must work towards a permanent US military presence in the Baltic region. But alliances must be mutually beneficial. Therefore, we must be where the US has its eyes on. We need to strengthen cooperation with like-minded partners in the India-Pacific region," Lithuania's top diplomat said.

He also stressed the need to continue putting pressure on Russia through sanctions and to remain active shapers of the EU sanction policy.

Yandex, barred from providing taxi service in Estonia due to sanctions, loses in court

TALLINN, Nov 29, BNS - The Tallinn Administrative Court has dismissed an appeal by which Russian taxi-hailing platform Yandex, which had to wind up its business in Estonia due to the sanctions imposed on Russia, challenged an order of Estonia's then foreign minister Eva-Maria Liimets, Postimees reported.

On March 31 last year, in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Estonian government approved a national sanction against Yandex, banning the company's activities in Estonia. As the reason for the move, Andres Sutt, the then minister of entrepreneurship and information technology, cited a recent Russian decision that Yandex is obliged to share the personal data it collects with the special services of Russia.

"The purpose of the sanction is to prevent the collection and exploitation of the data of Estonian users by the Russian intelligence services. In order to use the Yandex application, it is necessary to provide access to a large amount of personal data that is processed on the company's servers in Russia and that may be used in intelligence activities against Estonia and Europe. In the current political situation, this is a significant threat to Estonia's security," Sutt said at the time.

The ban on Yandex was enforced on April 11 last year by an order of the then foreign minister, Liimets. In their complaint to the Tallinn Administrative Court, Yandex N.V. and Ridetech International B.V., formerly known as Yandex.Taxi B.V., demanded the annulment of the order.

The court found that the government and the minister of foreign affairs had convincingly justified the application of the sanction to the companies of Yandex Group.

"Given that the sanction is a foreign policy measure, not a reaction to unlawful actions by the person designated as the subject of the particular sanction, the minister of foreign affairs did not have to identify in detail all the particulars relating to the economic activities and management of Yandex in order to issue the contested order. The circumstances on which the minister of foreign affairs proceeded in issuing the contested order were sufficient to impose the restrictions on the freedom to conduct a business which are the substance of the sanction," the court noted.

The business activity of Yandex.Taxi B.V. in Estonia, which in itself was legitimate, essentially meant generating revenue on the Estonian market for a group of companies of whose economic activity a significant part takes place in Russia.

By restricting its activities in Estonia, the sanction thus limits the revenue-generating opportunities of the Yandex group and, overall, harms the group's activities in Russia.

"In conclusion, the imposition of the sanction on Yandex cannot be considered arbitrary," the court added.

An appeal against the decision of the Tallinn Administrative Court can be filed with the Tallinn Circuit Court by Dec. 27 at the latest.

On April 1 last year, Yandex taxi drivers staged a demonstration against the ban on the company in front of the joint building of ministries in Tallinn.

Russia: Russia to participate in OSCE summit, Ukraine and Baltic countries to boycott

Poland blocked Russia's participation in 2022

Russia blocked Estonia's application for Chancellor position, Malta to be elected

North Macedonia and Bulgaria allowed the Russian delegation to arrive at the OSCE summit in Skopje. Following the decision, Ukraine and the Baltic States (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia) announced they will not attend the summit as Russia will try to disrupt its work. Last year Poland refused to accept the Russian delegation at the OSCE summit in Warsaw, claiming ForMin Lavrov is an EU-sanctioned person. Russia threatened to exit the organization in case not allowed to visit the summit this year. Russia also blocked Estonia's application for the Chancellor post in 2024, insisting that in the current circumstances only non-NATO countries can have this post, so now it is expected that Malta will be elected. The EU confirmed that Russia's participation is possible, as sanction restrictions do not apply to OSCE events. We do not expect any particularly important outcomes from the OSCE meeting, but it is still a small victory for the Russian diplomacy, which is now struggling to be represented at international events.

ESTONIA: RELEASE OF HUNGARY'S MONEY SHOWS SYSTEM WORKING

Vivian Loonela, head of the European Commission's Representation in Estonia, has said that the European Commission does not intend to simply comply with Hungary and release the frozen aid funds for the country. Instead, Hungary has amended its legal system according to the directives of the European Commission, demonstrating the system's effectiveness.

Loonela said that an important summit was coming up, where the European Commission had done everything on its part to adopt a decision to start accession talks with Ukraine.

"Ukraine funding - on one hand, for purchasing weapons, a peace fund for member states, from which we have already supported sending more weapons to Ukraine with nearly EUR 6 billion from European funds. We want to increase this by another EUR 5 billion. Secondly, the budget support to Ukraine, so they can maintain their country despite the hard times of war. The Commission has proposed creating a Ukraine fund, which would ensure they have EUR 50 billion over the next four years. In all this, we are waiting for the approval of the member states," Loonela said.

Hungary wants to sink the proposals. When asked if the credibility of the European Union was at stake, Loonela replied that this had been the case during all the recent crises, from which Europe had emerged stronger.

Understanding what Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban actually wanted was the objective, Loonela admitted.

"It does not seem to be so straightforward. European Council President Charles Michel visited Budapest, Orban had dinner with French President Macron - what exactly does he want, I cannot see into his head," she said.

It has been suggested that the European Commission might accommodate Hungary and release the EUR 10 billion in aid funds frozen due to their own rule-of-law breaches.

"This actually shows that our system works. I know it sounds strange. What is the issue with Hungary's cohesion funds? For the first time in EU history, a rule-of-law conditionality procedure was added to the framework, meaning that if member states saw and the Commission assessed that there were rule-of-law issues in a member state, then they could not access those designated funds. In the case of Hungary, we are talking about EUR 21 billion from the cohesion fund," Loonela explained.

"These directives that the Commission issued regarding the rule-of-law mechanism were about how judges were appointed - this system has been changed - how court cases were distributed among judges - today, the Hungarian parliament adopted a decision to now use a blind distribution system like in Estonia. This shows that if we are consistent, then indeed, the flaws pointed out in the legal system have been corrected," Loonela stated.

Orban has promised to veto the start of accession talks with Ukraine. According to Loonela, finding a solution to this remains in the hands of state leaders in their discussions.

Loonela stated that the European Union had strengthened with expansion, and the war in Ukraine had made it clear that the EU could not have any grey areas on its periphery. "They are either with us or taken over by Russia or China. There are no two ways about it."

That member states have different opinions on where the European Union should expand or what the conditions are is natural, according to Loonela.

Legally, changing treaties is not a precondition for expansion, Loonela says.

Russia continues to successfully import high-tech goods under sanctions. According to Loonela, the sanction policy is actually working. "Look at what is sanctioned - do you see Russian planes flying, trains running, Russian trucks driving? But of course, it could work better. How does the European Union's sanction policy work - we decide them unanimously, but then each member state is responsible for how their authorities ensure the sanctions are enforced."

Loonela acknowledged that transit through third countries was a concern, and the European Union had communicated with transit countries, resulting in reduced trade. China, however, is a separate case, although EU leaders have also emphasized to China the need to limit certain groups' supplies to Russia. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

Estonian MEP: Ukraine war increasingly coming off as an European affair elsewhere

ESTONIA: ONLY COMPLETE EMBARGO TO STOP TRADE WITH RUSSIA

Trade with Russia will not end until Western countries jointly agree on sanctions and impose a complete trade embargo, Chairman of the Riigikogu's Foreign Affairs Committee Marko Mihkelson (Reform) has said after it was revealed Estonian firms were still doing business in Russia.

The articles, published by Eesti Ekspress, detail how several companies and sectors have increased their growth during the full-scale invasion. One area is medicine, which is not under direct sanctions but supports Russia's economy and war effort.

"I think this is a wider problem - not just a problem in Estonia. We can see from the European Union how, in many countries, the numbers are either stable or have increased," Mihkelson said.

The MP said there were also big problems with areas under sanction, such as technology used in the military.

"The Ukrainians proved that the missiles they (Russia) produced last year still contained microchips and technology from Western companies. Unfortunately, this shows that there are huge gaps not only in conventional trade, but also in the sanctioned trade sectors. If there is not a full trade embargo, gaps will be found one way or another," Mihkelson said.

The chairman said companies that continued to trade products that were either directly or indirectly under sanctions must face strong moral judgment.

"Many Western companies have left Russia, but there are a number that have not. Recently, Apple paid a fine of more than $10 million to the Russian government. The picture is certainly more varied in that respect. I haven't had time to read in detail all the stories that have come out recently about the East, but it's very good to put this information in front of the reader, but you also have to understand the wider context," said Mihkelson.

"Today's world is not only influenced by the will of the West. There has been a huge increase in trade between China and Russia, through Turkey or Central Asia. Sanctions are being bypassed and ways are being found to continue trading. It is difficult even to agree on new sanctions at the EU level because some countries, such as Hungary, do not agree to tougher sanctions," he said.

"If it is not a question of sanctioned trade, then there is nothing but this kind of moral looking in the mirror. The Operail case is a very good example - if our neighbors do not come on board, we are the losers rather than Russia. Wisdom in implementing this policy is very much needed so that we do not shoot ourselves in the foot," the MP said.

Mihkelson said Estonia's task was to achieve this type of agreement at the EU level and in cooperation with the United States. Then it would be possible to create sanctions that have a real impact.

"The Financial Times reported that last year was the most profitable period for Russian banks. This shows that the sanctions that have been imposed so far are not having the effect of making Russia's war against Ukraine more expensive or preventing them from producing missiles," he said.

The politician said international attention is also being paid to transferring Russian frozen assets to Ukraine.

"There is certainly progress to be seen here. There is already talk of sending money earned as interest to Ukraine," said Mihkelson.

"All of this will work more effectively, in a way that will influence Russia more effectively, if we can act at the European Union level together with the United States. Russia, of course, is skilfully trying to influence the West through its closest countries of influence like Hungary. Since imposing sanctions is based on consensus, it is clear that we cannot get tougher because Hungary is opposed to it," Mihkelson said.

Former foreign minister Urmas Reinsalu said: "It makes sense for Estonia to try to reach an agreement with the Eastern border countries on restricting Russian trade. Specifically on national sanctions. This concerns the Baltic States, Finland and Poland."

"It is my fundamental view that Western countries should impose an embargo on Russia," the chairman of the opposition party Isamaa said.

"I think Isamaa will propose to Parliament to set up a committee of inquiry into this (Russia-related) transit and business," he added.

The MP said it was unacceptable if the Estonian state supported companies that continued doing business with Russia with funds from the state or the European Union.

"I think this is a very fundamental question of values. Here, the state can impose additional rules," Reinsalu said. (ERR/Business World Magazine)

Russia adds Estonia's Prime Minister to its 'wanted' list: Kaja Kallas joins ICC's British chief prosecutor, US senator Lindsey Graham and 93 UK nationals 'fighting with Ukrainian army'

* Estonia's prime minister Kaja Kallas is the first head of state to be sanctioned

* She joins several others, including the ICC's chief prosecutor, on the list

* She was sanctioned for allegedly destroying 'monuments to Soviet soldiers'

Estonia's prime minister Kaja Kallas has been added to Russia's wanted list for allegedly destroying 'monuments to Soviet soldiers.'

Kallas, 46, has become the first head of state to handed a criminal charge by Russian authorities and joins the International Criminal Court's British chief prosecutor, US senator Lindsay Graham - as well as 93 British nationals that Russia claims are fighting on the side of Ukraine in Vladimir Putin's continuing war.

She, and several other European officials from Baltic states, were added to the list on Tuesday over their alleged involvement in the destruction of Soviet-era war memorials.

The monuments, some of which commemorate the Red Army, had long been controversial in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and seen by many as symbols of their time under Soviet occupation.

The three Baltic states began removing and demolishing some of them in response to Russia's full-scale assault on Ukraine in 2022, prompting outrage in Moscow.

Kallas appeared on the Russian interior ministry's wanted list early on Tuesday, along with Estonian state secretary Taimar Peterkop and a number of other officials.

They were listed in connection with the 'destruction of monuments to Soviet soldiers', Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said.

'Crimes against the memory of the liberators of the world from Nazism and fascism must be punished. And this is just the beginning,' she added.

Russia has laws criminalizing the 'rehabilitation of Nazis' that include clauses punishing the desecration of war memorials, and Russia's Investigative Committee, the country's top criminal investigation agency, has a dedicated department to deal with alleged 'falsification of history' and 'rehabilitation of Nazism,' which has ramped up its action since the start of the war, according to Mediazona, an independent Russian news outlet that analysed the wanted list on Tuesday.

Kallas, a staunch critic of Russia and its Ukraine offensive, said the move was unsurprising.

'Their scare tactics won't change our actions,' she said.

Kallas joins the ranks of international figures who have been sanctioned by the Russian state since it invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

The ICC's British chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, was put on the list in May 2023, and is wanted for 'felony charges.'

He and three ICC judges had cases brought against them in Russia for committing 'signs of crimes' under Russian law.

In Khan's case, he was accused of accusing an innocent person of a crime. He was the prosecutor who successfully brought charges against Vladimir Putin at the ICC in April 2022, for the mass abduction of Ukrainian children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure in the country.

US senator Lindsey Graham, meanwhile, was charged under Russian law for comments he made while meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, without specifying what the crimes were.

During his visit to Kyiv, he told Zelensky that Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion reminded him of 'our better selves in America.'

'There was a time in America that we were this way, fighting to the last person, we were going to be free or die.'

Zelensky said in response: 'Now you are free'.

Graham replied: 'And the Russians are dying.'

After the sanction, Graham took to X and said: 'To know that my commitment to Ukraine has drawn the ire of [President Vladimir] Putin's regime brings me immense joy.'

'Come and make your best case. See you in The Hague!'

Along with major figures, 93 British have been charged for fighting alongside Ukrainian forces.

Russia's defence ministry claimed last year 635 foreigners from 47 countries across the world were helping Ukraine's war effort.

A speech by Estonia's foreign minister, European security, and trade with Russia are among the main stories covered by Estonian newspapers and news websites on 13-14 February 2024

Editorial: Foreign minister's speech

Leading daily newspaper Postimees says in its editorial that Foreign Affairs Minister Margus Tsahnka's (Estonia 200 party) speech to the parliament was "too idealistic". The newspaper goes on the minister is right about supporting Ukraine, but he views the international situation "through rose-tinted glasses". Postimees says the international situation is becoming worse and Tsahkna should come up with ideas for a plan B if the USA were to become more isolated again, as has happened in the past. The newspaper says there is also need for a plan "in case the war in Ukraine goes seriously sideways". Postimees adds the question is what the solution for these situations will be. (Postimees, 13 February)

Editorial: Europe's security

Europe must do more for its security, says the daily newspaper Eesti Paevaleht (EPL) in its editorial. The newspaper points out US ex-president Donald Trump recently called on Russia to attack Nato countries that spend less than two percent of their GDP on defence. EPL notes Trump has a good chance of becoming president again and such statements "should be taken as a wake-up call that US military support is not self-evident". The newspaper says European leaders have begun to understand the changing security situation. "Admitting danger is the first step in combating it, but words alone are not enough," says EPL. The newspaper praises Poland for increasing the size of its army while pointing out that several Western European Nato members are not spending enough on defence. Europe must act quickly, EPL adds. (Eesti Paevaleht, 13 February)

Trade with Russia

Weekly newspaper Eesti Ekspress reports that there are four possibilities to halt trade with Russia and stop Russia's war machine. Jonatan Vseviov, secretary general at the Foreign Affairs Ministry, indicates that Estonia wants the West to introduce a complete embargo against Russia. The newspaper says one possibility to stop Moscow would be to ban all trade with Russia. Ekspress says another option is to ban transit through Russia. The third option, the newspaper notes, is to sanction companies doing business with Russia. Ekspress says the fourth possibility is to close all borders with Russia. Vseviov says Estonia has not closed its border with Russia because it is a "radical measure", but Estonia's geographical location gives it a somewhat stronger position in negotiating with allies in the European Union. (Eesti Ekspress, 13 February)

Opinion: Tensions in ruling party

Journalist Urmas Jaagant writes in an opinion piece for Eesti Ekspress that the tensions between Prime Minister Kaja Kallas (Reform Party) and her fellow party member MEP Andrus Ansip are a rerun of a "show" which took place 12 years ago. Jaagant recalls that in November 2012 the Reform Party, then led by Prime Minister Andrus Ansip, gathered to discuss their alleged forbidden donations scandal and also the matter regarding Kaja Kallas. Jaagant notes Kallas was then publicly criticising the Reform Party leadership and it bothered Ansip. He says now Ansip is criticising how Kallas is leading the party and Kallas has sent a letter to fellow party members where she called on Ansip not to run again to the European Parliament. Jaagant says this means "there are no friends in politics - not even among your own people". (Eesti Ekspress, 14 February)
