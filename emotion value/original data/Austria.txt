VIENNA, February 21 (Sputnik) - Preventive sanctions against Russia cannot and should not be implemented without Moscow launching the feared "invasion" of Ukraine, Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said before the summit of the European Union foreign ministers earlier Monday.

On February 17, EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell said that a draft package of sanctions against Russia was put in place to be triggered in the event of escalation around Ukraine.

“Sanctions are a reaction, some kind of punishment​​​. They cannot and should not be implemented beforehand. In the European Union , we said that we would react to an act of aggression proportionally, and we must follow it. I regard it right not to disclose in detail how this sanction package will look like,” the minister said.

Schallenberg also noted that a misinformation campaign has been launched around the situation in Donbas.

“Since 2015, an immense increase of violations has been detected on the contact line, but, unfortunately, it was in the past years also – this is not a military aggression of Russia,” the minister added.

The precarious situation in a breakaway Donbas deteriorated in recent days, with the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics claiming that the Ukrainian armed forces had shelled their positions. The Ukrainian security forces also reported a sharp increase in the number of ceasefire violations in Donbas, while denying any offensive actions.

In 2014, the Ukrainian authorities launched a military operation against the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and its neighboring Luhansk People's Republic after they declared independence and refused to recognize the new central government. Early clashes escalated into a protracted military conflict that claimed thousands of lives, including 3,095 civilians, and displaced over 2 million Ukrainians. A ceasefire was reached in 2020, but fighting occasionally breaks out.

 In the past few months, Western countries and Ukraine have accused Russia of deploying additional troops along the Ukrainian border in alleged preparation for invasion. Moscow has repeatedly dismissed these allegations, saying that it has no intention of invading Ukraine, while stressing that it has the right to move its troops within its territory.

Russia has also expressed concerns over NATO military activity near its borders and ongoing military support of Ukraine, including an increase in the number of Western military advisers in the breakaway Donbas region and increased arms deliveries to Kiev.

Nehammer expects third EU sanction package against Russia

Kiev/Moscow/Brussels - The EU is due to work on further punitive measures against Russia after the sanction package was passed at an EU summit on Thursday. "One assumes there will be a third package, which will [specifically target] those who actualy have power and influence in the Kremlin", said Chancellor Karl Nehammer (conservative People's Party, VP) on Friday after talks in Brussels.

A further sanction package was also discussed, as the "force of the Russian Federation's aggression was far beyond expectations when the sanction package was being prepared", said Nehammer.

The sanctions passed at the summit would already hit Russia hard, said the Austrian chancellor, and they were due to be completed on Friday.

They were targeting advanced technology, aviation, space technology, seafaring, and the oil industry. Three quarters of Russian aviation came from the European Union. "A complete stop of replacement part deliveries was mandated", said Nehammer. Machines could no longer be serviced. Visa privileges for Russian diplomats were also suspended.

70 percent of Russian banks were affected by severe EU sanctions, said Nehammer. The other 30 percent were smaller banks and less relevant. In a discussion about the international payment system Swift, experts said that excluding Russia would not lead to any success.

Slovenia's suggestion that Ukraine should join the EU was not discussed, said Nehammer. "An early EU accession would not help Ukraine, and not help the European Union, as the systems are so different".

TEHRAN, Feb. 25 (MNA) – Spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Behrouz Kamalvandi met and held talks with top Russian negotiations in sanction removal talks in Vienna.

In a tweet on Monday, Russia’s Permanent Representative to the Vienna-based International Organizations Mikhail Ulyanov wrote, "The chief Iranian negotiator at the #ViennaTalks on #JCPOA Dr. Ali Bagheri Kani is in Tehran now",

"But his colleagues stay in Vienna. Met today with Deputy Head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of #Iran Mr.B. Kamalvandi and Deputy Foreign Minister Mr. R. Najafi", said Ulyanov.

Spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Behrouz Kamalvandi has traveled to the Austrian capital of Vienna for technical consultations between Iran and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Iran’s top negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani also met and held talks with the Director-General of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi in the Austrian capital of Vienna on Feb. 16.

Referring to his meeting with Ali Bagheri Kani, IAEA Chief in a tweet wrote, "Had an important conversation today with Iran’s chief negotiator @Bagheri_Kani, on current bilateral issues between @IAEAorg & #Iran and also on ongoing #JCPOA discussions."

"Being near the finish line is no guarantee to crossing that. It requires extra caution, much perseverance, additional creativity, and balanced approach to take the last step", tweeted Bagheri Kani, who arrived in Tehran Wednesday on a short trip from Vienna.

1650 ET - S&P Global Ratings on Friday said it was revising its outlook on Austria to positive and affirming the country's 'AA+/A-1+' ratings. S&P said the revised outlook reflects its view that "Austria's economic growth outlook should remain broadly resilient over 2022-2025." S&P said it expects Austria's economy to grow 4.1% this year, and grow 1.7% during 2023-2025 "on the back of robust domestic demand." S&P also said it expects faster budgetary consolidation in Austria, adding it sees the country's budget deficit at about 0.8% of GDP by 2025. S&P said its outlook signifies "we could raise our rating on Austria within the next 24 months if its budgetary performance improves beyond our current expectations." (stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com)

1648 ET - The IPC stock index closes up 2.1% at 52556 points. Televisa shares close up 3.5% following 4Q results. Co-CEO Alfonso Angoitia tells analysts the company plans capital expenditures of $860M this year, including $620M to pass 700K homes with fiber and boost subscriptions in its cable division. Restaurant operator Alsea shares rise 8.8% after strong 4Q results with sales above pre-pandemic levels. The peso firms to 20.35 against the US dollar from 20.56 yesterday. Statistics institute Inegi revised 4Q GDP up to flat from a previous 0.1% contraction, including a solid 0.8% rise in December activity. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)

1631 ET - 16:22 ET - The WSJ Dollar Index is trading 0.4% lower on the day, but gains 0.3% for the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has, aside from the ruble, so far had a limited effect on currency markets, Capital Economics ' Jonas Goltermann says. The US dollar and other safe havens rose sharply on news of the invasion, he says. "But safe haven flows have partly unwound over the past 24 hours as risk sentiment has recovered, perhaps because the sanction packages unveiled by the US, EU, and UK were less extensive than might have been expected, and excluded the crucial Russian energy sector." Expectations that the war may end swiftly also appear to be growing, he adds. (jonathan.vuocolo@wsj.com; @jonvuocolo)

1610 ET - Mexico posts a $4.9B current account deficit in 2021, equivalent to 0.4% of GDP, compared with a surplus of $26.2B or 2.4% of GDP in 2020. The main reason for the swing to a deficit, the Bank of Mexico says, was a significant reduction in the nonpetroleum goods trade surplus and widening of the petroleum deficit, offset in part by record remittances and a pickup in tourism receipts. Goldman Sachs sees more risk in the capital account, noting $41.6B in portfolio investment outflows last year compared with outflows of $10.3B in 2020, while foreign direct investment in Mexico rose to $31.6B from $27.9B. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)

1555 ET - Treasury yields rise as the invasion of Ukraine is perceived as insufficient to derail monetary tightening. The 10 year gains 0.054 percentage point this week to close at 1.984%, after falling to an intraday low of 1.85% yesterday, at the peak of the risk-off sentiment triggered by the attack. But inflation concerns overcame fears of an economic slowdown halting central banks' actions. "Energy's contribution appears unlikely to recede as quickly, and record prices for food-related commodities will keep consumers grimacing at the grocery checkout line for months to come," Wells Fargo says. "Pressure on the FOMC to tighten policy significantly this year will remain in place." (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

1359 ET - Brazil's economy grew 0.4% in 4Q from 3Q, snapping a two-quarter streak of contractions, according to online brokerage XP Investimentos. Brazil's statistics agency will publish its report on the quarter's gross domestic product on Mar. 4. A recovery of the services sector and an increase in agricultural production more than offset an ongoing contraction in the industrial sector, XP said. A surge in imports in the quarter probably resulted in a negative contribution from the external sector, the brokerage said. XP estimates Brazil's GDP expanded 4.6% in 2021 from 2020. Coming quarters are likely to show a weakening of domestic activity, and the brokerage said it expects little change in GDP in 2022 from 2021. (jeffrey.lewis@wsj.com)

1249 ET - The dollar weakens 0.5% against the euro and rises 0.1% against the yen. The WSJ Dollar Index falls 0.3% following a big 1% gain yesterday. Bank of America says there are higher, flatter and even inverted implied-volatility curves due to the Russia-Ukraine crisis. "More relevant for medium-term FX volatility is its correlation with US real rate volatility that has risen to its highest in years, as price-inelastic TIPS buying by the Fed ends. The rise in FX vol may be more durable. USD appreciation may have further to run.... Markets are lurching from one Ukraine headline to another, but central banks fighting inflation are still key. We hold our USD-positive outlook among the majors, including our year-end EUR-USD forecast of 1.10." EUR/USD is at 1.1242. (jonathan.vuocolo@wsj.com; @jonvuocolo)

1205 ET - The war in Ukraine doesn't seem to be derailing monetary policy, Deutsche Bank says citing pricing data for the next live meetings of the Fed and the BoE , in March, and the ECB in September. "Whilst pricing is unsurprisingly off the highs, it is notable that the risks of 50bps are reduced but not entirely, in the case of the Fed and BoE. Nor has it significantly delayed the risk of ECB lift off later this year," Deutsche Bank says. "Given inflation remains elevated, this could potentially lead to central banks erring on the side of caution in the near term, but not change the ultimate course of action," Deutsche Bank says.

1150 ET - Speculative bets on sterling falling versus the Canadian dollar is the best hedge for uncertainty over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, TD Securities says. CAD is insulated against the Russia-Ukraine crisis to some degree given the prospect of the Bank of Canada raising interest rates at its March 2 meeting and favorable terms of trade due to higher oil prices, TD analysts say. For the pound, however, the crisis raises questions over how many rate hikes the Bank of England will deliver, they say. "The surge in energy and gas prices also represents a drag to the terms of trade and trade dynamics of Europe while favoring North America." GBP/CAD drops 0.4% to a three-and-a-half-week low of 1.7073, according to FactSet . (renae.dyer@wsj.com)

1038 ET - The euro recovers some of Thursday's losses versus the dollar but the exchange rate faces renewed weakness on the back of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Unicredit 's research team says. "The eurozone will likely be hurt more than the US by the current Russia/Ukraine crisis, given its implications on growth, inflation, and monetary-policy strategies," Unicredit analysts say. The dollar will also be supported by safe haven flows, they say. EUR/USD could fall below 1.10, they say. EUR/USD rises 0.4% to 1.1244 after hitting a 20-month low of 1.1108 on Thursday, according to FactSet . (renae.dyer@wsj.com)

1035 ET - Allianz is monitoring the situation in Ukraine and is prepared for all scenarios, a company spokeswoman says. "We are actively prepared for all operational and financial outcomes, including market reactions, business continuity and adaptability, and readiness to comply with emerging sanctions and regulations," the German insurer says. All of Allianz 's insurance business lines have a presence in Russia, as do its global lines Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty , AZ Partners and Euler Hermes , it says. In Ukraine, Allianz has a smaller property & casualty insurance unit. With regards to its investments, Allianz says the share of Russian sovereign bonds in its portfolio is very low, and that it implemented an exposure freeze on such assets weeks ago.

1029 ET - As the war in Ukraine scrambles the economic outlook, US data indicate the year started with bullish prospects. Durable goods orders beat expectations and rose 1.6% in January, including a 0.9% increase in nondefense capital goods. "That should pretty much guarantee a substantial acceleration in the business equipment spending component of real GDP in Q1 after a small rise in Q4," Amherst Pierpont says. "Unless the Ukraine situation causes much more of a drag...the Fed can add robust economic growth in demand in the first half of 2022 to the boiling inflation situation."

1823 ET - Mexican payroll lender Credito Real says it's hired Jefferies as a financial advisor to help build a restructuring plan that would "avoid burdensome legal proceedings," and maintain the value of the company following its recent default on a Swiss bond. Credito Real also explained that its planned refinancing of the maturing bond didn't materialize because existing solutions would have affected "among other areas liquidity and financial strength," and would have compromised Credito Real 's "long-term business viability." The company said it would attempt to operate its business as usual despite the recent bond default by prioritizing loan originations in its payroll lending business, as well as divest noncore businesses to raise additional funds.

1705 ET - Moody's Investors Service places Russia's and Ukraine's ratings on review for downgrade. Moody's says it's reviewing Russia's Baa3 long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings, among others. Moody's also says it's reviewing Ukraine's B3 foreign- and domestic-currency long-term issuer ratings and foreign-currency senior unsecured rating. The reviews were triggered by Russia's further military operation in Ukraine, which started yesterday, Moody's says. The effect of sanctions on Russia's credit profile will depend on their scope, what sectors are targeted and the degree of coordination by Western countries, Moody's says. An extensive conflict could pose a risk to the Ukrainian government's liquidity and external positions, according to Moody's . (stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com)

1205 ET - The war in Ukraine doesn't seem to be derailing monetary policy, Deutsche Bank says citing pricing data for the next live meetings of the Fed and the BoE , in March, and the ECB in September. "Whilst pricing is unsurprisingly off the highs, it is notable that the risks of 50bps are reduced but not entirely, in the case of the Fed and BoE. Nor has it significantly delayed the risk of ECB lift off later this year," Deutsche Bank says. "Given inflation remains elevated, this could potentially lead to central banks erring on the side of caution in the near term, but not change the ultimate course of action," Deutsche Bank says.

1150 ET - Speculative bets on sterling falling versus the Canadian dollar is the best hedge for uncertainty over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, TD Securities says. CAD is insulated against the Russia-Ukraine crisis to some degree given the prospect of the Bank of Canada raising interest rates at its March 2 meeting and favorable terms of trade due to higher oil prices, TD analysts say. For the pound, however, the crisis raises questions over how many rate hikes the Bank of England will deliver, they say. "The surge in energy and gas prices also represents a drag to the terms of trade and trade dynamics of Europe while favoring North America." GBP/CAD drops 0.4% to a three-and-a-half-week low of 1.7073, according to FactSet . (renae.dyer@wsj.com)

1038 ET - The euro recovers some of Thursday's losses versus the dollar but the exchange rate faces renewed weakness on the back of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Unicredit 's research team says. "The eurozone will likely be hurt more than the US by the current Russia/Ukraine crisis, given its implications on growth, inflation, and monetary-policy strategies," Unicredit analysts say. The dollar will also be supported by safe haven flows, they say. EUR/USD could fall below 1.10, they say. EUR/USD rises 0.4% to 1.1244 after hitting a 20-month low of 1.1108 on Thursday, according to FactSet . (renae.dyer@wsj.com)

1705 ET - Moody's Investors Service places Russia's and Ukraine's ratings on review for downgrade. Moody's says it's reviewing Russia's Baa3 long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings, among others. Moody's also says it's reviewing Ukraine's B3 foreign- and domestic-currency long-term issuer ratings and foreign-currency senior unsecured rating. The reviews were triggered by Russia's further military operation in Ukraine, which started yesterday, Moody's says. The effect of sanctions on Russia's credit profile will depend on their scope, what sectors are targeted and the degree of coordination by Western countries, Moody's says. An extensive conflict could pose a risk to the Ukrainian government's liquidity and external positions, according to Moody's . (stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com)

1650 ET - S&P Global Ratings on Friday said it was revising its outlook on Austria to positive and affirming the country's 'AA+/A-1+' ratings. S&P said the revised outlook reflects its view that "Austria's economic growth outlook should remain broadly resilient over 2022-2025." S&P said it expects Austria's economy to grow 4.1% this year, and grow 1.7% during 2023-2025 "on the back of robust domestic demand." S&P also said it expects faster budgetary consolidation in Austria, adding it sees the country's budget deficit at about 0.8% of GDP by 2025. S&P said its outlook signifies "we could raise our rating on Austria within the next 24 months if its budgetary performance improves beyond our current expectations." (stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com)

1648 ET - The IPC stock index closes up 2.1% at 52556 points. Televisa shares close up 3.5% following 4Q results. Co-CEO Alfonso Angoitia tells analysts the company plans capital expenditures of $860M this year, including $620M to pass 700K homes with fiber and boost subscriptions in its cable division. Restaurant operator Alsea shares rise 8.8% after strong 4Q results with sales above pre-pandemic levels. The peso firms to 20.35 against the US dollar from 20.56 yesterday. Statistics institute Inegi revised 4Q GDP up to flat from a previous 0.1% contraction, including a solid 0.8% rise in December activity. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)

1631 ET - 16:22 ET - The WSJ Dollar Index is trading 0.4% lower on the day, but gains 0.3% for the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has, aside from the ruble, so far had a limited effect on currency markets, Capital Economics ' Jonas Goltermann says. The US dollar and other safe havens rose sharply on news of the invasion, he says. "But safe haven flows have partly unwound over the past 24 hours as risk sentiment has recovered, perhaps because the sanction packages unveiled by the US, EU, and UK were less extensive than might have been expected, and excluded the crucial Russian energy sector." Expectations that the war may end swiftly also appear to be growing, he adds. (jonathan.vuocolo@wsj.com; @jonvuocolo)

1610 ET - Mexico posts a $4.9B current account deficit in 2021, equivalent to 0.4% of GDP, compared with a surplus of $26.2B or 2.4% of GDP in 2020. The main reason for the swing to a deficit, the Bank of Mexico says, was a significant reduction in the nonpetroleum goods trade surplus and widening of the petroleum deficit, offset in part by record remittances and a pickup in tourism receipts. Goldman Sachs sees more risk in the capital account, noting $41.6B in portfolio investment outflows last year compared with outflows of $10.3B in 2020, while foreign direct investment in Mexico rose to $31.6B from $27.9B. (anthony.harrup@wsj.com)

1555 ET - Treasury yields rise as the invasion of Ukraine is perceived as insufficient to derail monetary tightening. The 10 year gains 0.054 percentage point this week to close at 1.984%, after falling to an intraday low of 1.85% yesterday, at the peak of the risk-off sentiment triggered by the attack. But inflation concerns overcame fears of an economic slowdown halting central banks' actions. "Energy's contribution appears unlikely to recede as quickly, and record prices for food-related commodities will keep consumers grimacing at the grocery checkout line for months to come," Wells Fargo says. "Pressure on the FOMC to tighten policy significantly this year will remain in place." (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

1359 ET - Brazil's economy grew 0.4% in 4Q from 3Q, snapping a two-quarter streak of contractions, according to online brokerage XP Investimentos. Brazil's statistics agency will publish its report on the quarter's gross domestic product on Mar. 4. A recovery of the services sector and an increase in agricultural production more than offset an ongoing contraction in the industrial sector, XP said. A surge in imports in the quarter probably resulted in a negative contribution from the external sector, the brokerage said. XP estimates Brazil's GDP expanded 4.6% in 2021 from 2020. Coming quarters are likely to show a weakening of domestic activity, and the brokerage said it expects little change in GDP in 2022 from 2021. (jeffrey.lewis@wsj.com)

1249 ET - The dollar weakens 0.5% against the euro and rises 0.1% against the yen. The WSJ Dollar Index falls 0.3% following a big 1% gain yesterday. Bank of America says there are higher, flatter and even inverted implied-volatility curves due to the Russia-Ukraine crisis. "More relevant for medium-term FX volatility is its correlation with US real rate volatility that has risen to its highest in years, as price-inelastic TIPS buying by the Fed ends. The rise in FX vol may be more durable. USD appreciation may have further to run.... Markets are lurching from one Ukraine headline to another, but central banks fighting inflation are still key.

1035 ET - Allianz is monitoring the situation in Ukraine and is prepared for all scenarios, a company spokeswoman says. "We are actively prepared for all operational and financial outcomes, including market reactions, business continuity and adaptability, and readiness to comply with emerging sanctions and regulations," the German insurer says. All of Allianz 's insurance business lines have a presence in Russia, as do its global lines Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty , AZ Partners and Euler Hermes , it says. In Ukraine, Allianz has a smaller property & casualty insurance unit. With regards to its investments, Allianz says the share of Russian sovereign bonds in its portfolio is very low, and that it implemented an exposure freeze on such assets weeks ago.

The Duke of Sussex has acknowledged the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and called for global support for the country's people.

"Before I begin, we would like to acknowledge the people of Ukraine who urgently need our support as a global community," Harry said as he and Meghan appeared in person at the 53rd annual NAACP Image awards in Los Angeles.

The pair accepted the President's Award, which recognises special achievement and distinguished public service.

Australia may provide Ukraine with military support through Nato after previously only committing to non-lethal aid as well as sanctions against Russia.

"I've just spoken to the Defence Minister and we'll be seeking to provide whatever support we can for lethal aid through our Nato partners, particularly the US and the UK," Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday.

"We'll be working through those channels because that's the most effective way to do it," he added to reporters, after attending a church service with Ukrainian Australians in Sydney.

First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford has appeared to criticise the Home Office over its announcement that Ukrainians in the UK will be able to extend or switch their visas.

Mr Drakeford told BBC Breakfast: "There's a slightly grudging spirit in the Home Office's announcement, on simply talking about 'concessions' being made to people who are already here.

"As the position clarifies, we will need to go beyond that.

"It isn't just the actions themselves, it's the spirit in which they're made that will be important to establish our reputation as a country which - in the face of these enormously disturbing events - is prepared to play our part in responding to those people who are at the very sharpest end of it all."

Ireland will close off its airspace to all Russian aircraft, the Foreign Affairs minister has said.

On Sunday morning, Simon Coveney confirmed that Ireland will move to shut off Irish airspace to Russian planes.

He tweeted: "Shocking Russian attacks on Ukraine overnight. Ireland will move to shut off Irish airspace to all Russian aircraft.

"We encourage other EU partners to do the same. We also support new wide-ranging sanctions to be agreed today at EU FAC & new assistance package for Ukraine."

The Ministry of Defence tweeted an intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine, saying: "Ukrainian forces have engaged the remnants of Russian irregular forces within the city of Kyiv for the second night in a row, fighting has been at a lower intensity than the previous evening.

"After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces are bypassing the area in order to prioritise the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv.

"Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv.

"Russian forces are continuing to advance into Ukraine from multiple axis but are continuing to be met with stiff resistance from the Ukrainian armed forces."

Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy has said visa restrictions for those seeking sanctuary in the UK from Ukraine are "totally unacceptable".

Speaking to Sky on Trevor Phillips on Sunday, he said it is "bureaucratic" with a "lot of red tape".

Mr Lammy went on: "It's insisting that people demonstrate salaries, that they have family ties in this country.

"People are fleeing with their children in their arms. Why would you ask people how rich they are to enter our country? Of course, there are some people who may not have family ties, but want to come into this country.

"No, we should have a scheme and a process similar to the scheme that we had after the Balkans. That's as generous as the schemes that we've had in the past, when we allowed people to flee Idi Amin from Uganda, when we allowed people to flee Cyprus, when we allowed the Vietnamese boat people to enter our country.

"That's the sort of generosity that the British people expect. Frankly, suggesting that people should use this scheme that effectively fruit pickers come to this country on is totally, totally unacceptable."

Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy has said Russia's ambassador to the UK should leave the country after telling "lie after lie".

It came after Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Government should order Andrei Kelin to leave the country immediately.

Speaking to Sky on Trevor Phillips on Sunday, Mr Lammy said: "He (Mr Kelin) came to Parliament a few weeks ago and we asked him what is Russia doing with troops on the border? He denied that Russia was building troops.

"Has Russia got plans to come into the country? He said 'no, they do not want to invade Ukraine'.

"We've had lie after lie."

He went on: "It's time for him to leave our country."

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said more than 200,000 people have arrived in neighbouring countries from Ukraine.

It added: "Numbers are constantly being updated ... We aim to have another update later today."

Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy has said more major Russian banks should be included within the UK's sanctions on the country.

Speaking to Sky on Trevor Phillips on Sunday, he said: "There should be more banks listed. We can't understand why it's still the case that there are major Russian banks that are not subject to sanctions.

"We've raised issues about the sectors including insurance to be included. It should not be possible for Vladimir Putin to effectively de-risk his war escapade in Ukraine.

"We're concerned about family members of some of those oligarchs. There are names on the US list that are not on the UK list.

"Why aren't we banning the export of luxury goods? Those are the issues that were raising this morning and that we will scrutinise with the Government when they bring forward their further plans for sanctions in Parliament tomorrow."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has warned that President Vladimir Putin could use "the most unsavoury means" in order to secure victory in Ukraine.

With the Russian advance on Kyiv apparently slowed, Ms Truss said she feared Moscow could use "even worse weapons" to break the Ukrainian resistance.

"This could well be the beginning of the end for Putin. I fear that he is prepared to use the most unsavoury means in this war," she told Sky News.

"He should be aware the International Criminal Court is already looking at what is happening in Ukraine. There will be serious consequences for him and for the Russian government."

Asked about Russia's arsenal of chemical, nuclear and biological weapons, she said: "I fear this conflict could be very, very bloody.

"I urge the Russians not to escalate this conflict but we do need to be prepared for Russia to seek to use even worse weapons. I think it would be hugely devastating.

"We need to avoid this at all costs. This is why it is so important, the work we are doing to degrade the Russian military complex."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said the Government is drawing up a "hit list" of Russian oligarchs associated with Vladimir Putin to be targeted with sanctions.

Ms Truss told Sky News's Trevor Phillips on Sunday programme: "This week we will be introducing the Economic Crime Bill which will create a lot more transparency around the structure of these companies and make it much clearer what is going on.

"There are over 100 billionaires in Russian. We have compiled a hit list of oligarchs. We are working through and putting the cases together, and every few weeks we will sanction new oligarchs.

"We will go through the hit list. We will be targeting oligarchs' private jets, we will be targeting their properties, we will be targeting other possessions that they have and there will be nowhere to hide."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has warned there could be a conflict between Russia and Nato if Vladimir Putin is not stopped in Ukraine.

Ms Truss told Sky News's Trevor Phillips on Sunday programme that there will be an "economic cost" in Britain but that it was a price the country had to be prepared to pay.

"This long-running conflict is about freedom and democracy in Europe," she said.

"If we don't stop Putin in Ukraine we are going to see others under threat - the Baltics, Poland, Moldova, and it could end up in a conflict with Nato.

"We do not want to go there. That is why it is so important we make the sacrifices now.

"Yes, there will be an economic cost here in Britain, there will be a cost in terms of access to oil and gas markets. I firmly believe that the British public understand the price we will pay if we don't stand up to Putin now."

Ukraine's ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko said he believes his country will hold out out for "as long as needed".

He told BBC's Sunday Morning programme with Sophie Raworth: "We're holding. It's been just four days. I believe that we'll hold as long as needed."

He said "we have friends, we have support", adding that he believes Russia has "miscalculated".

Mr Prystaiko said: "They came with 150,000 troops. It's totally not enough."

He said Russia believed Ukraine would be an "easy target", adding that that is not the case.

"The whole nation is against them," he said.

Ukraine's ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko said many Ukrainians have military backgrounds and that people are "prepared".

He told BBC's Sunday Morning programme with Sophie Raworth: "People know how to create simple weapons.

"We're not talking about complicated machinery, but simple weapons."

He said 18,000 rifles that have been handed out have not yet been registered.

The ambassador said they have to fight "right now", adding they can be registered later "when we win".

Ukraine's ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko has said neighbouring nations to Ukraine have "opened up their hearts and homes" to receive as many Ukrainians as possible.

"That's easier for immediate evacuation," he told BBC's Sunday Morning programme with Sophie Raworth.

He said nations further away will be asked to financially help smaller nations in their efforts.

President Vladimir Putin is "not achieving what he wanted", Ukraine's ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko has said.

Asked if he is concerned that Mr Putin's tactics will become even more severe, Mr Prystaiko told BBC's Sunday Morning programme with Sophie Raworth: "Obviously we do, because he's not achieving what he wanted."

He said it took "too long" for many nations to respond with sanctions, adding that what Germany is now offering "might not be enough" or "too late".

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said the Government is "urgently" looking at what more it can do to enable refugees from the fighting in Ukraine to come to Britain.

The Government has faced intense criticism over its failure so far to relax the visa requirements for Ukrainian nationals.

Ms Truss told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: "It is a desperate situation.

"Of course, Britain has always welcomed refugees fleeing from war and we are urgently looking at what more we can do to facilitate that."

Ms Truss said the UK and other Western allies would continue to impose fresh sanctions on Moscow.

"We need to stop Putin's ambitions in Ukraine. There are dire consequences if we don't for freedom and democracy across Europe," she said.

"We will continue to tighten the ratchet on Vladimir Putin, to tighten the ratchet on the economy."

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said she would support British nationals who chose to go fight alongside the Ukrainian forces against the Russian invasion.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has promised to arm foreign volunteers to travel to his country to join the battle against Vladimir Putin's forces.

Asked on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme if she would support UK citizens who chose to answer the call, Ms Truss said: "That is something people can make their own decisions about.

"The people of Ukraine are fighting for freedom and democracy, not just for Ukraine but for the whole of Europe.

"Absolutely, if people want to support that struggle I would support them in doing that."

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has updated its estimate on the number of refugees that have left Ukraine, saying the total stands at 368,000.

It said in a tweet: "Ukraine refugee numbers have just been refreshed - these are based on data made available by national authorities. The current total is now 368,000 and continues to rise."

The Irish Foreign Affairs Minister has said he hopes the world is seeing the "first step" towards the ending of war, after the Ukraine president's office said Ukrainian envoys will meet with Russian diplomats as the country's troops draw closer to Kyiv.

Simon Coveney tweeted: "Let's hope this can be a first step to ending Russia's war against Ukraine.

"But be clear, EU foreign ministers meet tonight to increase targeted sanctions against Russia for unjustifiable aggression & to substantially increase our support for Ukraine."

A Ukrainian has said she was left "shaking" as she read Vladimir Putin's statement that he has placed Russia's nuclear deterrent on alert.

Anna Proskurnina is in the city of Kharkiv, 25 miles from the Russian border, where she said residents have been asked "not to go outside under any circumstances" amid heavy shelling over the weekend.

On Mr Putin's statement, the 24-year-old told the PA news agency: "(It) sounds like the beginning of World War Three... my hands are shaking."

The freelance artist said she and her family had wanted to flee Kharkiv on Thursday, but her father's car broke down so they are now waiting for an opportunity to escape.

"I eventually convinced (my parents) to move to Canada via Poland once it all ends, because when it does, I don't want to live next to Russia ever again," she added.

In a statement, BP said Russia's attack on Ukraine represented a "fundamental change" in how the company could operate there.

Rosneft is also part-owned by the Russian government, and BP has held a 19.75% stake in the firm since 2013.

BP said its chief executive Bernard Looney and its other Rosneft director Bob Dudley would both be resigning from Rosneft's board.

BP chairman Helge Lund said: "Russia's attack on Ukraine is an act of aggression which is having tragic consequences across the region. BP has operated in Russia for over 30 years, working with brilliant Russian colleagues. However, this military action represents a fundamental change.

"It has led the BP board to conclude, after a thorough process, that our involvement with Rosneft, a state-owned enterprise, simply cannot continue. We can no longer support BP representatives holding a role on the Rosneft board.

"The Rosneft holding is no longer aligned with BP's business and strategy and it is now the board's decision to exit BP's shareholding in Rosneft. The BP board believes these decisions are in the best long-term interests of all our shareholders."

BP chief executive Bernard Looney said he had been "deeply shocked and saddened by the situation in Ukraine".

He added: "It has caused us to fundamentally rethink BP's position with Rosneft. I am convinced that the decisions we have taken as a board are not only the right thing to do, but are also in the long-term interests of BP.

"Our immediate priority is caring for our great people in the region and we will do our utmost to support them. We are also looking at how BP can support the wider humanitarian effort."

The move comes after BP came under pressure from the UK Government to cut ties with Rosneft.

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng held a virtual call with Mr Looney for around 20 minutes on Friday to discuss the company's position.

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: "I welcome BP's decision to exit its shareholding in Rosneft oil company.

"Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine must be a wake-up call for British businesses with commercial interests in Putin's Russia."

Ireland will not contribute financially to weapons for Ukraine, after the EU announced it would close its airspace to Russian airlines, fund weapons purchases to Ukraine and ban some pro-Kremlin media outlets.

The country has a longstanding policy of military neutrality.

A Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson told PA news agency: "The EU Foreign Affairs Council will approve a package of assistance to the Ukrainian armed forces consisting of both lethal and non-lethal military equipment.

"The latter component will include supplies such as personal protective equipment, medical kits and fuel.

"In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, Ireland will constructively abstain from the lethal equipment elements and will not contribute financially to this aspect.

"Instead, we will provide a corresponding contribution to the provision of non-lethal support. Our understanding is that a number of Member States, including Austria and Malta, are likely to take the same approach."

Boris Johnson made a speech at the Ukrainian Cathedral of the Holy Family in Mayfair, London on Sunday evening in which he told the congregation the UK "cannot shut our eyes" to the country's plight following the Russian invasion.

The Prime Minister said: "Thank you very much for welcoming me tonight in this place of faith and hope in what are, for the people of Ukraine, the darkest times in modern memory.

"And I'm glad to be in this beautiful church, this cathedral, because there is a story in the gospel, I'm not a great preacher but I know how to tell you, there's a story in the gospel that teaches us exactly what we must do when our neighbours come under attack.

"And I mean, of course, the story of the man who fell among thieves on the way to Jericho and was left for dead.

"And so the innocent people are subject to a barbaric and unprovoked attack, we in the UK cannot shut our eyes and pass by on the other side and that is why we in the UK are doing everything we can to help economically, politically, diplomatically, militarily."

In his address to the Ukrainian Cathedral of the Holy Family, in Mayfair, London on Sunday, Boris Johnson said the UK was Ukraine's "neighbour" and compared the current crisis to the story of the Good Samaritan in The Bible.

He said: "We are neighbours in the words of the gospel. We are neighbours to Ukraine because Ukrainians are literally our neighbours.

"Hundreds of thousands have come to live and work in this country over the decades, making an immeasurable contribution to British society and that is the reason why we are neighbours. That's one reason.

"And then we are neighbours because we share Ukrainian ideals of freedom and democracy and independence.

"We must not and cannot allow those ideals to be trampled on and crushed on our European continent and we will not - and that is the second reason why we are your neighbours.

"There is a more fundamental point and this is the point that Jesus was actually getting at in that parable of the Good Samaritan, which is that, even if we did not feel those emotional ties as we do, even if we did not have that political bond, the geo-strategic bond between us, it would still be right to help Ukraine in any way that we can."

Boris Johnson told the Ukrainian Cathedral of the Holy Family on Sunday evening that he holds "no hostility" to the Russian people but there is "no possible excuse" for its leadership to choose to invade Ukraine.

He said: "I'm going to stress that there is no hostility in my heart towards the Russian people, none whatever - quite the reverse. My heart aches for the Russian parents who are already losing their children in this vicious and appalling war - just as it aches for the civilians and the people of Ukraine.

"But when it comes to the Russian leadership who chose this path of violence, and I stress chose this path of violence and aggression, there can be no possible excuse.

"And never in all my study or memory of politics and international affairs have I seen so clear a distinction between right and wrong, between good and evil, between light and dark - And that is the real reason why is Ukraine is our neighbour today.

"And by the way, I say to all the countries around the world who have only just been waking up to the horror of what is going on, I say to everyone around the world, that is why Ukraine should be your neighbour, too.

"And though the candle of freedom may burn low in Ukraine in the days, and perhaps the months ahead, I want you to know that we in the UK will stand by Ukraine, stand by you, until that candle blazes bright in independence and in liberty and in sovereign democracy for the people in Ukraine."

Boris Johnson has said he "just couldn't believe" that President Putin would invade Ukraine in the way that he has and has been "amazed by the sheer wonton aggression".

Speaking to a group of Ukrainians at the Cathedral of the Holy Family in Mayfair, London on Sunday evening, the Prime Minister said he had followed the union of Ukraine during his early career as a journalist.

He said: "I had been following the difficulties of those who be campaigning for freedom and independence in Ukraine for a long long time but I never thought it would be a tragedy like this.

"I think many of us have been totally amazed by the sheer wonton aggression by the Putin government.

"We saw all the intelligence, we've seen the building up, we kept warning our allies, we kept warning our friends in Kyiv but I just couldn't believe that it was going to happen in the way that it did.

"I almost really couldn't believe it because I knew Ukraine and I knew that the Ukrainian people love their country and so I just couldn't understand why Putin would embark on that, why he would risk to lose the lives of so many Russians in a war against people whose national feeling was so strong and so passionate."

Britain is to provide a further £40 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine, the Government has announced.

Downing Street said the funding will help aid agencies respond to the deteriorating humanitarian situation, creating access to basic necessities and medical supplies such as medicines, syringes, dressings and wound care packs.

Boris Johnson said: "In the last days the world has witnessed awe-inspiring displays of bravery and heroism from the Ukrainian people in response to those who seek to obliterate their freedom by force.

"The UK will not turn our backs in Ukraine's hour of need. We are providing all the economic and military support we can to help those Ukrainians risking everything to protect their country."

On peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, Mr Johnson said he has doubts President Putin was wanting to negotiate, adding: "There's nothing I've seen so far in his behaviour that leads me to think that he could possibly be sincere."

Boris Johnson criticised broadcaster RT for "peddling" material that is "doing a lot of damage to the truth", adding that Ofcom should look at it to assess whether it is "infringing the rules of this country".

Boris Johnson said "Putin will fail" as he spoke to Ukrainians after a service at the Cathedral of the Holy Family in Mayfair, London, on Sunday night.

The Prime Minister called the invasion a "continuing disaster" but added: "I've got absolutely no doubt in my mind that, in the end and who knows when that will but I hope that will be as soon as possible, I think Putin will fail.

"He will not succeed in crushing Ukraine and we in the UK will do everything in our power to ensure that outcome.

"That is not just because it is right geo-strategically but because we need to stick up for freedom that that is clearly important. Very, very important.

"It's also because what's happening is a totally moral abomination and I think more and more people around the world can see that, and I think the middle ground of the world is moving against Putin - the people who were kind of apathetic before about this, the countries in the UN who maybe thought they didn't need to take a view - I think they will start to move towards Ukraine."

Mr Johnson added that he thinks there is "only one way" Russia's invasion will end and that is with Ukraine's independence.

Asked for his reaction to the prospect of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, Boris Johnson said: "What's happening on the on the European continent is an absolute catastrophe.

"And President Putin has decided to wage a war of choice against the people of Ukraine. He's inflicting untold misery, violence, suffering on a completely innocent population.

"If he wants to stop, if he wants to withdraw, if he wants to negotiate, that's very good news.

"I have my doubts, I've got to tell you. There's nothing I've seen so far in his behaviour that leads me to think that he could possibly be sincere.

"But if he is then we should pursue every avenue, but clearly what needs to happen is he needs to withdraw his war machine from from Ukraine."

Mr Johnson was asked what his message to President Putin is after he said he is putting his nuclear arsenal on alert.

Mr Johnson said: "I think that's a distraction from the reality of what's going on in Ukraine.

"This is an innocent people who are facing a totally unprovoked act of aggression against them, and what's actually happening is that they are fighting back perhaps with more effect, with more resistance, than the Kremlin had bargained for.

"And I think that is what is really going on and you can see some of the logistical difficulties that the Russian forces are experiencing.

"You can see and I think that the Russian Defence Ministry have themselves conceded that they're having casualties. This is a disastrous misbegotten venture by President Putin.

"It can lead to no good whatever for Russia as we in the West have said continuously from the beginning. It needs to end. If he has a proposal to negotiate and withdraw, then all the better."

In response to the Football Association's announcement that England will not play any international fixtures against Russia "for the foreseeable future", Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said: "I welcome this move from @FA. The UK is spearheading a global response to isolate Russia from sporting and cultural events on the world stage.

"Putin must pay the price for his senseless and barbaric aggression against Ukraine."

Boris Johnson was asked if the UK is going to make it easier for Ukrainian refugees to move here and he said: "We want to be as generous as we possibly can, and certainly we want people who have relatives in Ukraine to be able to bring them over as fast as possible.

"We want to make sure that we have routes for people fleeing disaster, war, persecution in Ukraine to come here. And we're setting aside more to help with the humanitarian crisis in the countries bordering Ukraine, putting another £40 million for medical supplies and immediate help.

"We'll also be partnering up with some of the countries in the immediate vicinity of Ukraine to help bring people over.

"Don't forget, the UK, since 2015 has been one of the most generous, if not the most, welcoming country in Europe, and I'm very proud that since I've been Prime Minister actually we've had very large numbers of people from Hong Kong, and a huge welcome for the people from Afghanistan. We will be very generous to the Ukrainians."

Pressed on what he means by "very generous" and asked how many people would be accepted, Mr Johnson said: "Well, we will have a system that lets people come when they're in fear of persecution, when they need to... for family reunion or other purposes.

"Don't forget the UK, is a... I'm a former Mayor of London which is the most diverse city on earth and all the better for it. We thrive and prosper partly as a result of being open to hardworking people from around the world. Ukrainians already contributed a huge amount to our country and to our society."

The Prime Minister has confirmed any Ukrainian person settled in the UK will be able to bring immediate members of their family to join them in Britain.

Downing Street said this will "benefit many thousands of people who at this moment are making desperate choices about their future".

Boris Johnson was asked how soon can he impose sanctions on Russian oligarchs based in the UK and said if a link with the "Putin regime" can be proven, then the Government will be in a position to "distrain those assets, to seize them, to take them".

He added: "I think that when it comes to the rebuilding of Ukraine after this nightmare, this disaster caused entirely by President Putin and his cronies, I can't think of a better use for that cash."

Boris Johnson was asked if the Russian broadcaster RT should be allowed to broadcast in the UK.

He said: "We have a principle in this country that we don't allow politicians to ban this or that media organisation.

"And that's the way we do it. And I think we're better for that.

"But I've got to tell you that I think the stuff that RT is peddling at the moment is doing a lot of damage to the truth, and I think it's important that Ofcom should look at it and make up its mind about whether that organisation is infringing the rules of this country."

When it was put to him that it sounded like he would ban it if he had the power to do so, Mr Johnson said: "Yes but the difference between us and Russia is that the power is not with me, and that's the right thing.

"And that, you know, is partly what we're fighting for."

Boris Johnson has told President Volodymyr Zelensky he will do "all he could" to ensure further military aid reaches Ukrainian forces, Downing Street has said.

The Prime Minister spoke to the Ukrainian president again on Sunday, praising the "heroic" resistance of the Ukrainian people in the face of the Russian attack, accordin to the No 10 readout of the call.

Mr Zelensky said, in turn, that the next 24 hours will be "a crucial period" for his country.

"The Prime Minister lauded the bravery of the Ukrainian people following the Russian invasion and praised the leadership of President Zelensky in the face of such adversity," a No 10 spokesman said. "The resistance of the Ukrainian people was heroic, the Prime Minister added.

"President Zelensky said he believed the next 24 hours was a crucial period for Ukraine, and the Prime Minister said he would do all he could to help ensure defensive aid from the UK and allies reached Ukraine.

"The leaders agreed to continue to stay in close contact and the Prime Minister reiterated the UK's staunch support for Ukraine's sovereignty."

Schallenberg sharply condemns Putin's nuclear weapons threat

Vienna - Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg (conservative People's Party, VP) has sharply condemned the Russian President Vladimir Putin for putting the Russian nuclear forces on high alert. Putin "must know that this path would in truth mean the end", said Schallenberg to the APA on Sunday night.

This was the weapon that "guaranteed mutual destruction"; he said. There was "not the slightest reason" for Moscow to take this step, said Schallenberg.

Putin said that the measure was because of NATO's aggressive behaviour - in his view - and the economic sanctions. The west had taken no steps that could be seen as provocation - "on the contrary, it always said it would not deploy soldiers to Ukraine", said Schallenberg.

Austria always advocated for abolishing nuclear weapons - they must never be used, said the foreign minister. Those who owned these weapons knew that "there was no way back - then we would in fact have a nuclear world war".

On Sunday night, the EU foreign ministers held a virtual meeting to pass a further sanction package against Russia. The measures included excluding some Russian banks from the global payment system SWIFT.

Iran standing firm on logical red lines

TEHRAN — As the talks were resumed on Monday, reports from Vienna indicate that the United States and the European troika (France, Britain, and Germany) are not willing to show real flexibility.

In 2015, Iran, the U.S., the European troika, Russia, and China signed an agreement that promised a great sanction relief for the Islamic Republic. Nevertheless, with the U.S. and the three European countries throwing stones in Iran’s way, the agreement, endorsed by the UN Security Council, failed to benefit Iran economically.

With the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the agreement in May 2018, Iran practically lost the minimum economic privileges it already had. The EU’s inaction added fuel to the fire. It cooperated by bowing to Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran.

Since the beginning of the seventh round of the negotiations in Vienna on November 29, the Western media tried to portray Iran as the party that is reluctant to revive the 2015 nuclear deal. When the Iranian negotiating team presented practical initiatives, the Wall Street Journal and Reuters used every measure to say that Iran’s demands are maximalist, but they failed to provide evidence to their claims.

The Vienna talks have now reached a critical stage. Reports from Vienna indicate that the talks are at a “make or break” point. On November 29, Iran’s top negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani said, “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.” The phrase indicated that Iran is seriously pursuing reviving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) while seriously upholding the rights of the Iranian people.

Iranian officials have repeatedly stated that the negotiating team clearly considers Tehran’s red lines. As negotiation is principally based on a “give and take”, Iran has shown the necessary flexibility needed to revive the internationally agreed deal, but the Western sides are not showing the necessary flexibility.

When it comes to action, the European troika, also called E3, are not even willing to back down from their meager demands. However, they expect Iran to back down from its critical red lines. One thing is now certain.

Even in case, the talks fail, Tehran will not back down from its logical red lines.

Iranian negotiators believe that to finish the job, there are certain decisions that the Western parties need to take first.

The positions of the Iranian negotiating team have been based on clear principles from the beginning, and taking breaks will not change these positions.

The West needs to make drastic political decisions that will definitively shape the future of U.S. involvement in the plan.

Ali Bagheri Kani left Tehran for Vienna on Sunday night.

Before his departure to Vienna on Sunday night, Bagheri Kani participated in a key meeting of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council arranged to take stock of the state of the talks. The council underlined the need to meet Iran’s legal and logical demands which are part of the country’s red lines, according to Nour News, a website close to the Council.

During the meeting, it was underlined that the remaining issues, which have put the negotiations on the verge of “agreement or deadlock,” should be swiftly settled. Accepting any agreement by Iran depends on the settlement of these issues, Nour News reported.

Agreement in Vienna can be reached, if and only if the Westerners are willing to demonstrate “true” flexibility.

Austrian bank to take biggest blow from sanctions]]

Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) could close its entire business in Russia, which accounts for around a third of its revenue with experts saying it is the European bank that will suffer the most from the sanction package against Russia.

Austria’s second-biggest bank has already witnessed dramatic losses, with its value on the stock market halving in the last two weeks. A significant portion of revenue comes from Russia as the bank has invested heavily there since the fall of the Iron Curtain.

This would render RBI the most affected bank in Europe in terms of the percentage of total assets, ahead of UniCredit and Société General, according to Gabriel Felbermayr, head of the Austrian Institute of Economic Research Vienna.

“That’s where a protective umbrella will have to be put in place now so that this doesn’t lead to real problems at RBI,” he told Ö1.

According to Reuters, the bank already has an emergency plan in place and is looking at leaving Russia where it is currently listed as the tenth biggest bank in terms of assets.

However, so far, the bank has denied the existence of such emergency plans. “RBI has no plans to leave Russia,” a spokesperson of RBI told die Presse.

But if the Russian economy were to collapse, the Russian subsidiary of RBI would be under enormous pressure as it has issued loans worth €11.6 billion in Russia but only has €2.4 billion in equity capital.

However, experts say that the company is likely to shift its geographic focus away from Russia due to uncertainties over future business opportunities, making further investments in the region unlikely.

The European Central Bank has already put banks with close ties to Russia – like the RBI – under closer scrutiny.

Sberbank Europe to be closed, subsidiaries sold]]

The European arm of Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, has been closed by order of the European Central Bank (ECB), which had warned it faced failure due to a run on deposits after Russia invaded Ukraine, Austria’s Financial Market Authority (FMA) said.

The European Central Bank’s Single Resolution Board (SRB) Single Resolution Board (SRB) determined earlier this week that Sberbank Europe, which is based in Vienna, was failing or likely to fail due to large withdrawals from clients of the bank. That prompted Austria’s FMA on Monday to impose a moratorium on the bank’s activities.

The FMA’s announcement late on Tuesday (1 March) that it was ordering the bank to close came just over an hour before that moratorium was due to expire.

“By order of the ECB, the Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA) issued a decision today banning the licensed credit institution ‘Sberbank Europe AG’ … from continuing business operations in their entirety with immediate effect,” the FMA said in a statement on Tuesday.

Sberbank Europe likely to fail according to European Central Bank[https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/sberbank-europe-likely-to-fail-according-to-european-central-bank/]

The European Central Bank (ECB) concluded on Monday (28 February) that Sberbank Europe is failing or likely to fail, following considerable withdrawals from the accounts of Sberbank’s European subsidiary over the past week.

According to the SRB, this means that the Austria-based parent of Sberbank Europe AG would enter insolvency procedures while the Croatian and Slovenian subsidiaries of Sberbank Europe would be sold to larger local banks.

The European Union and the United States have responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with a battery of sanctions including moving to ban big Russian banks from SWIFT, the main global payments system.

As a result, Sberbank Europe said on Monday that several of its banks had “experienced a significant outflow of customer deposits within a very short period of time”. This happened even though Sberbank Europe was not directly targeted by the sanctions.

The SRB ordered the moratorium of two days so that it could determine whether the case should be handled under European bank resolution rules and decided it should not, the FMA said. Insolvency procedures will be carried out according to national Austrian law, according to the SRB.

The FMA said it had appointed an administrator who is tasked with determining whether and when the criteria of insolvency are met. In the meantime, the closure triggers Austria’s deposit guarantee scheme, which covers deposits up to €100,000 per customer, the FMA said.

The central banks of Slovenia and Croatia announced that Sberbank’s operations in their countries would be taken over respectively by Slovenia’s biggest banking group NLB and the Croatian Postal Bank (HPB), which is majority owned by the government.

Customers in Croatia and Slovenia will be able to withdraw money as normal from Wednesday after restrictions over the past two days.

Sberbank Europe said in November it had reached a deal to sell its subsidiaries in Croatia, Slovenia, Hungary, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to a group including Serbia’s AIK bank and Slovenia’s Gorenjska bank.

Serbian regulators gave their consent on Monday but Gorenjska said it was no longer viable to proceed with the acquisition of the Slovenian subsidiary.

Sarajevo-based ASA Banka acquired Sberbank Sarajevo, the banking agency of Bosnia’s Bosniak-Croat Federation said late on Tuesday, while the the Serb Republic government acquired Sberbank Banja Luka on Monday.

Main themes on selected current affairs programmes on Austrian TV on 27 February-1 March 2022

The impending start of a parliamentary inquiry into corruption and Austria's stance on the Ukraine conflict were the key topics for commercial broadcaster ATV's political talk show Aktuell Die Woche, aired on 27 February at 2120 gmt. Public broadcaster ORF's political talk show Im Zentrum on 27 February at 2114 gmt discussed sanctions against Russia and the potential effect of the Ukraine conflict on Austrian society. Commercial broadcaster Oe24's political talk show Fellner! Live on 1 March at 2000 gmt interviewed Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner about the Ukraine conflict and its significance for the Austrian armed forces.

Neutral Austria supports sanctions

"I believe that the statement we just heard from the Chancellor [Karl Nehammer] was right. It was right to emphasise on the one hand that being militarily neutral does not mean that you cannot or should not very clearly stand up against the aggressor, which is what Russia is, what Vladimir Putin is," said political consultant Thomas Hofer, speaking on political talk show Aktuell Die Woche on 27 February.

Hofer was discussing the Austrian government's announcements supporting the EU sanctions against Russia and explaining that Austria's stance does not conflict with its status as a militarily neutral country.

Aktuell Die Woche then noted that New Austria (NEOS) leader Beate Meinl-Reisinger had called for Austria to completely review its long-standing policy of neutrality in the face of the Ukraine crisis, and that Meinl-Reisinger also noted that Austria's neutrality had already become a relative concept after Austria had joined various EU defence policy initiatives as a non-Nato country.

Asked how the Austrian population views the neutrality policy, opinion pollster Peter Hajek said: "That is not up for discussion, and it is very important because the Austrian population has stuck with neutrality for a long time. We have surveyed this for decades, and it was basically always the case that 75% of the population, a strong three quarters, have strongly supported neutrality."

Hofer noted that in the short term, political leaders across Europe "will see an increase" in their approval ratings "because in such a crisis situation there will be a kind of rally-around-the-flag effect".

Tricky connections

Aktuell Die Woche then noted that the Ukraine crisis highlights potentially problematic connections between various Austrian political parties and Russian state or private entities, as well as several former Austrian political leaders working for key Russian enterprises.

Hofer said: "All across the spectrum, it is simply the case that in the past, and basically continuing into the present, we have constantly had a problem, at various political levels. Whether it is the KPOe [Austrian Communist Party] in Graz, the FPOe [Austrian People's Party] with its treaty with Putin's party, but also former politicians from the big parties, even if they are not that big anymore, you certainly saw what the Austrian way can be like, so to speak. And that is not necessarily supposed to be taken as positive."

Regarding former Austrian leaders working for Russian companies, Hofer said: "A few people have pulled the ripcord in that regard, such as the former chancellor Christian Kern, rightly so, that was the right move. Others did not do that. They must settle that for themselves. But there were always signals. You can be surprised by the massiveness of Russia's intervention, but less so when it comes to Mr Putin's character and his fundamental tenets."

About Austria's general economic ties with Russia, Hofer said: "We are not economic experts, but it is clear that Austria was and remains strongly invested there, no doubt about that. This is also not easy in terms of gas supplies, so [there is] a very high dependency, even higher than in Germany, where it is relatively strongly present already. So that should not be taken lightly."

Doctored surveys scandal

The discussion then turned to reports about a full confession by opinion pollster Sabine B, alleging that Austrian People's Party (OeVP) figures had commissioned doctored opinion survey results from her in past years, designed to embellish Sebastian Kurz's image while he was still chancellor. B's confession further alleges that the Social Democratic Party (SPOe), also commissioned doctored polls in 2013. B is expected to remain a major witness in a larger set of investigations into alleged instances of corruption within the OeVP.

Hajek said: "It is remarkable that the opinion pollster made a very broad deposition, and when it comes to the crown witness arrangement, I know that you must be able to say significantly more or give the investigating authorities significantly more information."

"Whether Sebastian Kurz is exonerated or not, I believe that is simply for the public prosecutors and then possibly the courts," Hajek continued.

Asked whether the allegations against the SPOe could become a problem for SPOe leader Pamela Rendi-Wagner, Hofer said: "Not for her personally, because she was demonstrably not even a member of the party back then."

Hofer noted that the OeVP might use the allegations against the SPOe as a defence strategy in the upcoming public inquiry about corruption allegations against the OeVP: "But what you are now seeing, though I am not constructing a causal chain here, is that if there is such a comprehensive confession [from Sabine B], and I cannot determine the degree of truthfulness, it can play a part in the OeVP's strategy, including when it comes to the parliamentary inquiry due to start next week"

Current polls

Hajek then showed current voting intentions per party as follows:

Social Democratic Party (SPOe) 25%

Austrian People's Party (OeVP) 23%

Austrian Freedom Party (FPOe) 20%

Greens 11%

New Austria (NEOS) 11%

People, Freedom, Fundamental Rights (MFG) 7%

Speaking about the close proximity of SPOe and OeVP, Hajek said that "the informed viewer knows that this difference of two percentage points is not significant". Hajek also said that "there are also polls that see the SPOe at 26%-27%, so it could be that there is a trend looming here".

"And you also see that the FPOe has increasingly moved up. So, we are back in a situation we were in in 1999 and in the 2010s, which is that there are three medium-sized parties that are relatively close to one another," Hajek concluded.

Russian invasion of Ukraine

"This war also shows how strong the Ukrainian population has showed itself to be when standing up for freedom, for democracy, to fight for our future. And I would like to say here as the Ukrainian ambassador that I am proud, very proud, to have a president like that. I am proud of all Ukrainians, and I am proud of Ukraine's armed forces, who are fighting heroically, defending us, but not just Ukraine, but also Europe, Europe's future," said Vasyl Khymynets, Ukrainian ambassador to Austria, speaking on political talk show Im Zentrum on 27 February.

Khymynets was discussing Ukraine's efforts to counter the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Im Zentrum then broached the topic of Russia's nuclear threat against Europe, based on 6,255 warheads.

Asked what Russia might intend to achieve with the threat, Harald Kujat, former president of the Nato committee in Brussels, said: "Well, if you observed Putin, his body language and the way he spoke, and also the faces of these two generals, then you will have taken note that what he said is not a sign of strength but a sign of weakness. He is in a difficult situation and is trying to make the best of it from his perspective." Kujat added, "And Putin also knows that whoever deploys a nuclear weapon first, dies second."

Former Austrian president Heinz Fischer (SPOe) said: "I also believe that this is a sign of weakness, that he has reached the end of his Latin. I also believe that today's Putin is a different one compared to Putin the way he was when he first came into office."

Fischer added, "And I believe he now has the opinion that the course of history is forcing him to take such steps and he will make a mistake in doing so, and he will go down into history as the person to cause the first big war in Europe, going beyond civil wars."

Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner (OeVP) said: "This is certainly a turning point. The situation is undoubtedly serious." She added, "What we have to do in any case is draw the right conclusions. That applies to Europe, when it comes to the security architecture, and when it comes to the military budget, especially in Austria. And naturally, to use every possibility to get back on the diplomatic path."

Sanctions

Georg Knill, chairman of the Federation of Austrian Industries (IV), said: "We as the industrial sector are very much prepared to pull along with the Austrian federal government's decisions, the decisions at the European level, knowing that it will cause my company pains, financial and economic. But this is about something bigger."

Possibly referring to Fischer's welcoming of Putin for a state visit to Vienna in 2014, NEOS leader Beate Meinl-Reisinger said: "The US intelligence services were very transparent, so I actually do not understand why eyes were closed for so many months, perhaps even Mr president [Heinz Fischer], eyes were closed for so long regarding all the things Putin intends as an autocrat."

"It must certainly be said that with the sanctions that have now been decided, one of Putin's calculations is not working out, namely that of Europe's lacking unity," Meinl-Reisinger further said. "What has now been decided is really a total, really comprehensive economic war. On the one hand, this is about SWIFT, which is a very tough measure," Meinl-Reisinger added.

"The third measure that would have been tough and might happen as a sanction for the Russian side, is to say from the European side that we are now not going to draw any gas anymore," Meinl-Reisinger continued.

Khymynets responded: "Ukrainians are now being killed using the profits from the gas."

Meinl-Reisinger said: "Yes, I know, I totally agree with you. So, this naivety in this area as well, with people in Austria saying for many years that they have no problem with being dependent on Russian gas, and thereby not sufficiently ensuring the national defence in the economic sense."

Meinl-Reisinger further argued that the sanctions are justified despite their price for Western European societies, including Austria: "But the way the financial markets are going to respond tomorrow will also hit us and hurt us. Christian Lindner said it this morning at the Bundestag, and I can only repeat it: That is the price of freedom."

Gas deliveries

Speaking about the potential damage Western sanctions or Russian countersanctions might cause to the Austrian economy, Knill said that if further escalations were to result in "complete sanctions" stopping Austrian exports to Ukraine and Russia, "the overall economic damage would be 0.45% of GDP". Knill noted that the effect could therefore be considered "manageable" but that "it would very strongly hit individual companies in Austria".

However, Knill also noted that a potential Russian decision to cut off gas supplies to Europe would be highly problematic: "There is a significantly more dangerous, riskier, and still entirely unclear situation in connection with SWIFT tomorrow, which is the question of what happens with the Russian gas deliveries to Europe."

"We are currently still in the fortunate situation that Russia is meeting its obligations of gas deliveries", Knill further noted, adding that "40% of all gas imports comes from Russia, and we cannot switch that off overnight". Knill also said that "Austrian industry needs 40% of all gas consumption in Austria to keep up the production, employment and prosperity in this country".

Knill said that Austria could last "about five weeks" if Russia were to cut off all supplies overnight.

Tanner said: "I believe that what we see is that the situation is undoubtedly serious. But on the other hand, nobody needs to worry at the current time, because the projections last until the end of March, or if it should actually remain a mild winter, up to the end of April."

Austrian neutrality or complicity?

Khymynets registered his disappointment that European leaders had not taken a tougher stance on Russia following the 2014 annexation of Crimea: "Our problem is: Why Europe did not immediately reject that? Why [is it that] the decision-makers here in Europe have looked away so much from what is happening in Europe, why [have] they courted Putin so much?"

Fischer, referring in part to friendlier Russian-European relations in Putin's early years, said: "I would not use the word 'courted'. From the Austrian perspective, the state treaty was a big event. And this was possible through the cooperation of the USA, Soviet Union, France and England. From the Austrian perspective, the visits by Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders were important, just like they also made visits to France, Germany, and Sweden. And precisely with Putin it was the case, as I pointed out, that he was initially considered to be a reformer, a power for reform."

Meinl-Reisinger noted that she found the "talk about neutrality" to be "somewhat disconcerting" in the face of the Ukraine crisis.

Fischer replied that "neutrality for me is not talk, instead, to me, neutrality is part of the constitution on which I took my oath at the time, and on which you also took an oath, and we must take this part of our constitution seriously".

Meinl-Reisinger noted that "you know as well, of course, that Austria fully and unreservedly joined the European security and defence policy, and this has naturally changed in that regard", and that there was reason to question whether Austria's neutrality "is not a little bit of a pretext sometimes for not having to get involved".

Meinl-Reisinger also noted that a report from 2019 "already proved how financial streams of right-wing parties are flowing from Russia" and that furthermore, "Russian propaganda was deployed for the systematic destabilisation of Europe.

"So, I certainly have the feeling that it is urgently necessary to talk turkey for a change, [and consider] that this is about the most central Austrian interests, and above all our concept of freedom, democracy and human rights."

A European army?

Meinl-Reisinger said that the Ukraine crisis had pointed out the need for a complete overhaul of the European defence infrastructure: "I also believe it is high time that Europe asks itself the question of how we can have a sovereign, independent, and joint foreign policy, speaking with one voice, but not just speaking, acting with a fist, so to speak, put on track security and defence policy, and certainly also independently from Nato, because I have always held the opinion that Europe must take on its own issues at the end of the day."

Meinl-Reisinger added that that would need to involve the creation of "an EU army".

Asked whether she supported the creation of an EU military force, Tanner said: "Well, of course it is beyond doubt that after this turning point, Europe's security architecture must change as well. But I can of course use the term European army, or EU army, and then look at what this means. Does it mean that all 27 member states will dissolve their militaries, or insert them into a European army? So, I believe we must discuss this terminology at some point. But what is beyond doubt is that we must make progress in the context of the joint security and defence policy.

"Nobody will mean that we should therefore dissolve our military and add it into there. Other states certainly also do not want that," Tanner said, adding that EU military units or battle groups were an option instead.

Austrian support for Ukraine

"As you know, after Putin's terrible attack on Ukraine on 24 February, we immediately sent a crisis intervention team into Ukraine, which continues to be present on the ground. It consists of Foreign Ministry employees, special trained experts, people from COBRA [special forces police unit], experts from our special operations group [Jagdkommando] and further servicemen who are in a supporting role in every respect, especially for the embassy staff, for all the Austrians, which are about 120, according to the Foreign Ministry's latest information," said Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner, speaking on political talk show Fellner! Live on 1 March.

Tanner had been asked what Austria was doing to support Ukraine in its self-defence against Russia. Tanner noted that in addition to the team, there were "trucks that are en route with medical supplies". Furthermore, Austria had approved "10,000 helmets for the protection of the civilian population".

Tanner emphasised that all Austrian aid fell within the domain of "non-lethal weapons, everything that is possible for us as a neutral state".

Asked whether Austria might decide to supply lethal aid, Tanner said: "No, that is not possible at all. We are banned from doing that based on the War Materials Act [KMG] and our legislative and constitutional regulations in connection with neutrality."

Change of Austria's military outlook

The discussion then turned to how the Ukrainian crisis is reshaping Austria's military and strategic priorities. Tanner noted that European leaders "must become faster in our deliberations" about joint security policy "so that we become a more credible actor as Europe".

Asked if Austria will follow Germany in boosting its defence budget given the Ukraine crisis, Tanner said: "For defence budgets, not just in Germany, this means that necessities have been recognised. As Franz Vranitzky [former chancellor, SPOe] recently said in an interview, it was also the case for Austria that we put much more of a premium on social security in past years and decades than on military security, because we felt safe, perhaps too safe in that domain.

"Speaking now for Austria, I said since coming into office - and not just said, we have achieved a great many things, we have a triple rise for the regular defence budget, to the highest-ever level at 2.73 billion euros and a few special investment packages - that years and decades of shortages must be caught up, and this applies even more now. And this undoubtedly requires additional money."

Tanner also drew attention to the "mental defence of the country". "After all, if you look at the resilience of the Ukrainian population and look at the numbers about the extent to which Austrians would be willing to defend their country with military force, we have a lot of catching up to do precisely in the area of mental national defence," Tanner added.

1ST LEAD Oil alliance OPEC+ continues moderate policy undeterred by war By Albert Otti, dpa

Vienna (dpa) - The oil alliance OPEC+, dominated by Saudi Arabia and Russia, is sticking to its cautious production increases despite the war in Ukraine.

In April, the 20 countries plan to expand their daily output by 400,000 barrels as planned, the group announced after a brief online meeting on Wednesday. One barrel contains 159 litres.

On Wednesday, Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the two main crude oil grades, again marked multi-year highs of up to $111.72 and $110.14 respectively.

The price surge on the crude oil market was triggered by Russia's attack on Ukraine and the consequences for oil supplies.

On the one hand, experts consider it possible that major economies will sanction the import of Russian oil, on the other hand, counter-sanctions by Russia up to and including an export ban are also considered possible. Russia is one of the largest oil exporters in the world.

The OPEC+ communiqué did not directly address the Russian military action in Ukraine. From the alliance's point of view, the current price movements were not due to a change in demand or supply but were caused by "current geopolitical developments."

Saudi Arabia, one of the world's largest oil producers, sent no signals that it would pump its own oil into the market to compensate for the shortfall in the event of a Russian supply cut.

Additional oil, on the other hand, could flow from Iran in the foreseeable future if the negotiations to restore the 2015 nuclear pact are concluded in Vienna in the next few days as hoped. Then not only would Tehran have to restrict its nuclear programme again, but Washington would also have to lift the US embargo on Iranian oil. In the wake of these sanctions, Iran's daily production has fallen by 1.3 million barrels.

OPEC+ consists of the Vienna-based Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a group of countries led by Russia, which agree on their production targets and thus influence supply and prices.

EU Foreign Ministers to Discuss New Sanctions Against Russia on Friday - Vienna

VIENNA, March 2 (Sputnik) – The foreign ministers of EU member states will discuss a new round of sanctions against Russia in the wake of its military operation in Ukraine on March 4, Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said on Wednesday.

“We are working on the fourth package [of sanctions]. On Friday, I will have a new extraordinary meeting of [EU] foreign ministers with the participation of US [Secretary of State Anthony] Blinken,” Schallenberg told a press conference​​​.

The European Union has put “all its financial and economic power” in action, and its efforts have effects, the minister said.

“The exchange is closed, the ruble is suffering large-scale losses, Russian enterprises are being destroyed,” he said.

Western nations have introduced fresh sanctions against Moscow since last week when Russia began a military operation in Ukraine in response to requests for help from the Donbas republics in the wake of attacks by the Ukrainian military. The sanction packages target some Russian banks, officials, and include closures of airspace for Russian planes, among other measures.

Ukraine request the postponement of this month’s World Cup play-off semi-final against Scotland

Ukraine have requested the postponement of this month’s World Cup play-off semi-final against Scotland in Glasgow.

The single-leg match is due to take place at Hampden on March 24, with the winners travelling to face Wales or Austria five days later to contest a place at the finals in Qatar later in the year.

But with the Ukraine squad being heavily dependent on home-grown players, the domestic league having been suspended until further notice and the country’s airspace having been closed following the Russian invasion, a formal request has been lodged with Uefa and Fifa to delay the game.

Some seven members of the Ukraine starting team from the 2-0 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina last November which earned them their play-off place play for either Dynamo Kyiv or Shakhtar Donetsk in their homeland. Fifteen of the 23-man squad for that game are based in Ukraine.

Several national team players have already signed up for the military, while all males aged between 18-60 are banned from leaving the country which is under martial law.

Although the draw for the World Cup group stage is due to take place on April 1, there is a good chance that the play-off semi-finals and finals could be moved to the June window which is currently given over to Nations League fixtures. Scotland are due to play Armenia, Ireland and, ironically, Ukraine, but the World Cup matches would take precedence.

The Scottish FA has so far declined to comment on Ukraine’s request for a postponement, but offered support and training facilities in a statement issued earlier this week. “The Scottish FA President, Rod Petrie, has written to his counterpart at the Ukrainian Association of Football to send a message of support, friendship and unity,” the statement said. “Football is inconsequential amid conflict, but we have conveyed the strong sense of solidarity communicated to us by Scotland fans and citizens in recent days.

“We remain in dialogue with Uefa and Fifa regarding our men’s Fifa World Cup Play-off and women’s World Cup qualifier and have offered to support our Ukrainian colleagues’ preparations as best we can in these unimaginably difficult circumstances.

“Should the current circumstances continue, we will not sanction the nomination of a team to participate in our scheduled UEFA Regions Cup fixture against Russia, due to be played in August.”

Speaking earlier this week, Ukraine manager Oleksandr Petrakov said: “I have spoken to several members of the national team who are still in the country. I would prefer not to say where they are at the moment.

“I have also spoken to Andriy Yarmolenko at West Ham and Oleksandr Zinchenko at Manchester City. All these guys are as shocked as I am.

“I was in Turkey with the domestic clubs at their pre-season training camps and they told me there that Russia would invade us, but I didn’t believe it.”

IN DOUBT Ukraine request Scotland World Cup play-off match is POSTPONED until June due to Russian invasion

UKRAINE have asked Fifa to postpone the upcoming World Cup play-off against Scotland until June.

Steve Clarke’s men are set to host the Ukrainians this month for a chance to face either Wales or Austria.

The winner of that tie will then claim a coveted World Cup spot in Qatar later this year.

The game has been in some doubt due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine last week.

Now the clash has been thrown into turmoil, as Reuters claim the Ukrainians have asked Uefa and Fifa to postpone the March 24 showdown.

It is an understandable plea from a country who has suffered the most unthinkable attacks in the past week and Fifa is likely to grant the request – which will also mean Wales’ match with Austria being postponed.

World chiefs also appear to be about to change their mind about awarding Poland a walkover to a play-off final against Sweden or Czech Republic after booting Russia out of the competition.

Slovakia, Norway or Hungary will all be potential beneficiaries with the Slovaks., who were third in their group behind Croatia and Russia, the most likely choice

Ukraine boss Oleksandr Petrakov revealed talks were underway with his domestic stars about the possibility of traveling to face Scotland.

The 64-year-old said: “I have spoken to several members of the national team who are still in the country. I would prefer not to say where they are at the moment.

“I have also spoken to Andriy Yarmolenko at West Ham and Oleksandr Zinchenko at Manchester City. All these guys are as shocked as I am.

“I was in Turkey with the domestic clubs at their pre-season training camps and they told me there that Russia would invade us, but I didn’t believe it.”

Scotland voiced their support for Ukraine when announcing they will refuse to play against Russia at ANY level.

An SFA-sanctioned amateur national team were initially due to face off a Russian side at this summer’s Uefa Regions Cup.

BUMPED UP Rangers and Celtic could get GUARANTEED Champions League spot and one less qualifying round due to Russia Uefa ban

A statement read: “The Scottish FA President, Rod Petrie, has written to his counterpart at the Ukrainian Association of Football to send a message of support, friendship and unity.

“Football is inconsequential amid conflict, but we have conveyed the strong sense of solidarity communicated to us by Scotland fans and citizens in recent days.

“We remain in dialogue with UEFA and FIFA regarding our men’s FIFA World Cup Play-off and women’s World Cup qualifier and have offered to support our Ukrainian colleagues’ preparations as best we can in these unimaginably difficult circumstances.

“Should the current circumstances continue, we will not sanction the nomination of a team to participate in our scheduled UEFA Regions Cup fixture against Russia, due to be played in August.

“This will remain our position should any other fixtures arise at any level of international football.”

President Volodymyr Zelensky declared a state of emergency lasting 30 days last week.

That gives authorities the right to ban mass gatherings and sporting events.

OMV no longer pursues investments in Russia

OMV no longer pursues investments in Russia

* Russia will no longer be a core region

* Strategic options for Yuzhno Russkoye to be assessed including possibilities to divest or exit

* Achimov interest in West Siberian gas field Urengoy will no longer be pursued

* Value adjustments for Yuzhno Russkoye and for receivables from Nord Stream 2 AG

* Total value adjustment of EUR 1.5 bn - EUR 1.8 bn anticipated

"The war in Ukraine is a tragic and perilous situation that is causing great suffering for many and that we view with the utmost consternation. Our deepest sympathies go out to all of the direct and indirect victims of Russia's military action. We call for the end of all hostilities. It is only in peace that there can be freedom and wellbeing", said Alfred Stern, Chairman of the Executive Board and CEO of OMV.

In light of the latest developments, OMV is reevaluating its engagement in Russia. While Russia has been one of the core regions in OMV's Exploration & Production portfolio, the Executive Board has taken the decision not to pursue any future investments in Russia. Furthermore, a strategic review of its 24.99% interest in Yuzhno Russkoye will be initiated. This review comprises all options including possibilities to divest or exit. As a consequence, OMV expects value adjustment of EUR 0.5 - 0.8 bn (as of December 31, 2021). This non-cash value adjustment will impact the reported Operating Result in the first quarter of the current financial year. With this, OMV reduces its net asset value in Russia (remaining Yuzhno Russkoye value) to around 2% of OMV's total fixed assets and at-equity participation value.

OMV has already ended all negotiations with Gazprom about the potential purchase of a 24.98% stake in blocks 4A/5A of the Achimov-Formation in the Urengoy gas and condensate field and the Basic Sale Agreement from October 3, 2018 has been cancelled.

In addition, OMV will recognize a value adjustment charge of EUR 987 mn (loan plus accrued interest as of December 31, 2021) due to the fact that receivables from Nord Stream 2 AG may be unrecoverable. This is a non-cash value adjustment that will impact reported Earnings before Taxes in the first quarter of the current financial year.

OMV takes its responsibility to supply Europe and Austria with natural gas seriously. Households, institutions, and the industrial sector rely on dependable gas supplies, including gas from Russia which is supplied under longstanding contracts. OMV is working to identify and develop additional sources of supply.

OMV will ensure compliance with all applicable sanction regulations and legal provisions at any moment.

Background information:

OMV Aktiengesellschaft

Nehammer and Dendias reserved on EU energy embargo

Vienna/Kiev/Moscow - Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg (conservative People's Party, VP) and his Greek counterpart Niko Dendias, have been reserved about ideas on an EU oil and gas embargo against Russia. The situation in the US was "quite different" than in Europe, Schallenberg said after Dendias visited Vienna on Tuesday.

Europe was not just a neighbour, "we are also partially dependent" on Russian energy, he said.

Schallenberg pointed out that there were already embargoes against Russia in private industry. But one also had to be realistic. "Austria cannot rule anything out", the same as one had not ruled out a Swift exclusion of Russia. "We have not yet reached the end of the flagpole", said Schallenberg, referring to the EU sanctions against Russia. A fourth sanction package was currently underway.

Dendias said that Greece relied on Russia for 30 percent of its energy. He wanted the European Council to confer before the EU issued a joint response.

Europe needed to diversify its energy providers "so that we have a choice in the future", he said.

Dendias also met with Social Democrat (SP) head Pamela Rendi-Wagner to discuss current developments in Ukraine. Other topics of discussion included the effects of the war on energy supply security in Austria and Greece. They also discussed the Mediterranean and the West Balkan situations.

Dendias was still due to meet with the OSCE secretary general Helga Schmid to discuss the war in Ukraine and the situation in the eastern Mediterranean. According to the Greek side, the foreign minister was also expected to speak with the head of the Austrian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe , Reinhold Lopatka.

EU summit chaos: Five furious nations tear up VDL's Putin plan: 'We won't pay the price!'

EU leaders are locked in a furious bust-up over energy as five members, including Germany, Austria and Hungary, tore up Ursula von der Leyen's plan to cut energy ties with Russia.

Finland and Bulgaria also opposed measures put forward by the European Commission. At a summit in Versailles, the bloc acknowledged the “tectonic shift in European history” caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and vowed to “strengthen our bonds and deepen our partnership” with Kyiv. But they could not see eye-to-eye on a new energy strategy that was published on Tuesday.

It detailed how the bloc can slash its dependence on gas by up to two-thirds in 2022, and completely rid itself of Russian supplies by the end of the decade.

But the bloc currently relies on Russia for 40 percent of its gas, some nations fear they will not be able to cope without Russian imports.

More than 25 percent of the EU's oil imports and 46 percent of its coal imports are also supplied by Russia.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz appeared to hold one of the strongest stances against the plan, given that Germany received 55 percent of its gas from Russia, roughly 140 billion cubic meters in 2021.

Germany also imports 35 percent of its crude oil and 50 percent of its coal from Russia.

Even before the new energy strategy was published, Mr Scholz admitted that Germany would not be able to cope without Russian gas.

The country is still staunchly opposing any sanctions on Russian energy.

Vice-chancellor Robert Habeck warned this would pose a threat to “social peace” in the country and create a “real danger of energy undersupply in certain sectors”.

Instead, Mr Scholz made the case for more specifically targeted sanctions to pressure Russia and to avoid the impact it would have on EU citizens.

But Germany is not the only country that is unwilling to part ways with Russia.

Hungary was unconvinced by the EU plot, with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán saying would oppose energy sanctions at the EU level.

Mr Orbán said on Tuesday after the strategy was published: "While we condemn Russia’s armed offensive and we also condemn the war, we will not allow Hungarian families to be made to pay the price.”

Austria was also staunchly opposed to the plan to sanction Russian energy, perhaps unsurprisingly as 80 percent of its gas is supplied by Russia.

Bulgaria, which gets 70 percent of its from Russia, is also worried about the impacts of energy sanctions on Russia, while Finland too appears unprepared to slash ties.

But internal division within the bloc was laid bare as other countries like Lativa, Poland and Lithuania urged that harsh sanctions on Russian energy should be slapped down immediately.

Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karin said: "I am convinced that we should make a decision to stop energy imports from Russia to get Putin to the negotiating table and end this war."

Poland has also appeared to be one of the biggest advocates of the strategy, arguing that the urgent need to stop Putin is worth the potential economic damage it may cause to the bloc.

A Polish diplomat said: "Billions are flowing to Russia via Nord Stream 1.

“These are billions for which today Ukrainians are paying with their own blood.”

Nord Stream 1 is a major pipeline linking Russia to Germany.

France has also said it is ready to impose energy sanctions on Russia.

Trade minister Franck Riester said: “France is ready to take additional decisions to put pressure on Russia if necessary”.

“We are not closing any doors, we simply have to look at what is effective in putting pressure on Russia and also taking into account the consequences that this may have on the EU and its various members.”

TEHRAN, Mar. 11 (MNA) – Stating that the remaining issues in the Vienna talks are small but difficult, US State Department Spokesman claimed that Washington urges all parties, including Russia, to focus on resolving the final remaining issues.

Speaking in his weekly press conference, US Department of State spokesperson Ned Price answered some questions about the latest update over the sanction removal talks resumed on January 3 between Iran and the P4+1 group in Vienna.

"When it comes to Iran and negotiations in Vienna, you’ve heard us say that there has been significant progress. We remain close to a possible deal", he said.

"It’s really down to a very small number of outstanding issues. But the reason these particular issues are outstanding is that they are among the most difficult ones. I’m reminded of a former president who had a sign on his desk saying, “Hard things are hard.” These are hard issues, and they’re outstanding for that reason", he added.

Without referring to US hesitation and delay in reaching an agreement in sanctions removal talks, he also said, "Now is the time for all parties to show seriousness. We continue to believe that we can and should be able to reach a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA in the coming days."

"But there is little time that remains because of the advancements that we’ve seen over the course of recent months and over the course of the past couple of years in Tehran’s nuclear program", Ned Price claimed.

"We’ve urged all parties – and of course, that includes the Russian Federation – to focus on resolving the final remaining issues so that we can achieve our shared objective", he also claimed.

The eighth round of nuclear talks on the removal of anti-Iranian sanctions kicked off in Austrian capital of Vienna on Monday Dec. 27, 2021 and participants have been completing the drafting text of agreement and deciding on some of the disputed issues.

A source close to the Iranian negotiating team told Iranian media that at least three key issues are remaining in the Vienna talks.

Seizure of Iran’s oil cargo amid Vienna talks may jeopardize agreement

TEHRAN— In an unconstructive move that could jeopardize a possible revival of the 2015 nuclear deal, the United States has discreetly confiscated the cargo of two oil tankers belonging to Iran.

The U.S. claims that the tankers were suspected of smuggling Iranian oil as part of a sophisticated sanctions-busting plot including faked documentation and repainting a ship's deck to conceal unlawful transfers.

Details of the seizure, which had not previously been publicized, were revealed in a federal civil action unsealed last month after the Greek-managed vessels discharged their lucrative cargo, valued up to $38 million, at the behest of U.S. law enforcement in Houston and the Bahamas.

The seizure came as the Biden cabinet works to resurrect the nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran. The revival of the deal is intended to lift illegal sanctions imposed against Iran in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 2231.

This task has been made more important by Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and the U.S. plan to retaliate by prohibiting all Russian oil imports, which may remove more than 10 million barrels of oil per day from the market.

Iran, which pumped an average of 2.4 million barrels per day in 2021 but has been able to sell less than half of what it produces due to sanctions, might make up some of that lost supply.

The foes of Iran caution that, even as Ukraine challenges geopolitical calculations and the United States shifts its focus to Russia, the Biden administration should not ease pressure on the sanction-hit country.

“This seizure exemplifies why the U.S. should not ease sanctions,” said Claire Jungman, chief of staff of the New York-based group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which carefully monitors Iran's crude imports.

“We must continue to fight to ensure that earnings from the sale of Iranian oil are not used to fund terrorism and other actions that endanger the safety and security of all Americans,” she added.

In a long and full of baseless allegations, the Associated Press, which first reported the seizure said, “The long journey that led to the U.S. seizure began in the fall of 2020, when the M/T Stark I, an Iranian-owned vessel subject to U.S. sanctions since 2018, repainted its deck in an apparent attempt to conceal the vessel and evade identification by satellite photography. On October 31, 2020, it arrived at a port in Iran’s Khark Island and loaded full of oil.”

“On Nov. 3, 2020, 733,876 barrels of oil were transported at sea to a different ship, the M/T Arina. Both ships turned off their transponders — a mandated safety equipment on all large ships — during the perilous ship-to-ship transfer to avoid being picked up on ship tracking databases, satellite pictures, and data given by Jungman claim,” it added.

The media seem to have forgotten that the U.S. has a long history of looting Iranian oil.

According to the leaked documents, Donald Trump ordered the seizure of oil tankers carrying Iranian oil off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.

The U.S. also sold the two million barrels of the stolen oil despite the fact that Iran was cash-strapped resulting from Washington’s heavy illegal sanctions.

Of course, this is not a first for the big looters. On July 2, 2020, a seizure order for the cargo from four vessels was issued by U.S. District Court Judge Jeb Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The statement said, “The government announced today that it has successfully executed the seizure order and confiscated the cargo from all four vessels, totaling approximately 1.116 million barrels of petroleum. With the assistance of foreign partners, this seized property is now in U.S. custody.”

The United States has stolen $110 million, put it into a bank account and freezing Iran’s access to it.

Both Iran and Venezuela were and continue to be in need of cash and raw materials to sustain their economies and remain afloat during the devastating COVID-19 outbreaks, which is why Iran dispatched five ships packed with oil to Venezuela in May of last year, bravely breaking past a U.S. blockade. This particular instance demonstrated how critical these trade networks are, which the U.S. considers "clandestine" but are, in fact, conventional trading contacts between sovereign states.

Iran’s then Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif referred to the seizure of Iranian oil tankers as “piracy,” tweeting, “In ‘black is white’ world, UN deprived Iran of its voting rights in the #UNGA as we’re in arrears. Not considered: US #EconomicTerrorism prevents Iran paying for FOOD, let alone UN dues

My letter to @antonioguterres: ps: UN can also collect from $110M US stole in recent piracy.”

However, the AP continues its unfounded claims against Iran, reporting, “Despite U.S. sanctions, Iran has received a monetary bonanza as oil prices have climbed in the last year. Hundreds of privately owned, foreign-flagged tankers — termed a ‘ghost armada’ by Jungman's group — play a key role in the smuggling operation, employing a range of sophisticated ways to conceal their movements.

Even U.S.-owned tankers, such as one controlled by a unit of private equity behemoth Oaktree Capital Management, have been linked to the brisk black market activity. Ship tracking technology has aided efforts to uncover sanctions-evading activity by Iran and Venezuela, whose oil industry is also subject to U.S. export restrictions. Seizing oil supplies, on the other hand, is unusual: prior to this latest operation, it had only happened twice!”

It even went on to claim that “proceeds from the sale of forfeited cargoes are used to recompense American terrorist victims!”

There is a big question why should the revenue from Iran’s looted oil go to U.S. “terrorist victims”. Has the U.S. forgotten that Iran was and remains the biggest force against terrorism in West Asia?

Iran regained the authority to sell oil openly on the international market following the 2015 nuclear deal. However, in 2018, then-President Donald Trump unilaterally exited the agreement and re-imposed American sanctions. This effectively shut down much of Iran's lucrative oil trade, which is a major source of revenue for the country.

However, in recent months, Iranian officials have said that they have been able to sell crude oil despite American sanctions. According to the state-run Iran daily, the Central Bank of Iran provided numbers at the beginning of February indicating that it made $18.6 billion in oil sales in the first half of current Persian year (March 2021-March 2022), up from $8.5 billion in the same period previous year.

In the midst of difficult negotiations to make up for Trump’s idiocy, the Biden administration’s unconstructive move has raised doubts about the United States’ goodwill in the talks.

Seyyed Mohammad Marandi, a media advisor to the Iranian negotiating team in Vienna tweeted on Thursday, “Is this US goodwill? Is this how they want to conclude a deal?”

According to the media advisor, the hijacking of two Iranian oil cargo ships as well as U.S. “intransigence regarding the removal of maximum pressure sanctions and ‘terrorist’ designations for the armed forces is because Biden is weak and vulnerable.”

“Other issues have solutions,” he added on Twitter.

“U.S. piracy and the confiscation of 2 ships with Iranian oil cargo, remaining ‘terrorist’ designations, new U.S. demands as well as the U.S. failure to remove more companies, businesses and individuals from the ‘maximum pressure’ sanctions regime are key problems that must be resolved,” he continued on Twitter.

EU omits powerful oligarch Oleg Deripaska from latest sanctions list

The European Union has not followed Britain’s lead in hitting Oleg Deripaska with sanctions, amid internal splits over the economic consequences of freezing the powerful Russian oligarch’s assets in countries such as Austria and Cyprus.

Deripaska, 54, is the founder of the major metals producer EN+ Group. He

was targeted by British sanctions last week[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/who-is-oleg-deripaska-and-the-other-oligarchs-sanctioned-by-the-uk-today-5297z2gmf]

but diplomatic sources said that European governments were too divided to include him in a fourth round of sanctions.

Brussels officials played down Deripaska’s absence

from a list of 15 people set to receive the freezing of assets and travel bans[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/eu-to-hit-14-russian-oligarchs-with-tougher-sanctions-f9hxk3wmz]

, stressing that “it is not a race to sanction” and that each of the 27 EU countries “has its reasons”.

“Comparing with other countries or partners is not always ideal or possible considering the ramifications extending to assets they control, different context and legal situation,” said an official.

Another diplomatic source said: “Unity of all 27 member states is needed and Deripaska would not fly with some member states so he is not on the list.”

EU measures that enter into force today ban new investments in the Russian energy sector, block all “high-end” luxury exports and end imports of steel products from Russia.

Roman Abramovich, 55, the oligarch and owner of Chelsea Football Club, is added to the EU sanctions list along with ten other wealthy Russian business people associated with investment and fertiliser sectors.

The blacklisting of Abramovich could create problems for the club’s playing of European football matches, and an official said it would be up to each national authority “to identify if providing services to Chelsea would constitute services to Abramovich”. Chelsea play at Lille in northern France tomorrow in the Champions League.

Other far-reaching sanctions will ban the export of any luxury goods, including horses, jewellery, pearls, diamonds, clocks, watches, wines, truffles, leather goods and carpets with a value of more than €300. Also included in the luxury blockade, worth some €3.5 billion in trade, are “wigs, false beards, eyebrows and eyelashes”.

The export of cars or SUVs worth more than €50,000 will be banned as well as trade in electronic audio and camera goods valued above €1,000. Exports of musical instruments of a value exceeding €1,500 will also be forbidden.

“The distinction is between what the ordinary Russian might buy and what impacts the lifestyle of a particular section of the wealthy and well connected Russian elite,” an official said.

Sanctions are also extended to cover all investments and similar transactions with state-owned Russian companies, including Gazprom and Rosneft in the energy sector, but excluding railways and certain other public services.

Officials said the measure would amount to “a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector” but would not target supplies of gas or oil.

“All energy companies are covered but supply is still maintained,” they said. “No new upstream investment in the Russian energy sector, no new joint ventures, no loans and no increased stakes.”

RWE, Germany’s top power producer and a buyer of Russian gas, warned today that any moves to stop energy imports from Russia would have “notable effects on our assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss”.

“We must unfortunately acknowledge that there is a strong dependence on Russia, especially in energy supply, in Europe and in particular in Germany,” added Markus Krebber, chief executive.

The EU,

the G7 (including Britain and the US)[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/g7-allies-mull-steep-trade-tariffs-on-russian-products-such-as-vodka-f9mmgn5mb]

, along with Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, Norway and others have stripped Russia of preferential trading terms at the World Trade Organisation.

“This unprecedented decision sends a political signal of the highest magnitude,” said Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU’s trade commissioner. “In practice, it deprives Russia of key trade advantages as a WTO member. It therefore deepens Russia’s pariah status in the eyes of the global community.”

Other blacklisted individuals include Konstantin Ernst, the head of Russia’s state-owned Channel One television and three other prominent Russian broadcasters. Ernst is the boss of the presenter

Marina Ovsyannikova[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russian-tv-editor-denounces-state-lies-live-on-air-vb6pqjm99]

, who was arrested after staging a protest against the war during a news bulletin yesterday.

Kremlin Calls For Austrian And Swedish Models For Ukrainian Neutrality

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov indicated that Moscow is currently discussing the idea of Austrian and Swedish models of neutrality for Ukraine as part of its talks with Kyiv.

According to Peskov this would mean that Ukraine would be able to retain its military but will not be allowed to have foreign military bases.

This implies that Russia may be amenable to Ukraine joining the European Union in some capacity similar to both Sweden and Austria.

Russia Indicates Parts Of A Deal With Ukraine Is Close, Kyiv Neutral Status Under 'Serious' Consideration

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday indicated that some parts of a probable deal with Ukraine are close to being agreed upon with neutral status for Kyiv being seriously considered.

In an interview [https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-lavrov-says-neutrality-ukraine-being-seriously-discussed-2022-03-16/] with Russia’s RBC news outlet Lavrov said: “Neutral status is now being seriously discussed along, of course, with security guarantees. The Russian minister however warned that negotiations were not easy but there is no some hope of a compromise.

According to Lavrov, the security of people in eastern Ukraine, demilitarization and the right of Russian speaking people in the country were key points of discussion.

In an address on Tuesday, Zelensky also appeared to indicate [https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/europe/ukraine-nato-zelensky-shift/index.html] that Kyiv had cooled on joining NATO stating that: “For years we have been hearing about how the door is supposedly open (to NATO membership) but now we hear that we cannot enter. And it is true, and it must be acknowledged.”

At Least Two People Injured As Russian Strikes Target Residential Buildings In Kyiv

At least two people were injured after the top floor of a 12-story residential building partially collapsed following a Russian strike on Wednesday morning, Ukraine’s State Emergency Services said [https://www.facebook.com/MNS.GOV.UA/posts/333597482141481] on Facebook .

The affected building is located in the Shevchenkivskyi district, just a few miles from Kyiv’s city center. A nine-story building in the neighborhood also sustained minor damages from the strike.

The emergency services said they were able to evacuate 37 people from the building, including the two who were injured.

Russian Forces Struggling With Ukrainian Terrain, U.K. Defense Ministry Says

Russian forces are “struggling to overcome” the challenges posed by the Ukrainian terrain, causing their progress to stall, the U.K. defense ministry said in its daily intelligence update [https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1503982627522494465] on Tuesday.

The report said advancing Russian columns have largely been tied down to using Ukraine’s road network for transport and their mobility has been further restricted by the destruction of key bridges by the Ukrainian forces.

Observers [https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/03/mud-in-ukraine-history-of-russian-army-and-rasputitsa.html] have warned [https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220308-ukraine-thaw-could-slow-russian-advance-in-mud] that the Russia’s movements could be severely hampered by the phenomenon known colloquially as ‘rasputitsa’ or ‘rasputitsia’. This refers to the season when thawing snow in the spring and wet weather lead to severely muddy conditions that either slows down or halts the movement of heavy armor or other military vehicles outside paved roads. This phenomenon played a key role in dooming both Hitler and Napoleon’s invasion of the region in the past.

The British update also noted that Ukrainian forces have managed to inflict heavy losses on the invading Russians by taking advantage of Russia’s lack of maneuverability.

China Would Have Tried To Prevent 'Crisis' In Ukraine If It Had Prior Knowledge, Chinese Ambassador Says

China would have tried its best to prevent the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine if it had know about the “imminent crisis,” China’s ambassador to the U.S. Qin Gang wrote in an op-ed [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/15/china-ambassador-us-where-we-stand-in-ukraine/] for the Washington Post on Wednesday.

Qin pushed back against claims that China had prior knowledge of “Russia’s military action” and denied that it demanded Moscow delay invasion until the end of the Beijing Winter Olympics.

“Assertions that China knew about, acquiesced to or tacitly supported this war are purely disinformation...China is the biggest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine, and the largest importer of crude oil and natural gas in the world. Conflict between Russia and Ukraine does no good for China,” Qin wrote.

Qin also pushed back against comparisons between Ukraine and Taiwan noting the former is a “sovereign state” while the latter is “an inseparable part of China’s territory.”

Zelensky Hails Courageous Visit To Kyiv By Three European Prime Ministers

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a statement [https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/volodimir-zelenskij-u-kiyevi-zustrivsya-z-golovami-uryadiv-p-73585] thanking the leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia for their visit to Kyiv on Tuesday and urged other leaders to do the same.

After arriving in Kyiv on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki, Deputy Prime Minister of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński , Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Petr Fiala and Prime Minister of Slovenia Janez Janša met Zelensky and other members of his cabinet in Kyiv, which continues to be targeted by Russian strikes.

In his statement, Zelensky hailed the four leaders, stating that they “fear nothing” and care more about the fate of Ukraine. “I am sure that with such friends, with such countries, with such neighbors and partners, we will really be able to win,” he added.

The talks between the leaders focused on security guarantees for Ukraine, the prospects of Ukraine joining the EU and more sanctions against Russia.

Later in a statement posted on his official Telegram channel, Zelensky wrote: “I invite all friends of Ukraine to visit Kyiv.”

Ukraine Claims The Death Of A Fourth Russian General

Ukrainian officials on Wednesday claimed that a fourth Russian general has been killed in the battlefield.

The Associated Press, citing Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko , reported [https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-business-global-trade-europe-d3fc8e510956c63a8d7b53efb8700c9e] that Russian Major General Oleg Mityaev was killed on Tuesday as his troops tried to mount an assault on Mariupol.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also mentioned the death of a fourth Russian general in his video address on Tuesday night, but did not share any other details, including his name.

A graphic image, purportedly showing Mityaev’s dead body was shared by Gerashchenko and some Ukrainian journalists on Telegram. While the dead soldier’s face was partially covered by his helmet in the image, an insignia with a single star was visible, implying that he held a major general’s rank.

Mitayev previously served [https://ria.ru/20210509/parad-1731570695.html] as the the Deputy Commander of Russian Forces in Syria.

Russia has not yet confirmed Ukrainian claims about his death.

Zelensky Urges Russian Officials To Quit Their Jobs

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky encouraged Russian government officials to resign in a late-night speech, arguing they could face worldwide rebuke if they assist with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Quit! A few months without a job is definitely better for you than a lifetime of international persecution,” Zelensky said, according to a translation released by his office [https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/opir-stijkist-ta-horobrist-nashih-zahisnikiv-dayut-zmogu-zbe-73589].

The United States and its allies have sanctioned dozens [https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0650] of Russian elites and government officials in recent weeks, including [https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisakim/2022/02/25/eu-prepares-to-freeze-putin-and-lavrovs-assets/] Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov .

Zelensky also encouraged individual Russians to push back, warning the sanctions levied against Russia in recent weeks will leave the country with “shame and poverty” and “years of isolation.”

Zelensky—a native Russian speaker—has attempted to address the Russian public in the past. In a Tuesday morning speech [https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/vidpovidalnist-za-voyenni-zlochini-dlya-rosijskih-vijskovih-73561], he thanked the protesters who have gathered in some Russian cities to push back against the war and encouraged [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/world/europe/zelensky-russian-troops-surrender.html] Russian soldiers to surrender voluntarily.

Senate Passes Resolution Condemning Putin—And Calling For War Crimes Investigation

The U.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution [https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/27e5529f-738a-4d77-80b7-23bf5983b7f3/war-crimes-resolution.pdf] Tuesday condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin , along with members of the Russian security council and the Russian armed forces, for “ongoing violence, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and systematic human rights abuses” in Ukraine and elsewhere.

The resolution, sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), pointed to acts the International Criminal Court (ICC) identifies as war crimes, including intentional attacks on civilians. The resolution calls on the ICC and the International Court of Justice to authorize investigations into war crimes allegedly committed by Putin and the Russian military.

The ICC opened an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine earlier this month. The process is likely to be slow: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2022/03/06/war-crimes-in-ukraine-heres-what-russias-been-accused-of-and-what-comes-next/?sh=618c0bdb23c4] The ICC has issued just 35 arrest warrants and secured 10 convictions since it was founded two decades ago, and even if the ICC determines there is sufficient evidence to file charges, the Hague-based organization relies on its 123 member states—a list that doesn’t include the United States or Russia—to make arrests.

The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed [https://ukraine.un.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/Ukraine%20-%20civilian%20casualty%20update%20as%20of%2024.00%2013%20March%202022%20ENG.pdf] Monday more than 600 civilians have died since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, though it believes the actual figure is probably much higher. Most of the deaths were caused by explosive weapons, according to the report.

Graham appeared to call [https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1499574209567199235?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499574209567199235%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fembedly.forbes.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Dcfc0fb0733504c77aa4a6ac07caaffc7schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Flindseygrahamsc%2Fstatus%2F1499574209567199235image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3D8804248494c144f5b4765c41f66c6ed5] for Putin’s assassination earlier this month on Twitter , asking for a “Brutus” in Russia to “take this guy out.”

Ukraine Reportedly Plans To Request Drones And Other Advanced Equipment From U.S.

Ukraine will request more military equipment from the United States when President Volodymyr Zelensky addresses lawmakers Wednesday, two unnamed European diplomats told [https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/15/world/ukraine-russia-war] the New York Times Tuesday.

Ukraine will reportedly ask for armed drones and more advanced mobile air defense systems. Since Russia invaded, the U.S. has supplied Ukraine with Javelin [https://www.cbsnews.com/video/ukraine-leans-on-us-made-javelin-anti-tank-missiles/] anti-tank missiles and Stinger [https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-stinger-deliveries-to-ukraine-followed-long-search-for-technical-fix-11646773886] surface-to-air missiles, and Ukraine has used Turkish-made [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/us/politics/ukraine-military-drones-russia.html] surface-to-air missiles, and Ukraine has Bayraktar TB2 drones [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraine-drones-great-effect-russian-forces-pentagon-updates/story?id=83391603].

Biden is expected to announce another $1 billion in Ukrainian military aid Wednesday, sending more Stingers and Javelins to Ukraine, unnamed U.S. officials told [https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-to-announce-1-billion-in-new-military-aid-to-ukraine-wednesday-11647384130?st=0ab93n1po087nq9&reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter] the Wall Street Journal Tuesday. The funding will come out of the $13.6 billion set aside for Ukrainian aid in a $1.5 trillion annual spending bill Congress passed last week.

The Times reported that Ukrainian officials think the Biden Administration might be more willing to supply Ukraine with drones and mobile air defense equipment than the Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets it declined to send last week. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said these planes—which the Polish government offered to send to a U.S. base in order to transfer them to Ukraine—were unlikely to significantly increase the Ukrainian air force’s effectiveness, and Russia may view sending them as an escalatory act.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday sending these jets to Ukraine is “still under discussion,” and called on the Biden Administration to assist Ukraine in every way it can, short of sending U.S. troops to Ukraine or implementing a no-fly zone.

Russia Bringing More Troops To Ukraine From Afar As Invasion Stalls, U.K. Says

The Russian military is likely “struggling to conduct offensive operations” amid stiff Ukrainian resistance and heavy losses, forcing it to recruit foreign fighters and deploy troops from the far reaches of Russia, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence update [https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1503851779175370760] Tuesday.

Personnel from the Russian Far East [https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2022-02-28/russia-to-move-far-east-troops-closer-to-europe-ifax] and the Pacific Fleet—as well as troops in allied Armenia [https://www.reuters.com/article/armenia-azerbaijan-russia-base-int/armenia-seeks-bigger-russian-military-presence-on-its-territory-idUSKBN2AM1DY] —are redeploying, the Ministry of Defense said. Russia is also seeking to use private mercenaries and fighters from Syria, according to the update, following earlier reports that Russia is currently recruiting Syrians [https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-recruiting-syrians-for-urban-combat-in-ukraine-u-s-officials-say-11646606234] with urban combat experience and had sent military contractors from the secretive Wagner Group [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/world/europe/russian-ukraine-mercenaries.html] into eastern Ukraine before the invasion.

The Ministry of Defense didn’t specify how many troops have been redeployed, or whether any of these additional fighters have entered Ukraine yet.

Russia may use the additional forces to “hold captured territory and free up its combat power to renew stalled offensive operations,” the update said.

U.S. To Send $186 million In Humanitarian Aid For Ukrainian Refugees

The U.S. will provide over $186 million in humanitarian aid for Ukrainians displaced by Russia’s invasion, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced [https://www.state.gov/additional-humanitarian-assistance-for-the-people-of-ukraine/] Tuesday.

Blinken said the funds will assist humanitarian organizations and Ukraine’s neighboring countries, which have welcomed more than 3 million refugees since Russia invaded three weeks ago, according [https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine] to the United Nations.

Blinken notes that the U.S. has provided nearly $300 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine and the surrounding region in the last month—the largest amount from any single nation.

McConnell Says Biden Administration Is ‘Dragging Its Heels’ In Assisting Ukraine

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) criticized the Biden Administration on Tuesday for “dragging its heels” on military assistance to Ukraine, after the federal government decided not to back a plan to provide fighter jets to the Ukrainian air force.

“It seems to me, the president believes that any effort to help the Ukrainians is potentially provocative to the Russians,” McConnell said while addressing the media.

McConnell said he agrees with President Joe Biden that U.S. troops should not be sent to Ukraine, but there are “a lot of weapons that are extremely effective at controlling the air.” McConnell pointed to the Polish government’s offer to send its Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. base for eventual transfer to Ukraine, an offer the Biden Administration declined.

The United States and its allies have sent weapons to Ukraine, including Stinger [https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-stinger-deliveries-to-ukraine-followed-long-search-for-technical-fix-11646773886] surface-to-air missiles and Javelin [https://www.cbsnews.com/video/ukraine-leans-on-us-made-javelin-anti-tank-missiles/] anti-tank missiles. However, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said last week the MiG-29 planes were “not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian air force,” and could be taken as an escalatory act by Russia.

In a letter [https://www.ernst.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/27f1a32f-aa03-460b-a6da-05fd93b251a0/EEAC805CD285FCBD6B3AE1C0ED6869A0.2022-03-10-final-ernst-ukraine-letter-to-biden.pdf] addressed to the administration last week, McConnell and 41 other Republican senators urged Biden to reconsider this decision. McConnell said Tuesday the possibility of sending MiG-29 fighter jets is “still under discussion.”

When asked whether the United States should sanction China if it elects to assist Russia by supplying it with military aid, McConnell said he is “open to applying any pressure we possibly can” to countries that help Russia.

Kremlin Calls For Austrian And Swedish Models For Neutrality — But Ukrainian Negotiator Rejects Proposal

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov indicated that Moscow is currently discussing the idea of Austrian and Swedish models of neutrality for Ukraine as part of its talks with Kyiv, but a Ukrainian official rejected the model, saying the security model “can only be Ukrainian.”

Mykhailo Podolyak , an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky participating in the negotiations, said in a Telegram post [https://t.me/M_Podolyak/7] that because Ukraine is now in a war with Russia, the security model has to have “legally verified security guarantees,” adding there can be “no other models or options.”

Podolyak said Ukraine’s model would have “absolute security guarantees, which would mean that the signatories of guarantees do not stand aside in the event of an attack on Ukraine, as it is today.” He also added that Ukraine does not want to “depend on bureaucratic structures” to get a no-fly zone [https://www.axios.com/ukraine-no-fly-zone-meaning-nato-biden-0cbf80c4-c403-419a-b696-60327cee6387.html] —a request officials have been making for weeks, to little success.

According to Peskov, an Austrian or Swedish model of neutrality for Ukraine would mean it would be able to retain its military, but would not be allowed to have foreign military bases. This implies that Russia may be amenable to Ukraine joining the European Union in some capacity similar to both Sweden and Austria.

Russia Indicates Parts Of A Deal With Ukraine Is Close, Kyiv Neutral Status Under 'Serious' Consideration

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday indicated that some parts of a probable deal with Ukraine are close to being agreed upon with neutral status for Kyiv being seriously considered.

In an interview [https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-lavrov-says-neutrality-ukraine-being-seriously-discussed-2022-03-16/] with Russia’s RBC news outlet Lavrov said: “Neutral status is now being seriously discussed along, of course, with security guarantees. The Russian minister however warned that negotiations were not easy but there is no some hope of a compromise.

According to Lavrov, the security of people in eastern Ukraine, demilitarization and the right of Russian speaking people in the country were key points of discussion.

In an address on Tuesday, Zelensky also appeared to indicate [https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/europe/ukraine-nato-zelensky-shift/index.html] that Kyiv had cooled on joining NATO stating that: “For years we have been hearing about how the door is supposedly open (to NATO membership) but now we hear that we cannot enter.

Russian Forces Struggling With Ukrainian Terrain, U.K. Defense Ministry Says

Russian forces are “struggling to overcome” the challenges posed by the Ukrainian terrain, causing their progress to stall, the U.K. defense ministry said in its daily intelligence update [https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1503982627522494465] on Tuesday.

The report said advancing Russian columns have largely been tied down to using Ukraine’s road network for transport and their mobility has been further restricted by the destruction of key bridges by the Ukrainian forces.

Observers [https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/03/mud-in-ukraine-history-of-russian-army-and-rasputitsa.html] have warned [https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220308-ukraine-thaw-could-slow-russian-advance-in-mud] that the Russia’s movements could be severely hampered by the phenomenon known colloquially as ‘rasputitsa’ or ‘rasputitsia’. This refers to the season when thawing snow in the spring and wet weather lead to severely muddy conditions that either slows down or halts the movement of heavy armor or other military vehicles outside paved roads. This phenomenon played a key role in dooming both Hitler and Napoleon’s invasion of the region in the past.

The British update also noted that Ukrainian forces have managed to inflict heavy losses on the invading Russians by taking advantage of Russia’s lack of maneuverability.

China Would Have Tried To Prevent 'Crisis' In Ukraine If It Had Prior Knowledge, Chinese Ambassador Says

China would have tried its best to prevent the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine if it had know about the “imminent crisis,” China’s ambassador to the U.S. Qin Gang wrote in an op-ed [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/15/china-ambassador-us-where-we-stand-in-ukraine/] for the Washington Post on Wednesday.

Qin pushed back against claims that China had prior knowledge of “Russia’s military action” and denied that it demanded Moscow delay invasion until the end of the Beijing Winter Olympics.

“Assertions that China knew about, acquiesced to or tacitly supported this war are purely disinformation...China is the biggest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine, and the largest importer of crude oil and natural gas in the world. Conflict between Russia and Ukraine does no good for China,” Qin wrote.

Qin also pushed back against comparisons between Ukraine and Taiwan noting the former is a “sovereign state” while the latter is “an inseparable part of China’s territory.”

Zelensky Hails Courageous Visit To Kyiv By Three European Prime Ministers

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a statement [https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/volodimir-zelenskij-u-kiyevi-zustrivsya-z-golovami-uryadiv-p-73585] thanking the leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia for their visit to Kyiv on Tuesday and urged other leaders to do the same.

After arriving in Kyiv on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki, Deputy Prime Minister of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński , Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Petr Fiala and Prime Minister of Slovenia Janez Janša met Zelensky and other members of his cabinet in Kyiv, which continues to be targeted by Russian strikes.

In his statement, Zelensky hailed the four leaders, stating that they “fear nothing” and care more about the fate of Ukraine. “I am sure that with such friends, with such countries, with such neighbors and partners, we will really be able to win,” he added.

The talks between the leaders focused on security guarantees for Ukraine, the prospects of Ukraine joining the EU and more sanctions against Russia.

Later in a statement posted on his official Telegram channel, Zelensky wrote: “I invite all friends of Ukraine to visit Kyiv.”

Ukraine Claims The Death Of A Fourth Russian General

Ukrainian officials on Wednesday claimed that a fourth Russian general has been killed in the battlefield.

The Associated Press, citing Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko , reported [https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-business-global-trade-europe-d3fc8e510956c63a8d7b53efb8700c9e] that Russian Major General Oleg Mityaev was killed on Tuesday as his troops tried to mount an assault on Mariupol.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also mentioned the death of a fourth Russian general in his video address on Tuesday night, but did not share any other details, including his name.

A graphic image, purportedly showing Mityaev’s dead body was shared by Gerashchenko and some Ukrainian journalists on Telegram. While the dead soldier’s face was partially covered by his helmet in the image, an insignia with a single star was visible, implying that he held a major general’s rank.

Mitayev previously served [https://ria.ru/20210509/parad-1731570695.html] as the the Deputy Commander of Russian Forces in Syria.

Russia has not yet confirmed Ukrainian claims about his death.

Zelensky Urges Russian Officials To Quit Their Jobs

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky encouraged Russian government officials to resign in a late-night speech, arguing they could face worldwide rebuke if they assist with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Quit! A few months without a job is definitely better for you than a lifetime of international persecution,” Zelensky said, according to a translation released by his office [https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/opir-stijkist-ta-horobrist-nashih-zahisnikiv-dayut-zmogu-zbe-73589].

The United States and its allies have sanctioned dozens [https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0650] of Russian elites and government officials in recent weeks, including [https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisakim/2022/02/25/eu-prepares-to-freeze-putin-and-lavrovs-assets/] Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov .

Zelensky also encouraged individual Russians to push back, warning the sanctions levied against Russia in recent weeks will leave the country with “shame and poverty” and “years of isolation.”

Zelensky—a native Russian speaker—has attempted to address the Russian public in the past. In a Tuesday morning speech [https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/vidpovidalnist-za-voyenni-zlochini-dlya-rosijskih-vijskovih-73561], he thanked the protesters who have gathered in some Russian cities to push back against the war and encouraged [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/world/europe/zelensky-russian-troops-surrender.html] Russian soldiers to surrender voluntarily.

Senate Passes Resolution Condemning Putin—And Calling For War Crimes Investigation

The U.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution [https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/27e5529f-738a-4d77-80b7-23bf5983b7f3/war-crimes-resolution.pdf] Tuesday condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin , along with members of the Russian security council and the Russian armed forces, for “ongoing violence, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and systematic human rights abuses” in Ukraine and elsewhere.

The resolution, sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), pointed to acts the International Criminal Court (ICC) identifies as war crimes, including intentional attacks on civilians. The resolution calls on the ICC and the International Court of Justice to authorize investigations into war crimes allegedly committed by Putin and the Russian military.

The ICC opened an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine earlier this month. The process is likely to be slow: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2022/03/06/war-crimes-in-ukraine-heres-what-russias-been-accused-of-and-what-comes-next/?sh=618c0bdb23c4] The ICC has issued just 35 arrest warrants and secured 10 convictions since it was founded two decades ago, and even if the ICC determines there is sufficient evidence to file charges, the Hague-based organization relies on its 123 member states—a list that doesn’t include the United States or Russia—to make arrests.

The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed [https://ukraine.un.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/Ukraine%20-%20civilian%20casualty%20update%20as%20of%2024.00%2013%20March%202022%20ENG.pdf] Monday more than 600 civilians have died since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, though it believes the actual figure is probably much higher. Most of the deaths were caused by explosive weapons, according to the report.

Graham appeared to call [https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1499574209567199235?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499574209567199235%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fembedly.forbes.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Dcfc0fb0733504c77aa4a6ac07caaffc7schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Flindseygrahamsc%2Fstatus%2F1499574209567199235image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3D8804248494c144f5b4765c41f66c6ed5] for Putin’s assassination earlier this month on Twitter , asking for a “Brutus” in Russia to “take this guy out.”

Ukraine Reportedly Plans To Request Drones And Other Advanced Equipment From U.S.

Ukraine will request more military equipment from the United States when President Volodymyr Zelensky addresses lawmakers Wednesday, two unnamed European diplomats told [https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/15/world/ukraine-russia-war] the New York Times Tuesday.

Ukraine will reportedly ask for armed drones and more advanced mobile air defense systems. Since Russia invaded, the U.S. has supplied Ukraine with Javelin [https://www.cbsnews.com/video/ukraine-leans-on-us-made-javelin-anti-tank-missiles/] anti-tank missiles and Stinger [https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-stinger-deliveries-to-ukraine-followed-long-search-for-technical-fix-11646773886] surface-to-air missiles, and Ukraine has used Turkish-made [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/us/politics/ukraine-military-drones-russia.html] surface-to-air missiles, and Ukraine has Bayraktar TB2 drones [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraine-drones-great-effect-russian-forces-pentagon-updates/story?id=83391603].

Biden is expected to announce another $1 billion in Ukrainian military aid Wednesday, sending more Stingers and Javelins to Ukraine, unnamed U.S. officials told [https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-to-announce-1-billion-in-new-military-aid-to-ukraine-wednesday-11647384130?st=0ab93n1po087nq9&reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter] the Wall Street Journal Tuesday. The funding will come out of the $13.6 billion set aside for Ukrainian aid in a $1.5 trillion annual spending bill Congress passed last week.

The Times reported that Ukrainian officials think the Biden Administration might be more willing to supply Ukraine with drones and mobile air defense equipment than the Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets it declined to send last week. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said these planes—which the Polish government offered to send to a U.S. base in order to transfer them to Ukraine—were unlikely to significantly increase the Ukrainian air force’s effectiveness, and Russia may view sending them as an escalatory act.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday sending these jets to Ukraine is “still under discussion,” and called on the Biden Administration to assist Ukraine in every way it can, short of sending U.S. troops to Ukraine or implementing a no-fly zone.

Russia Bringing More Troops To Ukraine From Afar As Invasion Stalls, U.K. Says

The Russian military is likely “struggling to conduct offensive operations” amid stiff Ukrainian resistance and heavy losses, forcing it to recruit foreign fighters and deploy troops from the far reaches of Russia, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence update [https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1503851779175370760] Tuesday.

Personnel from the Russian Far East [https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2022-02-28/russia-to-move-far-east-troops-closer-to-europe-ifax] and the Pacific Fleet—as well as troops in allied Armenia [https://www.reuters.com/article/armenia-azerbaijan-russia-base-int/armenia-seeks-bigger-russian-military-presence-on-its-territory-idUSKBN2AM1DY] —are redeploying, the Ministry of Defense said. Russia is also seeking to use private mercenaries and fighters from Syria, according to the update, following earlier reports that Russia is currently recruiting Syrians [https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-recruiting-syrians-for-urban-combat-in-ukraine-u-s-officials-say-11646606234] with urban combat experience and had sent military contractors from the secretive Wagner Group [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/world/europe/russian-ukraine-mercenaries.html] into eastern Ukraine before the invasion.

The Ministry of Defense didn’t specify how many troops have been redeployed, or whether any of these additional fighters have entered Ukraine yet.

Russia may use the additional forces to “hold captured territory and free up its combat power to renew stalled offensive operations,” the update said. The Russian military has captured several cities in southern Ukraine, but its advance toward Kyiv has been slow and halting amid fierce Ukrainian resistance.

U.S. To Send $186 million In Humanitarian Aid For Ukrainian Refugees

The U.S. will provide over $186 million in humanitarian aid for Ukrainians displaced by Russia’s invasion, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced [https://www.state.gov/additional-humanitarian-assistance-for-the-people-of-ukraine/] Tuesday.

Blinken said the funds will assist humanitarian organizations and Ukraine’s neighboring countries, which have welcomed more than 3 million refugees since Russia invaded three weeks ago, according [https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine] to the United Nations.

Blinken notes that the U.S. has provided nearly $300 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine and the surrounding region in the last month—the largest amount from any single nation. Last week, the U.S. Senate passed [https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/03/15/biden-signs-15-trillion-spending-bill-with-14-billion-for-ukraine-aid-heres-whats-in-it/?sh=154c40032214] a $1.5 trillion annual spending bill that included another $13.6 billion in assistance to Ukraine, $4 billion of which would be used to help refugees.

McConnell Says Biden Administration Is ‘Dragging Its Heels’ In Assisting Ukraine

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) criticized the Biden Administration on Tuesday for “dragging its heels” on military assistance to Ukraine, after the federal government decided not to back a plan to provide fighter jets to the Ukrainian air force.

“It seems to me, the president believes that any effort to help the Ukrainians is potentially provocative to the Russians,” McConnell said while addressing the media.

McConnell said he agrees with President Joe Biden that U.S. troops should not be sent to Ukraine, but there are “a lot of weapons that are extremely effective at controlling the air.” McConnell pointed to the Polish government’s offer to send its Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. base for eventual transfer to Ukraine, an offer the Biden Administration declined.

The United States and its allies have sent weapons to Ukraine, including Stinger [https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-stinger-deliveries-to-ukraine-followed-long-search-for-technical-fix-11646773886] surface-to-air missiles and Javelin [https://www.cbsnews.com/video/ukraine-leans-on-us-made-javelin-anti-tank-missiles/] anti-tank missiles. However, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said last week the MiG-29 planes were “not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian air force,” and could be taken as an escalatory act by Russia.

In a letter [https://www.ernst.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/27f1a32f-aa03-460b-a6da-05fd93b251a0/EEAC805CD285FCBD6B3AE1C0ED6869A0.2022-03-10-final-ernst-ukraine-letter-to-biden.pdf] addressed to the administration last week, McConnell and 41 other Republican senators urged Biden to reconsider this decision. McConnell said Tuesday the possibility of sending MiG-29 fighter jets is “still under discussion.”

When asked whether the United States should sanction China if it elects to assist Russia by supplying it with military aid, McConnell said he is “open to applying any pressure we possibly can” to countries that help Russia.

Russian Forces Struggling With Ukrainian Terrain, U.K. Defense Ministry Says

Russian forces are “struggling to overcome” the challenges posed by the Ukrainian terrain, causing their progress to stall, the U.K. defense ministry said in its daily intelligence update [https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1503982627522494465] on Tuesday.

The report said advancing Russian columns have largely been tied down to using Ukraine’s road network for transport and their mobility has been further restricted by the destruction of key bridges by the Ukrainian forces.

Observers [https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/03/mud-in-ukraine-history-of-russian-army-and-rasputitsa.html] have warned [https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220308-ukraine-thaw-could-slow-russian-advance-in-mud] that the Russia’s movements could be severely hampered by the phenomenon known colloquially as ‘rasputitsa’ or ‘rasputitsia’. This refers to the season when thawing snow in the spring and wet weather lead to severely muddy conditions that either slows down or halts the movement of heavy armor or other military vehicles outside paved roads. This phenomenon played a key role in dooming both Hitler and Napoleon’s invasion of the region in the past.

The British update also noted that Ukrainian forces have managed to inflict heavy losses on the invading Russians by taking advantage of Russia’s lack of maneuverability.

China Would Have Tried To Prevent 'Crisis' In Ukraine If It Had Prior Knowledge, Chinese Ambassador Says

China would have tried its best to prevent the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine if it had know about the “imminent crisis,” China’s ambassador to the U.S. Qin Gang wrote in an op-ed [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/15/china-ambassador-us-where-we-stand-in-ukraine/] for the Washington Post on Wednesday.

Qin pushed back against claims that China had prior knowledge of “Russia’s military action” and denied that it demanded Moscow delay invasion until the end of the Beijing Winter Olympics.

“Assertions that China knew about, acquiesced to or tacitly supported this war are purely disinformation...China is the biggest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine, and the largest importer of crude oil and natural gas in the world. Conflict between Russia and Ukraine does no good for China,” Qin wrote.

Qin also pushed back against comparisons between Ukraine and Taiwan noting the former is a “sovereign state” while the latter is “an inseparable part of China’s territory.”

Zelensky Hails Courageous Visit To Kyiv By Three European Prime Ministers

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a statement [https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/volodimir-zelenskij-u-kiyevi-zustrivsya-z-golovami-uryadiv-p-73585] thanking the leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia for their visit to Kyiv on Tuesday and urged other leaders to do the same.

After arriving in Kyiv on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki, Deputy Prime Minister of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński , Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Petr Fiala and Prime Minister of Slovenia Janez Janša met Zelensky and other members of his cabinet in Kyiv, which continues to be targeted by Russian strikes.

In his statement, Zelensky hailed the four leaders, stating that they “fear nothing” and care more about the fate of Ukraine. “I am sure that with such friends, with such countries, with such neighbors and partners, we will really be able to win,” he added.

The talks between the leaders focused on security guarantees for Ukraine, the prospects of Ukraine joining the EU and more sanctions against Russia.

Later in a statement posted on his official Telegram channel, Zelensky wrote: “I invite all friends of Ukraine to visit Kyiv.”

Ukraine Claims The Death Of A Fourth Russian General

Ukrainian officials on Wednesday claimed that a fourth Russian general has been killed in the battlefield.

The Associated Press, citing Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko , reported [https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-business-global-trade-europe-d3fc8e510956c63a8d7b53efb8700c9e] that Russian Major General Oleg Mityaev was killed on Tuesday as his troops tried to mount an assault on Mariupol.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also mentioned the death of a fourth Russian general in his video address on Tuesday night, but did not share any other details, including his name.

A graphic image, purportedly showing Mityaev’s dead body was shared by Gerashchenko and some Ukrainian journalists on Telegram. While the dead soldier’s face was partially covered by his helmet in the image, an insignia with a single star was visible, implying that he held a major general’s rank.

Mitayev previously served [https://ria.ru/20210509/parad-1731570695.html] as the the Deputy Commander of Russian Forces in Syria.

Russia has not yet confirmed Ukrainian claims about his death.

A few months without a job is definitely better for you than a lifetime of international persecution,” Zelensky said, according to a translation released by his office [https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/opir-stijkist-ta-horobrist-nashih-zahisnikiv-dayut-zmogu-zbe-73589].

The United States and its allies have sanctioned dozens [https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0650] of Russian elites and government officials in recent weeks, including [https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisakim/2022/02/25/eu-prepares-to-freeze-putin-and-lavrovs-assets/] Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov .

Zelensky also encouraged individual Russians to push back, warning the sanctions levied against Russia in recent weeks will leave the country with “shame and poverty” and “years of isolation.”

Zelensky—a native Russian speaker—has attempted to address the Russian public in the past. In a Tuesday morning speech [https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/vidpovidalnist-za-voyenni-zlochini-dlya-rosijskih-vijskovih-73561], he thanked the protesters who have gathered in some Russian cities to push back against the war and encouraged [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/world/europe/zelensky-russian-troops-surrender.html] Russian soldiers to surrender voluntarily.

Senate Passes Resolution Condemning Putin—And Calling For War Crimes Investigation

The U.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution [https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/27e5529f-738a-4d77-80b7-23bf5983b7f3/war-crimes-resolution.pdf] Tuesday condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin , along with members of the Russian security council and the Russian armed forces, for “ongoing violence, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and systematic human rights abuses” in Ukraine and elsewhere.

The resolution, sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), pointed to acts the International Criminal Court (ICC) identifies as war crimes, including intentional attacks on civilians. The resolution calls on the ICC and the International Court of Justice to authorize investigations into war crimes allegedly committed by Putin and the Russian military.

The ICC opened an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine earlier this month. The process is likely to be slow: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2022/03/06/war-crimes-in-ukraine-heres-what-russias-been-accused-of-and-what-comes-next/?sh=618c0bdb23c4] The ICC has issued just 35 arrest warrants and secured 10 convictions since it was founded two decades ago, and even if the ICC determines there is sufficient evidence to file charges, the Hague-based organization relies on its 123 member states—a list that doesn’t include the United States or Russia—to make arrests.

The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed [https://ukraine.un.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/Ukraine%20-%20civilian%20casualty%20update%20as%20of%2024.00%2013%20March%202022%20ENG.pdf] Monday more than 600 civilians have died since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, though it believes the actual figure is probably much higher. Most of the deaths were caused by explosive weapons, according to the report.

Ukraine Reportedly Plans To Request Drones And Other Advanced Equipment From U.S.

Ukraine will request more military equipment from the United States when President Volodymyr Zelensky addresses lawmakers Wednesday, two unnamed European diplomats told [https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/15/world/ukraine-russia-war] the New York Times Tuesday.

Ukraine will reportedly ask for armed drones and more advanced mobile air defense systems. Since Russia invaded, the U.S. has supplied Ukraine with Javelin [https://www.cbsnews.com/video/ukraine-leans-on-us-made-javelin-anti-tank-missiles/] anti-tank missiles and Stinger [https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-stinger-deliveries-to-ukraine-followed-long-search-for-technical-fix-11646773886] surface-to-air missiles, and Ukraine has used Turkish-made [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/us/politics/ukraine-military-drones-russia.html] surface-to-air missiles, and Ukraine has Bayraktar TB2 drones [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraine-drones-great-effect-russian-forces-pentagon-updates/story?id=83391603].

Biden is expected to announce another $1 billion in Ukrainian military aid Wednesday, sending more Stingers and Javelins to Ukraine, unnamed U.S. officials told [https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-to-announce-1-billion-in-new-military-aid-to-ukraine-wednesday-11647384130?st=0ab93n1po087nq9&reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter] the Wall Street Journal Tuesday. The funding will come out of the $13.6 billion set aside for Ukrainian aid in a $1.5 trillion annual spending bill Congress passed last week.

The Times reported that Ukrainian officials think the Biden Administration might be more willing to supply Ukraine with drones and mobile air defense equipment than the Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets it declined to send last week. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said these planes—which the Polish government offered to send to a U.S. base in order to transfer them to Ukraine—were unlikely to significantly increase the Ukrainian air force’s effectiveness, and Russia may view sending them as an escalatory act.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday sending these jets to Ukraine is “still under discussion,” and called on the Biden Administration to assist Ukraine in every way it can, short of sending U.S. troops to Ukraine or implementing a no-fly zone.

Russia Bringing More Troops To Ukraine From Afar As Invasion Stalls, U.K. Says

The Russian military is likely “struggling to conduct offensive operations” amid stiff Ukrainian resistance and heavy losses, forcing it to recruit foreign fighters and deploy troops from the far reaches of Russia, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence update [https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1503851779175370760] Tuesday.

Personnel from the Russian Far East [https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2022-02-28/russia-to-move-far-east-troops-closer-to-europe-ifax] and the Pacific Fleet—as well as troops in allied Armenia [https://www.reuters.com/article/armenia-azerbaijan-russia-base-int/armenia-seeks-bigger-russian-military-presence-on-its-territory-idUSKBN2AM1DY] —are redeploying, the Ministry of Defense said. Russia is also seeking to use private mercenaries and fighters from Syria, according to the update, following earlier reports that Russia is currently recruiting Syrians [https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-recruiting-syrians-for-urban-combat-in-ukraine-u-s-officials-say-11646606234] with urban combat experience and had sent military contractors from the secretive Wagner Group [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/world/europe/russian-ukraine-mercenaries.html] into eastern Ukraine before the invasion.

The Ministry of Defense didn’t specify how many troops have been redeployed, or whether any of these additional fighters have entered Ukraine yet.

Russia may use the additional forces to “hold captured territory and free up its combat power to renew stalled offensive operations,” the update said. The Russian military has captured several cities in southern Ukraine, but its advance toward Kyiv has been slow and halting amid fierce Ukrainian resistance.

U.S. To Send $186 million In Humanitarian Aid For Ukrainian Refugees

The U.S. will provide over $186 million in humanitarian aid for Ukrainians displaced by Russia’s invasion, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced [https://www.state.gov/additional-humanitarian-assistance-for-the-people-of-ukraine/] Tuesday.

Blinken said the funds will assist humanitarian organizations and Ukraine’s neighboring countries, which have welcomed more than 3 million refugees since Russia invaded three weeks ago, according [https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine] to the United Nations.

Blinken notes that the U.S. has provided nearly $300 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine and the surrounding region in the last month—the largest amount from any single nation. Last week, the U.S. Senate passed [https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/03/15/biden-signs-15-trillion-spending-bill-with-14-billion-for-ukraine-aid-heres-whats-in-it/?sh=154c40032214] a $1.5 trillion annual spending bill that included another $13.6 billion in assistance to Ukraine, $4 billion of which would be used to help refugees.

McConnell Says Biden Administration Is ‘Dragging Its Heels’ In Assisting Ukraine

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) criticized the Biden Administration on Tuesday for “dragging its heels” on military assistance to Ukraine, after the federal government decided not to back a plan to provide fighter jets to the Ukrainian air force.

“It seems to me, the president believes that any effort to help the Ukrainians is potentially provocative to the Russians,” McConnell said while addressing the media.

McConnell said he agrees with President Joe Biden that U.S. troops should not be sent to Ukraine, but there are “a lot of weapons that are extremely effective at controlling the air.” McConnell pointed to the Polish government’s offer to send its Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. base for eventual transfer to Ukraine, an offer the Biden Administration declined.

The United States and its allies have sent weapons to Ukraine, including Stinger [https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-stinger-deliveries-to-ukraine-followed-long-search-for-technical-fix-11646773886] surface-to-air missiles and Javelin [https://www.cbsnews.com/video/ukraine-leans-on-us-made-javelin-anti-tank-missiles/] anti-tank missiles. However, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said last week the MiG-29 planes were “not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian air force,” and could be taken as an escalatory act by Russia.

In a letter [https://www.ernst.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/27f1a32f-aa03-460b-a6da-05fd93b251a0/EEAC805CD285FCBD6B3AE1C0ED6869A0.2022-03-10-final-ernst-ukraine-letter-to-biden.pdf] addressed to the administration last week, McConnell and 41 other Republican senators urged Biden to reconsider this decision. McConnell said Tuesday the possibility of sending MiG-29 fighter jets is “still under discussion.”

When asked whether the United States should sanction China if it elects to assist Russia by supplying it with military aid, McConnell said he is “open to applying any pressure we possibly can” to countries that help Russia.

Vienna pushing for sanctions on more Russian oligarchs]]

The Austrian government is pushing to include more oligarchs in the fifth round of sanctions against Russia.

“More than 800 people are already covered by EU sanctions. We are in favour of expanding this list and adding more people close to the Russian President to the sanctions list,” said Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer on Wednesday as the Russian invasion of Ukraine enters its fourth week.

To this end, the Austrian representation in Brussels will present the government’s position to  extend the list of sanctioned persons, in particular further oligarchs, in a fifth sanctions package, a press release reads.

The government’s push to sanction more oligarchs comes amid allegations it had interjected on behalf of Oleg Deripaska.

Deripaska, who holds a stake in Russian arms manufacturing company GAZ, had been on initial EU sanctions lists according to media reports, but was removed from the final list.

Vienna had been reported to have interceded, given that Deripaska holds a third of the shares in Austria’s largest construction company STRABAG and is politically well-connected.

RBI is assessing all strategic options for the future of Raiffeisenbank Russia

Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) is a universal banking group operating in 13 markets across Central and Eastern Europe.

The war in Ukraine is having a devastating impact on the country's people and economy. Our thoughts and support are with all those people whose lives have tragically changed forever as a result of this war.

"This unprecedented situation leads RBI to consider its position in Russia. We are therefore assessing all strategic options for the future of Raiffeisenbank Russia, up to and including a carefully managed exit from Raiffeisenbank in Russia," said RBI-CEO Johann Strobl.

RBI and its subsidiary banks continue to operate in compliance with local and international sanction laws, changing financial market requirements, and in line with our Code of Conduct.

RBI's subsidiary banks are self-funded, well-capitalized, and have insignificant cross-border exposure to Russia. We have a duty of care to our employees and our customers. Across the RBI Group, we are doing everything we can to support them and the humanitarian effort.

As Ukraine war rages, diplomats near Iran nuclear agreement

WASHINGTON (AP) — As the war in Ukraine[https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-kyiv-europe-world-news-303fbd14ea7d3f131abc9b3d5739123f] rages on, diplomats trying to salvage the languishing 2015 Iran nuclear deal have been forging ahead with negotiations despite distractions caused by the conflict. They now appear to be near the cusp of a deal that would bring the U.S. back into the accord and bring Iran back into compliance with limits on its nuclear program.

After 11 months of on-and-off talks in Vienna[https://apnews.com/article/europe-middle-east-iran-donald-trump-iran-nuclear-4b3a674fe14f6cc4a1a9b0714e19e2d2], U.S. officials and others say only a very small number of issues remain to be resolved. Meanwhile, Russia appears to have backed down on a threat to crater an agreement over Ukraine-related sanctions that had dampened prospects for a quick deal.

That leaves an agreement — or at least an agreement in principle — up to political leaders in Washington and Tehran. But, as has been frequently the case, both Iran and the U.S. say those decisions must be made by the other side, leaving a resolution in limbo even as all involved say the matter is urgent and must be resolved as soon as possible.

“We are close to a possible deal, but we’re not there yet," State Department spokesman Ned Price said Wednesday. “We are going to find out in the near term whether we’re able to get there.”

Also Wednesday in Berlin, German Foreign Ministry spokesman Christofer Burger said work “on drafting a final text has been completed” and ”the necessary political decisions now need to be taken in capitals.”

“We hope that these negotiations can now be swiftly completed,” he said.

Reentering the 2015 deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, has been a priority for the Biden administration since it took office.

Once a signature foreign policy achievement of the Obama administration in which now-President Joe Biden served as vice president, the accord was abandoned in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump[https://apnews.com/article/north-america-donald-trump-ap-top-news-politics-iran-cead755353a1455bbef08ef289448994], who called it the worst deal ever negotiated and set about restoring and expanding on U.S. sanctions that had been lifted.

The Biden administration argues that any threat currently posed by Iran would be infinitely more dangerous should it obtain a nuclear weapon. Deal opponents, mostly but not entirely Republicans, say the original deal gave Iran a path to developing a nuclear bomb by removing various constraints under so-called “sunset" clauses. Those clauses meant that certain restrictions were to be gradually lifted.

Both sides' arguments gained intensity over the weekend when Iran targeted the northern Iraqi city of Irbil with missile strikes that hit near the U.S. consulate compound. For critics, the attack was proof that Iran cannot be trusted and should not be given any sanctions relief. For the administration, it confirmed that Iran would be a greater danger if it obtains a nuke.

“What it underscores for us is the fact that Iran poses a threat to our allies, to our partners, in some cases to the United States, across a range of realms,” Price said. “The most urgent challenge we would face is a nuclear-armed Iran or an Iran that was on the very precipice of obtaining a nuclear weapon.”

Meanwhile, a new glimmer of hope for progress emerged Wednesday when Iran released two detained British citizens[https://apnews.com/article/boris-johnson-middle-east-iran-europe-united-arab-emirates-42beb8e089a144c218e8f61e76eba34d]. The U.S., which withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018, and the three European countries that remain parties to it had said an agreement would be difficult if not impossible to reach while those prisoners, along with several American citizens, remain jailed in Iran.

Should the prisoner issue be resolved, Price said Tuesday, the gaps in the nuclear negotiations could be closed quickly if Iran makes the political decision to return to compliance.

“We do think that we would be in a position to close those gaps, to close that remaining distance if there are decisions made in capitals, including in Tehran,” Price said.

Yet, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdolahian said a deal depends entirely on Washington.

“More than ever, (the) ball is in U.S. court to provide the responses needed for successful conclusion of the talks,” he said after meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday. Amirabdolahian said he had been “reassured that Russia remains on board for the final agreement in Vienna.”

Lavrov said the negotiations were in the “home stretch” and suggested that last-minute Russian objections to the potential spillover of Ukraine-related sanctions into activities Moscow might undertake with Tehran under a new nuclear deal had been overcome.

He said the agreement under consideration would carve those activities out, something the U.S. has not denied and has said the Russians should have understood from the beginning.

“We would not sanction Russian participation in nuclear projects that are part of resuming full implementation of the (deal),” Price said. “We can’t and we won’t and we have not provided assurances beyond that to Russia.”

He said the U.S. would not allow Russia to flout Ukraine-related sanctions by funneling money or other assets through Iran. Any deal “is not going to be an escape hatch for the Russian Federation and the sanctions that have been imposed on it because of the war in Ukraine.”

Deal critics are skeptical that Russia won't at least try to evade Ukraine sanctions in dealings with Iran and have warned that potential sanctions-busting is just one reason they will oppose a new agreement.

Earlier this week, all but one of the 50 Republicans in the Senate signed a joint statement vowing to dismantle any agreement with Iran that has time limits on restrictions to advanced nuclear work, or that does not address other issues they have, including Iran's ballistic missile program and military support for proxies in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.

While the GOP won't be able to stop a deal now, it may have majorities in both houses of Congress after November's midterm elections. That would make it difficult for the administration to stay in any deal that is reached.

Another concern of deal critics is the scope of sanctions relief that the Biden administration is ready to provide Iran if it comes back into compliance with the deal. Iran has been demanding the removal of the Trump administration's designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a “foreign terrorist organization."

The U.S. has balked at that, barring Iranian commitments to stop funding and arming extremist groups in the region and beyond. The matter is of considerable interest in Washington, not least because the IRGC is believed to be behind specific and credible threats to former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Trump administration's Iran envoy Brian Hook.

Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) is considering strategic options for the future of Raiffeisenbank Russia over the military actions in Ukraine, including an exit from the Russian market, Chief Executive Officer Johann Strobl said on Thursday.

"This unprecedented situation leads RBI to consider its position in Russia. We are therefore assessing all strategic options for the future of, up to and including a carefully managed exit from Raiffeisenbank in Russia," he was quoted as saying.

"RBI and its subsidiary banks continue to operate in compliance with local and international sanction laws, changing financial market requirements, and in line with our Code of Conduct," the bank said in a statement. "RBI’s subsidiary banks are self-funded, well-capitalized, and have insignificant cross-border exposure to Russia," according to the statement.

Raiffeisen Bank, a subsidiary of one of the largest Austrian banking groups Raiffeisen Bank International AG, has been operating in Russia since 1996. Raiffeisen Bank is the tenth-biggest lender in terms of assets among Russian credit organizations.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on February 24 that he had made a decision to carry out a special military operation in Ukraine. The European Union slammed those actions as violation of international law and imposed corresponding sanctions.

March 17 (SeeNews) - Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International AG (VIE:RBI) on Thursday said it is assessing all strategic options for its business in Russia, including a carefully managed exit from the country.

RBI noted that its subsidiaries continue to operate in compliance with local and international sanction laws and are self-funded and well-capitalised. The subsidiaries have insignificant cross-border exposure to Russia, RBI added.

RBI's shares were trading 6.32% lower at EUR 13.48 on Thursday afternoon in Vienna, giving the bank a market value of EUR 4.43 billion (USD 4.87bn).

According to the head of the Austrian Institute of Economic Research, Wifo, RBI, with its investments in Russia as a percentage of total assets, is perhaps the most affected financial institution following western sanctions on Russia and may need protection. Speaking with TV channel Oe1 earlier this month, Gabriel Felbermayr said that RBI will be more affected by the western sanctions against the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the Swift payment system even than France's Societe Generale and Italy's Unicredit and a protective shield should be put in place in order to evade real problems at the Austrian bank.

(Vindobona) The Ukraine war could become the turning point for Austria's security policy. Parliamentary groups discussed Austria's position in the field of tension between neutrality, NATO accession and the EU army.

The Russian attack on Ukraine has shaken the world.

The war in Europe, which is causing inconceivable human suffering and seems to be far from over, also has enormous implications for the security architecture of the West.

Representatives of the five parliamentary groups represented in the Austrian parliament discussed this and the challenges it poses for Austrian neutrality. #CUT

Also present were Bernhard Gruber, Colonel of the General Staff Service, and Velina Tchakarova, Director of the AIEA Austria Institute for European and Security Policy.

What can or should Europe and Austria do?

Helmut Brandstätter, spokesman for foreign policy of the NEOS party, explained that Putin's plan had been observed for 20 years, but that the West had been blind. Putin had spent a lot of money in the last two decades with the aim to destroy the European society: Oligarchs had bought their way into Europe, Putin had partly re-nationalized the commodity industries, he had financed election campaigns of right-wing populist parties in Europe.

Michel Reimon, European spokesman for the Greens, also emphasized that it had long been possible to see what Putin was planning and in which direction he was going. Putin's script has existed for years, he said. In addition, Putin had tried to intervene deeply in national politics in Austria like nowhere else, and Austria must oppose this in its own interest, he said.

Petra Steger, EU spokesperson for the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ), expressly condemned Russia's attack on Ukraine, but stressed that in such a situation it was the task of politicians to act prudently. Under no circumstances should one pour oil on the fire, which would undoubtedly happen with the prospect of NATO membership for Ukraine or the enforcement of the no-fly zone demanded by Ukraine, the MEP said. In her opinion, Steger said, Austria must remain neutral in this situation.

Friedrich Ofenauer, defense spokesman for the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), added that Austria was, is and will remain neutral. However, February 24 represented a turning point, as a result of which Europe, but also Austria's energy, defense and security policy had to be rethought and realigned.

The EU must speak with one voice and be united. Putin will lose the war, at least politically, Robert Laimer, defense spokesman of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ), was convinced. For the EU, which has enormous economic power, this war could lead to new political strength; we just have to continue to pull together. At the same time, Laimer said, it was important to remain level-headed.

In his assessment of the situation, Bernhard Gruber, a colonel in the General Staff Service, said it was difficult, if not impossible, to say how the war would end and how a way out of the spiral of escalation could be found. It is clear that even after the end of the war, it will not be possible to go back to business as usual. Since a capitulation of Ukraine is not foreseeable, it can be assumed that the warlike actions could turn into a kind of guerrilla warfare in the long run, which could last for a long time and remain no less lossy, Gruber said.

Modern design of Austrian neutrality necessary

The question is not whether one is for or against neutrality, Brandstätter stressed, but what Austria is doing for the security of the people who live here. Long before the war in Ukraine, the threat scenarios included hybrid threats such as hacker attacks that could result in a large-scale blackout. The answer to this could only be a joint European approach, he said: Since Austria cannot defend itself alone, it must act against it within the framework of the EU, he said. That is why the Common Security and Defense Policy must be further promoted and expanded, said the MEP.

Steger pointed out the high value placed on neutrality by the Austrian population and criticized the fact that it has nevertheless been undermined for years, especially as a result of Austria's move towards the EU. Asked about his position with regard to neutrality, Ofenauer stressed that this had served Austria well and would continue to do so in the future. When thinking about the future of neutrality, one has to include military as well as civil and spiritual national defense, he pointed out.

Reimon was convinced that Austria's neutrality had to be "modern and offensive". Austria must seek a foreign policy role that corresponds to the new conditions. This could only happen within a European foreign policy in which the neutral EU member states could possibly play a special role. Austria would have to push forward confidently and actively contribute its experience. This would immediately invalidate the argument that Austria, which is surrounded by NATO states, is merely a free rider.

Due to the events in Ukraine, neutral states such as Sweden or Finland have so far shown interest in joining NATO. However, this is mainly due to the fact that these countries currently feel a different threat than Austria with its special geostrategic location in the middle of Europe, surrounded by NATO members, explained expert Gruber. Austria is non-aligned, he said, and therefore it is all the more important for the Austrian Armed Forces to cover a broad spectrum of capabilities. The danger facing Austria is not so much a classic attack by an army, but rather threats such as cyberattacks, blackouts or drone attacks, stressed Gruber, who considered the Austrian Armed Forces to be fundamentally well positioned, but said they needed to catch up in terms of defense against cybercrime, in the air sector and in digitalization.

Destabilization of Ukraine as destabilization of the European Union

Putin is not only waging war against the independent state of Ukraine, but also against the Ukrainian population, explained Velina Tchakarova, Director of the Austria Institute for European and Security Policy. This comprehensive war, according to expert Tchakarova, is intended to break the Ukrainian population and deprive it of its ability to resist. This has already driven an extremely high number of people to flee, which poses great challenges for the surrounding states as well as the EU, she said. However, Tchakarova was convinced that European solidarity would not diminish, but would continue to increase.

In this context, Steger stressed that first and foremost the refugees, among whom were mainly women and children, had to be helped. Many of them are fleeing to Europe to wait out the crisis and then return to their home countries. It is necessary to support them quickly.

EU unity as Putin's "success"?

Asked how long the EU's unity would last, Tchakarova replied that the war could well become a test of Europe's strength again. One must be aware that despite the united stance, lines of conflict still exist within the member states, Tchakarova said. As an example, the political analyst cited Hungary's position with regard to Russian gas exports and Poland's proposal to deploy a UN peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. In addition, there are many external actors in this area of tension - including the United States, China and Turkey - who are pursuing their own geopolitical interests and playing them off against each other. This naturally gives rise to security threats, Tchakarova noted, which are "mercilessly exploited" by these states - whether partners or rivals of the EU.

Therefore, Laimer said, one must proceed sensitively in the current situation. One must prevent Russia from increasingly orienting itself in the direction of China and ultimately "affiliating" itself, he said. It is important to keep in mind that Russia is part of Europe and that Russia should not be lost. Laimer pointed out Europe's mistakes and stressed that this balancing act had to be mastered despite all adversities and that this turning point had to be faced honestly.

It is also important to take a stand with regard to the events in the immediate vicinity, Brandstätter said: Austria can only be on one side of the issue of liberal democracy versus dictatorship and this must be made clear to Orbán, Vučić and all others.

This systemic struggle is currently taking place and Europe as a liberal democracy must be strong in order to win it. Europe has an incredible power and strength in its diversity, he said. Ofenauer. But it also contains a number of fault lines that are being exploited by various forces. The European Union must act in this difficult situation, and Austria is particularly called upon to raise awareness of where the fault lines lie.

The Ukraine war as the trigger for a change of era in energy polic

Austria must "get out as quickly as possible" of its dependence on Russian gas, said Reimon. Any sanction, in order to be sustainable in the long term, would have to hurt Putin more than the EU - this is how the position of the Green parties at the European level can be outlined. The search for alternatives is painful and difficult at the moment, especially when one has to turn to Saudi Arabia, for example, where 81 people were recently executed, Reimon said.

Ofenauer cited energy self-sufficiency as a major goal for the future. However, he said, the issue is highly complex, as an immediate switch to sustainable energy production is only feasible to a limited extent, as one has to resort to raw materials from other countries, which may not be ethically acceptable, in all areas.

Steger criticized that the EU had made many strategic mistakes in the past, which had led to dependence on other countries in many areas. From this point of view, the EU should rather focus on becoming more independent from other states, but this should not mean cutting trade relations with Russia, he said. Russia is geographically a part of Europe, and for this reason alone one must work on improving these relations in the future, said the MEP.

Robert Laimer concluded by stressing the importance of developing renewable energy sources, but also pointed out that we are not yet ready to "break away" from fossil fuels. He said that the EU must take a broader stance on energy supplies and organize them better, i.e. differently.

The Chancellor has to do "more of what he's already done" in his spring statement in order to help low-income families, Conservative mayor of the West Midlands Andy Street has said.

Mr Street told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Rishi Sunak had already acted "decisively" but that rising inflation would be "impacting far more on those on lower income levels because they spend more of their income" on fuel, energy, and food.

"I would hope that he will actually say for October, when the next price cap comes, there will be a further move and I hope it will be targeted, particularly through the Warm Homes Discount, so we really can think about those people who we have tended to call the 'just about managings', of whom there are many more in places like this than the affluent areas," he said.

He added: "One other thing I hope he will do is this is really about that group who want to manage, want to look after their own finances, the decision not to increase the thresholds around income tax and national insurance.

"I hope he will actually reconsider that because one of the ways we can put money directly into the hands of those who need it is move those thresholds forward."

Mark Harper, Tory MP for the Forest of Dean, said the Chancellor faces a "very difficult and challenging backdrop" for his spring statement after new figures show inflation increased to 6.2% in February.

Speaking to Sky News, Mr Harper, who helped to lead a rebellion of the Government over Covid restrictions in December, said: "I obviously have had some differences with the Government over the last couple of years about how it's handled the Covid pandemic."

The MP added that his actions have contributed to the Government "holding their nerve" and helped the economy to bounce back.

He said: "We've got the economy firing on all cylinders, and thank goodness we did, because it was only a few hours between getting all of those restrictions lifted and then we saw the appalling Russian invasion of Ukraine.

"We've gone from one crisis straight into another, which provides obviously a very difficult and challenging backdrop for the Chancellor as he sets out his spring statement later today."

Tory MP Mark Harper said he is "confident" the Chancellor will get the balancing act right as he delivers his spring statement later on Wednesday.

Asked if inflation could rise to double figures, Mr Harper told Sky News: "I think what is certain is that, actually, the economic picture is very uncertain because of what's happening in Europe with the Ukrainian situation.

"I think anyone who thinks now they can forecast what (will be) going on in the autumn, I think is likely to be wrong.

"I think what it does illustrate is the Chancellor has got competing pressures today.

"He understands the situation facing consumers and businesses but he also needs to make sure that that inflation outlook - the fact that the interest rate pressures that are going upwards and debt interest is higher - and he also needs to build in some resilience to deal with whatever the future may throw at us.

"So, those challenges, I think we're all competing, and provide a difficult balancing act for today, and I think that's the judgment that I'm confident he will get right when he said sets out his statement at lunchtime."

A Tory MP has said so-called partygate "hasn't gone away" but it is "for another day" as the Chancellor prepares to set out his spring statement.

Speaking to Sky News, Mark Harper said: "I've been very clear on the issues around how Downing Street have dealt with the so-called partygate.

"The Prime Minister wants us to judge him on the facts.

"I said I'll wait for the conclusion of the Metropolitan Police criminal investigation, which is ongoing, and the full Sue Gray report when she completes that and that's published, but that's a judgment, I think, for another day.

"We've obviously got this important Ukraine situation ongoing and the Government's obviously doing a good job on leading opinion on that, and then we've got the very important spring statement today.

"So, partygate hasn't gone away but it's not for today, it's for a day in the future when the Met's finished its inquiry and the Sue Gray report is published."

Tory MP Mark Harper has defended a hike in national insurance as a way to put money into the NHS and social care.

He told Sky News: "I can't comment on the specifics of what was going to be announced today, but I think on the national insurance rise, it's very clear - we've said we're going to put an extra £12 billion into, first of all, into the health service for backlogs that have arisen because of the pandemic, and then a long-term funding settlement for social care.

"If you're going to say you're against the national insurance rise taking place either this year or in the future, you've got to say whether you're prepared to not put that money into the health service or social care, or come up with some other way to pay for it."

Asked about tens of billions of extra revenue sitting in the exchequer as money Rishi Sunak could use, Mr Harper said: "Well, I think one of the problems is everyone's looking at the upside points, and there may well be - I haven't seen the forecast - there may well be extra revenue, but I think people are forgetting there are also extra costs.

"So, there are cost pressures on public services and, also, we've obviously had to borrow a very significant amount of money, rightly in my opinion, to deal with the economic impact of the pandemic, but that means the economy is vulnerable to rising interest rates and inflation, and, we saw yesterday, in very significant debt interest payments.

"The Chancellor has to be mindful of that when he's making decisions."

Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he agrees with Conservative MP Mark Harper's comments that if you scrap the national insurance hike, you have to replace it with something else.

Speaking on Sky News, he said: "I think he's made a valid point.

"I would like the national insurance rise scrapped, but you have to say where else you can find the money."

He went on to suggest that wealth should be taxed at the same rate as income tax.

"What you can do is basically tax wealth at the same rate as you tax income - so in other words, tax capital gains tax at the same rate as income tax, and that would bring in the estimated £17 billion, so, actually, it would be ideally suited to cover the amount that the Chancellor would want to raise.

"Now, this could be the way in which you have a fairer taxation system. Well, the first step towards (one) anyway."

Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the Government must "protect people" and "inflation-proof" those who will be hit the hardest by the cost-of-living crisis.

Speaking to Sky News, he said: "I think the most important thing for me is, you've got to protect people.

"You've got to inflation-proof, first of all, those people who are going to be hit the hardest in the coming months, and those are people on pensions and benefits, but also the low-paid as well, and therefore you've got to inflation-proof increases in pay as well."

Mr McDonnell also said he wants to see measures to "control" prices, including rent freezes and transport fare controls, to "protect people's incomes" and "reduce an element of the cost that's falling upon them".

He also said: "We need to go for green growth and the first step on green growth in the way in which we can help people with their energy bills is insulation.

"I think that's the sort of package I'd like to see today and I think we've got to recognise how tough it is for people out there and therefore they need assistance - now," he added.

Tony Danker, director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said the economy needs a "spring in its step".

Speaking to Sky News about Chancellor Rishi Sunak's upcoming spring statement, Mr Danker added: "What we need the Chancellor to do today is to shore up confidence in the economy to make sure we keep growing, because if we don't, these problems just get worse."

Mr Danker added that in the current climate: "There's a risk that confidence wavers, businesses stop investing, consumers stay at home - so inflation is hard to tackle.

"If we don't have tailwinds in our economy, then the headwinds overwhelm us and so the Chancellor has to double down on growth, he has to help hardest-hit households with the cost of living, he has to help lots of businesses who are dealing already with the rising energy costs - there isn't a price cap - and he needs to encourage businesses to be confident and invest and grow.

"That's the only way we really get through the year ahead."

Tony Danker, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said Rishi Sunak is likely to stick with the national insurance hike, but he needs to have "measures in place" to mitigate the negative impacts.

Mr Danker told Sky News: "Let's be honest, I think he's going to stick with it and if he does, then it just makes it even more important that he has measure in place to counter the downside effects of it."

He said this includes measures to help people "cope with the cost of living" and to encourage businesses and firms to invest and grow.

"He has to send a signal that now is the time to invest, now is the time to grow - we need that more than ever given the year were facing ahead."

Mr Danker added: "I think it would be very high-risk for the Chancellor to not take action today to help those hardest hit in our economy and to help stimulate growth."

Tony Danker told Sky News that despite the economic landscape, there are "still a lot of growth opportunities".

The CBI chief said: "Demand in the economy has been very high and there are still a lot of growth opportunities despite everything that's around us.

"But confidence is a fragile thing and confidence is what is the elephant in the room at the despatch box today.

"So I'd say to the Chancellor: double down on British confidence, double down on economic growth, show everybody that you, the Government, alongside we in business, want to tackle the headwinds you describe with real opportunity and growth.

"It's the only way to deal in the long run with cost of living, rising inflation and rising energy prices."

Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News that people are "suffering", and borrowing in the short term to invest may be a way to protect them.

Speaking on Sky News, he said: "The responsible way forward is to recognise that in times like this, there's real hardship out there. People are suffering.

"It is true - people choosing between heating and eating. We're talking about people who've had their wages frozen for nearly 12 years. It's tough out there.

"So yes, we've got to protect people in the short term and that does mean an increase in borrowing in the short term.

"But the most important thing is ... you borrow to invest, and that's why investment in alternative energy sources in insulating our homes is the right thing to do at the moment because you'll reap such huge rewards and obviously in terms of energy and alternative energy sources and insulation, you'll reap them pretty quick, as well."

The managing director of the Iceland supermarket chain has said his company is doing "everything we can" to support customers as prices rise.

Richard Walker told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that his stores were "in the poorest communities around the UK, so our customers are depending on us for that value".

But he said: "The pressure is relentless and it's coming at us from all angles at the moment."

Mr Walker said prices had increased in the supply chain, with shortages of workers and higher transportation costs to blame.

Meanwhile, shortages of fertiliser from Russia or sunflower oil from Ukraine were also factors.

He said: "And then finally we have operational cost pressures as well in the running of our shops.

"National minimum wage will increase our cost base by 20 million quid. We have green taxation of £16 million next year, and we have, of course, electricity bills which are going to rise many times over, and that will disproportionately affect bricks and mortar retailers, such as ourselves."

Richard Walker said food bank users were saying no to potatoes and root vegetables because they could not afford the energy to boil them.

The managing director of Iceland told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Chancellor would be right to focus on the consumer in his spring statement on Wednesday.

He said: "I think the cost-of-living crisis is the single most important domestic issue that we're facing as a country and it is incredibly concerning.

"You know, we're hearing about some food bank users declining potatoes and root veg because they can't afford the energy to boil them."

But he added that business was "not an endless sponge that can soak it all up".

Mr Walker suggested energy price caps for consumers could be extended to businesses, potentially paid for by a windfall tax, a cut in VAT, or even placing green taxes on hold.

Pat McFadden, shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said the Tories' reasons for hiking taxes now is so that they can cut them just before the next election.

Speaking to Sky News, he said Labour's proposal for a windfall levy on oil and gas companies would be "a real help this year".

"We've said a better place for the Chancellor to raise revenue right now would be a windfall levy on the oil and gas companies that are making the most from the current situation.

"The chief executive of BP described the current energy market as a cash machine for his company," he added.

"We hear a lot about the tax increases in April being necessary for public services, but at the same time, the Treasury is constantly briefing Tory MPs that the reason these tax rises have to happen now is so that the Tories can cut taxes before the next election.

"That is cynical timing and it means that the tax rises are not actually governed by an economic imperative, but by the Tory party's election grid, and that's not a good reason to pile on payments for families now."

Fuel prices have hit new record highs.

Figures from data firm Experian Catalist show the average cost of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts on Tuesday was 167.3p.

The average cost of a litre of diesel was 179.7p.

This comes amid speculation Chancellor Rishi Sunak could announce a temporary cut in fuel duty of up to 5p per litre in Wednesday's spring statement.

Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said "Labour will get our economy firing on all cylinders" as she prepared to respond to Rishi Sunak's spring statement.

"With our plans to buy, make and sell more in Britain and our climate investment pledge, we will create a stronger economy," she said.

Ms Reeves posted a picture on social media showing her preparing for her appearance in the Commons with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and shadow Treasury chief secretary Pat McFadden.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak has admitted the financial outlook is "challenging" because of soaring inflation and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Downing Street has said.

No 10 said he provided an update on the economic situation to ministers during Wednesday morning's Cabinet meeting.

A statement read: "The Chancellor provided an update on the economic and fiscal picture, and described the outlook as challenging given the global shocks we are facing as a result of the conflict in Ukraine and rising inflation.

"He said that throughout the pandemic, the Government has shown the British people we are on their side and we will continue to stand by them through the uncertainty that we now face.

"He described how the sensible management of the public finances enabled the Government to step in and help people with £9 billion of support for their energy bills in February.

"He said that this Government would continue to take a responsible and sustainable approach in order to be able to grow a stronger, more secure economy for the future."

Chancellor Rishi Sunak started by referencing Ukraine, telling the House of Commons: "The sorrow we feel for their suffering, and admiration for their bravery, is only matched by the gratitude we feel for the security in which we live. And what underpins that security is the strength of our economy."

Mr Sunak added: "We should be in no doubt, behind Putin's invasion is a dangerous calculation: That democracies are divided, politically weak, and economically insecure; incapable of making tough long-term decisions to strengthen our economies.

"This calculation is mistaken."

Rishi Sunak told MPs: "Today's statement builds a stronger, more secure economy for the United Kingdom.

"We have a moral responsibility to use our economic strength to support Ukraine and, working with international partners, to impose severe costs on Putin's regime."

He went on to list sanctions already imposed.

Rishi Sunak said the UK's actions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime are "not cost-free for us at home" and present a "risk" to the recovery.

He said the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has recognised there is an "unusually high uncertainty around the outlook", adding: "It is too early to know the full impact of the Ukraine war on the UK economy.

"But their initial view, combined with high global inflation and continuing supply chain pressures, means the OBR now forecast growth this year of 3.8%.

"The OBR then expect the economy to grow by 1.8% in 2023, and 2.1%, 1.8% and 1.7% in the following three years."

Mr Sunak said the lower growth outlook has not affected the country's "strong jobs performance".

Rishi Sunak said the UK Government wanted people to know they will "stand by them" in dealing with rising living costs, telling MPs: "Today I can announce that for only the second time in 20 years, fuel duty will be cut.

"Not by one, not even by two, but by 5p per litre. The biggest cut to all fuel duty rates - ever.

"While some have called for the cut to last until August, I have decided it will be in place until March next year - a full 12 months. Together with the freeze, it's a tax cut this year for hard-working families and businesses worth over £5 billion, and it will take effect from 6pm tonight."

Rishi Sunak announced VAT will be reduced from 5% to zero on materials such as solar panels, heat pumps and insulation in a bid to help homeowners install more energy saving materials.

He said: "We'll also reverse the EU's decision to take wind and water turbines out of scope - and zero rate them as well. And we'll abolish all the red tape imposed by the EU. A family having a solar panel installed will see tax savings worth over £1,000. And savings on their energy bill of over £300 per year."

Mr Sunak said the policy will not apply immediately to Northern Ireland due to "deficiencies" in the Northern Ireland Protocol but said support would be offered.

The Chancellor also said he is doubling the Household Support Fund to £1 billion, with local authorities best placed to help those in need in their areas, adding they will receive this funding from April.

Rishi Sunak said underlying debt is expected to fall steadily from 83.5% of GDP in 2022/23 to 79.8% in 2026/27.

He added borrowing as a percentage of GDP is 5.4% this year, 3.9% next year, then 1.9%, 1.3%, 1.2% and 1.1% in the following years.

Mr Sunak told MPs: "The OBR has not accounted for the full impacts of the war in Ukraine and we should be prepared for the economy and public finances to worsen - potentially significantly. And the cost of borrowing is continuing to rise.

"In the next financial year, we're forecast to spend £83 billion on debt interest - the highest on record. And almost four times the amount we spent last year."

Mr Sunak said that is why he will continue to "weigh carefully" calls for additional public spending.

Rishi Sunak told MPs he would publish a "tax plan" in which he wanted to reduce and reform taxes over the Parliament, and insisted the health and care levy will stay.

He said: "But a long-term funding solution for the NHS and social care is not incompatible with reducing taxes on working families."

He went on: "Our current plan is to increase the NICs threshold this year by £300, I'm not going to do that - I'm going to increase it by the full £3,000, delivering our promise to fully equalise the NICs and income tax thresholds.

"And not incrementally over many years, but in one go, this year. From this July, people will be able to earn £12,570 a year without paying a single penny of income tax or National Insurance.

"That is a £6 billion tax cut for 30 million people across the UK. A tax cut for employees worth over £330 a year. The largest increase in a basic rate threshold ever. And the largest single personal tax cut in a decade."

Rishi Sunak said he wanted to reform R&D tax credits, telling MPs: "We'll expand the generosity of the reliefs to include data, cloud computing and pure maths. And we'll consider, in the autumn, whether to make the R&D expenditure credit more generous."

The Chancellor said he also wants to cut the tax rates on business investment in his next Budget, adding: "People, capital, ideas - three priorities for business tax cuts this autumn."

Rishi Sunak said he would go further to help small businesses reduce their tax bills and make it cheaper to employ staff.

He told MPs: "From April, the employment allowance will increase to £5,000. That's a new tax cut worth up to £1,000 for half a million small businesses - starting in just two weeks' time.

Rishi Sunak announced his intention to cut the basic rate of income tax before the end of the current Parliament in 2024.

He told MPs: "A clear goal for Conservative chancellors, and even some Labour ones, has been to cut income tax. The fact this has only happened twice in 20 years tells you how hard it is to do.

"Covid and the war in Ukraine have only added to the difficulty of achieving this by the end of this Parliament."

Mr Sunak added: "It would clearly be irresponsible to meet this ambition this year - and yet I refuse to let that ambition wither and drift. By 2024, the OBR currently expects inflation to be back under control, debt falling sustainably, and the economy growing. Our fiscal rules are met with a clear safety margin.

"So, my final announcement today is this: I can confirm, before the end of this Parliament, in 2024, for the first time in 16 years, the basic rate of income tax will be cut from 20 to 19p in the pound.

"A tax cut for workers, for pensioners, for savers. A £5 billion tax cut for 30 million people. It is fully costed and fully paid for in the plan announced today."

Rishi Sunak ended by telling MPs: "My tax plan delivers the biggest net cut to personal taxes in over a quarter of a century."

Responding to Rishi Sunak's statement, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said the £3,000 increase to the national insurance threshold would "more than compensate about 70% of workers".

Posting on Twitter, he voiced doubts the 5p off fuel duty would be in place for a year only, adding: "It hasn't managed to increase even in line with inflation for more than a decade."

"And 5p not huge in context of prices up 20p+ per litre," he tweeted.

Mr Johnson said it was "unsurprising" growth forecasts have been downgraded and that an average inflation of 7% implies it could peak at "around 9%".

In another tweet, he added: "If £0.5bn is all there is for poorest families paid through local authorities, that will be hugely disappointing.

"Doesn't look like benefits being raised."

The Chancellor's choices are making the cost-of-living crisis worse, not better, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has said.

Responding to Rishi Sunak's spring statement, Ms Reeves told the Commons: "Today was the day that the Chancellor could have put a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to provide real help to families, but he didn't.

"Today was the day the Chancellor could have set out a proper plan to support businesses and create good jobs. But he didn't.

"Today was the day he could have properly scrapped his national insurance hike, he didn't.

"We said it was the wrong tax at the wrong time, the wrong choice. Today, the Chancellor has finally admitted he got that one wrong.

"Inflation is at its highest level for 30 years and rising. Energy prices at record highs. People are worried sick.

"For all his words, it is clear that the Chancellor does not understand the scale of the challenge. He talks about providing security for working families, but his choices are making the cost-of-living crisis worse, not better."

IFS director Paul Johnson tweeted: "The big omission from this statement was anything for those subsisting on means-tested benefits.

"They will be facing cost-of-living increases of probably 10% but their benefits will rise by just 3.1%.

"And (it is a) cut compared to last year if you account for withdrawal of £20 (Universal Credit) uplift."

Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the Government's plan did nothing for people on the edge of fuel poverty or for pensioners who are facing a "real-terms cut" to their income.

Rachel Reeves told the Commons: "At the weekend the Chancellor was asked about fuel poverty and he didn't even know the numbers.

"It is shameful that he doesn't, because when Martin Lewis predicts that 10 million people could be pushed into fuel poverty the Chancellor should sit up and listen."

She added: "We know that pensions and social security are not going to keep up with inflation. Pensioners and those on social security are being given a real-terms cut in their incomes.

"So, what analysis has the Chancellor done of the impact of benefits being up-rated by less than inflation? How many more children and pensioners will drift into poverty because of ... this Government?"

It is "deeply regrettable" that the SNP agrees with the Government on shielding oil and gas companies from a windfall tax, Rachel Reeves added.

The shadow chancellor said: "Who does the Chancellor prioritise? He continues to defend the record profits of oil and gas producers who themselves admit that they have more money than they know what to do with.

"BP describes this crisis as a cash machine. But it is British people who are paying out."

She added it was "deeply regrettable that the SNP have joined the Tories in wanting to shield oil and gas producers" from Labour's proposed windfall tax on their profits.

Labour shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said increasing energy prices would mean Labour's plan for a windfall tax on energy companies' profits would raise twice as much as when it was proposed in January, which could be used to cut VAT and provide a targeted warms home discount.

She told the Commons: "When I set out Labour's plans for a windfall tax in January we estimated that it would have raised £1.2 billion, now because of the continued rise in global oil and gas prices it would today raise over £3 billion.

"That's money that could be used to help families and pensioners and businesses with a cut to VAT, a real Brexit dividend that would help working families and pensioners across our country, and a targeted warms home discount that would see families and pensioners on the lowest and modest incomes being supported by £600."

Labour also criticised the Chancellor's decision to "sign off" on a reduction in the size of the army and called on the Government to confirm whether this was still its plan.

Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: "The situation following Putin's criminal assault on Ukraine remains gravely serious.

"Just one month after the invasion so much has changed with repercussions for years to come, but the Chancellor has failed today to explain why he chose to sign off on a reduction in our armed forces last October.

"Will the Chancellor confirm if the Government's target army size is still being reduced by 10,0000 troops?"

Labour shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said "despite the Chancellor's reluctant measures the facts are that he is still taking money out of people's purses and wallets with an increase in national insurance contributions".

She said: "Today the Chancellor comes along after 12 years of failure on energy efficiency and announces a VAT cut on building materials. This is wholly inadequate. A proper energy efficiency scheme like the one we have set out could cut bills by £400 to people from next year.

"The silence from the Chancellor on our energy intensive manufacturing industries is appalling. At this time of national crisis, people and businesses need a Government that is on their side."

On national insurance, she said: "Despite the Chancellor's reluctant measures, the facts are that he is still taking money out of people's purses and wallets with an increase in national insurance contributions.

"The changes that he is making today begs the question, why did he embark on these changes in the first place, despite the warnings from the Labour party and from many many others."

Rachel Reeves accused the Chancellor of delivering "increasingly incredible claims", telling MPs: "Perhaps the Chancellor has been taking inspiration from the characters of Alice in Wonderland - or should I say Alice in Sunak-land, because nothing here is quite as it seems either.

"It's the sort of place where a Chancellor celebrates giving people £200 to help them with their spiralling energy bills before explaining he needs it all back.

"In Sunak-land, the Chancellor claims 'I believe in lower taxes' while at the same time as hiking Alice's national insurance contributions. So Alice asks the Chancellor 'when did lower taxes mean higher taxes, has down really become the new up?'.

"The Chancellor follows Humpty Dumpty's advice and says 'when I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less'.

"Alice knows that under the Conservatives taxes are at their highest level in decades as a result of the policies of this very same Chancellor. In fact, this Chancellor is the only G7 finance minister to raise taxes on working people during this crucial year of recovery. Curiouser and curiouser.

"As Alice climbs out of the rabbit hole to leave Sunak-land, she recalls the words of the white rabbit and concludes that perhaps the Chancellor's reality is just different from yours."

The chair of the all-party environment group has welcomed Rishi Sunak's plan to cut VAT on energy efficiency measures.

Conservative MP Anthony Browne said: "As energy bills rise, it was welcome to see the Chancellor recognise the important role energy efficiency can play by cutting VAT on energy saving materials such as solar panels, insulation and heat pumps to 0%.

"Measures like this can help reduce dependence on expensive gas and I look forward to further announcements on energy efficiency as part of the PM's energy strategy."

Labour shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said "the Chancellor has made the wrong choices," accusing him of "helping out" those "swindling" the taxpayer.

She said: "For all his tax rising on millions in the middle, where is the increased tax contribution for the very wealthiest in society?"

She added "the Chancellor has made the wrong choices," adding the "people powering our economy" will be paying more in taxes.

Ms Reeves said: "Who has the Chancellor been helping out? Those who have been swindling the taxpayer. The Chancellor left open the vaults for widespread waste, crony contracts, and a frenzy of fraud."

She mentioned money spent on unused PPE and "£3.5 billion worth of contracts awarded to friends, donors and pub landlords".

Rachel Reeves, after her "Sunak-land" story, told MPs: "The actual reality is that this Chancellor's failure to back a windfall tax and his stubborn desire to pursue a national insurance tax rise are the wrong choices.

"In eight days, people's energy bills will be rising by 54%, two weeks today the Chancellor's tax hike will start hitting working people and their employers.

"His national insurance tax rise was a bad idea last September and he's admitted it's an even worse one today.

"The Chancellor is making an historic mistake. Today was the day to scrap the tax rise on jobs, today was the day to bring forward a windfall tax, today was the day for the Chancellor to set out a plan to support British businesses.

"But, on the basis of the statement today and the misguided choices of this Chancellor, families and businesses will from now on endure significant hardship as a result.

"The Chancellor has failed to appreciate the scale of the challenge that we face and yet again he's making the wrong choices for our country."

Rishi Sunak told the shadow chancellor that her statement sounded as if Covid "had never actually happened".

Responding to Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor said: "Listening to her statement, it did sound as if Covid and the huge damage that it had done to our economy and public finances had never actually happened. It sounded as if we didn't need to do things like furlough or support businesses and provide emergency funding to schools, to councils, the NHS.

"Because whilst her party supported all of those policies at the time, they now seem unwilling to pay for them. There is a pattern there, they're always happy to spend taxpayers' money, just not take care of it."

On Labour's calls for a windfall tax on gas and oil companies, Mr Sunak said: "We know on this side of the House, we want to encourage more investment in the North Sea.

"We want more domestic energy, we want more jobs for the UK and a windfall tax would put that off, which is why the Prime Minister will be bringing forward a comprehensive energy security strategy in the coming weeks to address that."

Labour shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves called for the National Crime Agency to investigate fraud, saying the Chancellor had the "audacity" to ask taxpayers to fill a "blackhole" when £11.8 billion of public money has been lost to fraud.

She said: "The Chancellor has been signing cheques to fraudsters, including organised criminals and drug dealers."

She said the Chancellor "has lost a staggering £11.8 billion of public money to fraud".

She said: "As a result of, lets face it, this jaw-dropping incompetence, the Conservatives have been funding crime instead of fighting it.

"Now the Chancellor has the audacity to come to British taxpayers asking them to pay more to fill his blackhole."

She said "let's call in the National Crime Agency to investigate", adding "taxpayers want their money back".

Rishi Sunak has said that as a result of the increase in national insurance thresholds, 70% of workers will pay less tax, even accounting for the levy.

Responding to Rachel Reeves' comments on tax, the Chancellor told the Commons: "The increase in national insurance thresholds to fully equalise them is a £6 billion tax cut for 30 million UK workers.

"It is the largest increase in thresholds ever, the biggest personal tax cut in a decade and it is worth £330 for those workers and it means, and this is the part that I don't know if she has realised because she talked about the levy and making sure that we direct our policy at those who need our help, there's a reason the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies called this the best way to help low and middle earners through the tax system.

"That is because 70% of workers will pay less tax, even accounting for the levy.

"It is more generous than the policy she is advocating and combined with the other tax cuts we have announced today, as I said, this plan represents the biggest cut, the biggest net cut to personal taxes in a quarter of a century."

Mr Sunak concluded: "Now, no Government gets every call right, we learn from our mistakes, we strive to improve. But even if they won't admit it, members opposite will recognise this day as an achievement which we all can celebrate.

"I've said it before to the party opposite, and I'll say it again: there is a fine line between reasonable criticism and political opportunism, and in my experience the British people can always tell the difference."

The SNP was branded "pathetic" for asking whether the Chancellor was aware of how heating pre-payment meters work.

SNP Treasury spokeswoman Alison Thewliss: "I don't know if the Chancellor has ever had a pre-payment meter. I don't think they fit them for swimming pools, but four and a half million people across these islands..."

Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey could be heard shouting that the remark was "pathetic".

Ms Thewliss continued: "She says it is pathetic but four and a half million people across these islands are experiencing the stress and the fear of watching the money run out from their pre-payment meters.

"Pre-payment customers already pay higher bills than those in direct debit and they are struggling to access the Chancellor's 'heat now, pay later' loan, if it doesn't go automatically to pay back the debts on that meter."

Chancellor Rishi Sunak replied: "On pre-payment meters where she made a comment, I am acutely aware that millions of families rely on pre-payment meters, which is why when we designed the energy support package that we announced in February we had particular care to those families to make sure they would receive the same benefit, and indeed we found out and made sure that 40% of them will automatically get the £200 rebate in October."

Mr Sunak added work was taking place to ensure the rest "get the same benefit".

Tony Danker, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said: "The Chancellor has taken steps to sustain confidence in our economy. They are welcome but don't do enough to tackle the current challenges facing firms.

"His new plan to incentivise business investment from next year is very good news.

"We stand ready to work with the Chancellor on measures essential to transforming productivity such as capital allowances, R&D reforms and a revised apprenticeship levy. These measures lie at the heart of UK competitiveness.

"In reality, we cannot wait until October to get growth going. The Government needs to get moving straight away."

Mr Danker called for "concrete plans" on energy generation and infrastructure.

"The Chancellor is right that the Government can't solve every challenge.

"However, the only enduring response to inflation, energy prices and cost-of-living challenges is a relentless campaign for economic growth."

The Government has not done enough to help people in receipt of benefits, the SNP said.

SNP Treasury spokeswoman Alison Thewliss said: "Cutting Universal Credit (UC) by £20 a week at a time when people need it the most - a single mum spoke at a Gingerbread (a charity for single-parent households) reception on Monday and told us all how important it was that that money was there because things are tighter than they have ever been.

"No further support for people on legacy benefits and disabled people who often faced higher energy costs and have no option in those costs; a taper put in place that only helps people who are in work; benefits just not going far enough as they don't keep pace with inflation, and a welfare cap that punishes people for their circumstances."

Ms Thewliss had earlier said the Chancellor had "increased taxes more in two years than Gordon Brown did in No 10, while people are struggling".

Rishi Sunak replied: "I always want to make sure that we look after the most vulnerable in society. She mentioned a single mum who she knew.

"I am pleased and proud of the fact that because of the actions of this Government, increasing the national living wage in April by 6.6%, by cutting the UC taper rate, and indeed by the increase in personal thresholds today. Taken altogether, all tax and welfare changes, that single mother of two children working full-time on the national living wage will now be £1,600 better off."

DUP Treasury spokesperson Sammy Wilson said more could have been done to help ease the rising cost of living, and questioned the absence of additional defence spending.

He also said "the Chancellor cannot apply all of his taxes to Northern Ireland because of the Northern Ireland Protocol".

The MP for East Antrim said: "It would be churlish not to accept that the Chancellor has sought to deal with many of the issues that face working families today. But I believe that given the windfall in taxes which he has experienced that there could have been more done to help with fuel costs, energy bills, and other cost-of-living increases.

"It's significant that the Chancellor cannot apply all of his taxes to Northern Ireland because of the Northern Ireland Protocol, it shows it needs to be dealt with."

Mentioning Ukraine, Mr Wilson said: "Surprisingly there is nothing, and no mention, of additional resources for defence, the defence of this country, the defence of democracy, and the defence of the values in the face of Putin's aggression. Why is there an absence of this today?"

Rishi Sunak said: "The headrooms we have are actually relatively small by historical standards and could be wiped out very easily by small changes in the macroeconomic outlook, so I think it's wrong to say there is a huge windfall."

He added: "We increased the defence budget by £24 billion in 2020, the largest increase since the Cold War. It was the only department that got a four-year settlement."

Labour's shadow climate secretary Ed Miliband tweeted: "The rise in energy bills is a national emergency. Rishi Sunak thinks £200 of loans is the answer.

"He just doesn't get it. Millions face fuel poverty and the Chancellor shrugs his shoulders.

"We won't stop fighting for more support, including a windfall tax on oil and gas giants."

IFS director Paul Johnson tweeted: "No extra money for health, schools or other public services despite huge increase in inflation.

"Likely implies big real pay cuts for most public sector workers.

"E.g. (government) evidence to teacher review body asked for just 3% pay rise for most teachers as inflation averages over 7%."

Despite Chancellor Rishi Sunak announcing tax cuts, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says the tax burden will still hit the highest level since the 1940s.

The OBR says net tax rises plus the "more tax-rich composition" of forecasted economic activity raises the tax burden from 33% of GDP in 2019/20 to 36.3% in 2026/27.

Its fiscal outlook says this is the "highest level since the late 1940s", adding that this "is a 3.3% of GDP increase in the tax burden in the space of seven years".

Conservative MP Robert Halfon thanked the Chancellor for cutting fuel duty and increasing the national insurance thresholds, as he joked: "I hope I can retire from campaigning on this particular issue. My life would be a lot easier."

The MP for Harlow added: "He (Rishi Sunak) has stood up for workers and for people on low incomes and we should not forget that as he said it's this party that is the true workers' party of the United Kingdom.

"On the apprenticeship levy, when he looks at the reform, can he make sure that apprenticeships remain at the heart, that it focuses on getting more disadvantaged people to do apprentices, young people and people doing degree apprenticeships?"

Mr Sunak replied: "I can give him that reassurance. Apprenticeships are fantastic. We want to make sure they're continually supported. But we will look at all aspects to make sure that we're also incentivising the training that we want to see."

Conservative former Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick also praised the measures announced in the spring statement, as he said: "I think when the Chancellor gets back to his office, that portrait of Nigel Lawson will be looking admiringly on him. This is a Conservative plan that we can all get behind, it rewards work, it gets the deficit down and it actually incentivises investment by businesses rather than penalising them with windfall taxes."

Labour MP Alison McGovern said the "small print reveals that unemployment is forecast to rise next year".

The MP for Wirral South said: "Red alarms rang when the Chancellor of the Exchequer glossed over the employment numbers in his statement just now. But the small print reveals that unemployment is forecast to rise next year and then plateau."

She asked: "What are the Department for Work and Pensions playing at?"

Rishi Sunak said "unemployment is almost at a record low level at the moment of 3.9%", adding the forecasts are lower than in the October forecasts.

He said: "They all are continually still at very low levels at around 4.2ish throughout the forecast period. We are very proud of this Government's track record on jobs, record numbers of people on payroll, compared to the forecasts of millions of people unemployed, we managed to successfully get everyone back to work with a record number of job vacancies."

Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney (Richmond Park) asked why there was no "emergency cut" to VAT.

Reacting to the Chancellor's spring statement, Greg Parmley, chief executive of music industry group Live, said: "Live music is facing new and unprecedented challenges that threaten to wreck one of the UK's cultural crown jewels - a 7.5% increase in VAT on tickets, wholesale cost increases and major ticket cancellations due to spiking Covid cases.

"At the same time, the last remaining help from Government is being withdrawn.

"While we welcome the business rates discount, we need further measures that can provide a cash injection to all areas of the sector, such as action on VAT. We are calling on the Chancellor to look again at these measures, which would help secure the sector's recovery and allow our £4.5 billion industry to continue boosting the UK economy."

Green MP Caroline Lucas (Brighton, Pavilion) claimed "once again quite incredibly there is a climate-shaped hole at the heart of this statement".

She said: "Once again the Chancellor didn't even mention the word climate, which is all the more unforgiveable since the measures that we need to tackle the climate crisis and the cost-of-living crisis are the same.

"So with six million people now facing fuel poverty, can he tell us where is the home retrofit revolution and the investment that we need to make 90 million homes warmer by 2030, saving families £400 off their bills and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process? How many more people have to freeze in their homes before he'll act?"

Mr Sunak replied: "We already acted in the spending review last autumn to outline billions of pounds to improve the energy efficiency of hundreds of thousands of homes across the country... She I think missed the fact that we just cut VAT today on energy saving materials."

Rishi Sunak said a small amount of extra funding will be directed to improving access for people who cannot use standard accessible toilets.

The Chancellor's comments came as Labour MP Emma Hardy (Kingston upon Hull West) told the Commons about a message she had just received from a constituent, who is a carer for his disabled wife.

She explained: "He said 'so, no help for the disabled, I guess I'll have to put my wife into a hospital next winter, so she can stay warm'. What does the Chancellor want to say to him? Somebody who doesn't drive a car and isn't planning on installing solar panels on his rented home?"

Mr Sunak replied: "It's obviously hard to comment on individual circumstances, but in general I'm proud of this Government's support for those who are disabled. We spent something like £58 billion on disability welfare, when the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) do their comparisons, we ranked higher than many other countries including the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany and Austria when I last checked the figures.

"So, we are generous and compassionate in how we support those who are disabled. There is a range of things we're doing, not least spending a billion pounds to help people with disabilities into work, providing money, £1.5 billion for the disabilities facility grant to improve the conditions of their homes.

"And today, we announced a small amount of extra funding for an issue that I care passionately about and that is improving the provision of Changing Places toilets across the country. It will increase the number by 40%, making sure that the quarter of a million people with complex disabilities who need access to those facilities will now find one closer to where they need it."

Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner tweeted: "The Chancellor hasn't got a clue. He lives in another world.

"He's left households and businesses to fend for themselves in the middle of a devastating cost of living crisis.

"The Office for Budget Responsibility knows this is the biggest hit to household incomes on record."

Music Venue Trust chief executive Mark Davyd said the Chancellor's spring statement failed to address the "extraordinary financial pressures" faced by concert venues.

He said: "Music Venue Trust warmly welcomes the business rates discount, which will maintain the 50% business rates for grassroots music venues that the Government announced pre-pandemic.

"With no action for businesses on energy bills, NI liability and the missed opportunity of action on VAT that would support the sector to recover from the Covid crisis, the outcome of the budget is that none of the extraordinary financial pressures being placed on venues have been mitigated or alleviated.

"This budget has failed to respond to inflationary increases from rent, supplies, and services running in excess of 20% across the sector. The Government has recommitted itself to supporting business investment, especially research and development. We again ask that the Secretary of State for Culture should enter into meaningful discussions with the live music industry to create R&D tax incentives and direct financial support to achieve that outcome."

Conservative former minister Sir Edward Leigh asked if the Government would consider tax relief on the cost of minor operations if people have been waiting for a long time for the treatment on the NHS.

He told the Commons the economy is facing challenges from "at least two of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, death from plague and war".

Sir Edward said more and more pensioners are having to wait "a long time" for "so-called minor operations", and said more and more people are paying to go privately.

He asked if the Chancellor would have an "open mind" to providing "some sort of tax relief, if not on insurance, on the actual cost of the operation if it's delayed for say two years".

Rishi Sunak said he was "always happy to take suggestions" from Sir Edward, and outlined measures being taken to support the NHS.

Conservative MP Huw Merriman, chair of the Transport Committee, welcomed the temporary 5p cut to fuel duty, but said: "If it does become permanent, given it costs £5 billion, we will not be able to reduce income tax which also costs £5 billion, if we are also to meet our tests of fiscal responsibility."

Mr Sunak said: "We have fully accounted for the income tax cut in these plans, but it will require collective discipline to deliver those tax cuts and others."

Conservative Peter Aldous (Waveney) urged the Chancellor to "look very closely at the levels of and the means of uprating Universal Credit and other benefits".

He said: "The last two years have been very challenging for the poorest and most vulnerable and it is going to get a whole lot tougher. As we saw of his swift and right decision to raise Universal Credit at the start of the pandemic, which was too hastily reduced, the best way of targeting support for those who need it is through the benefits system.

"Can I urge (him) in the coming days and weeks to look very closely at the levels of and the means of uprating Universal Credit and other benefits?"

Mr Sunak replied: "I strongly believe the best way to help people sustainably is to move them off welfare and into work, that is what this Government is doing.

"Our record on doing so is incredibly strong and we are throwing literally the kitchen sink both in terms of money and policies, which the IMF has described as well targeted, to support people as they make that transition and put more money in their pockets."

Labour former minister Stephen Timms questioned the Chancellor's decision to increase the size of the Household Support Fund, instead of increasing benefits in line with inflation.

The chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee said: "The party opposite introduced Universal Credit, but instead of uprating it in line with current inflation, the Chancellor has chosen to increase the size of the Household Support Fund, which if you have heard of it, you have to go to the local council for.

"What evidence does he have, if any, that the Household Support Fund is effective in delivering help to those families who need help most?"

Rishi Sunak replied: "The feedback I get from colleagues is that it has been effective and I trust local councils to know in their area who the people are that most need our help."

He added: "But we didn't just do that. In the autumn Budget, we cut the tax rate on Universal Credit. A £2 billion tax cut for almost two million of those on the lowest incomes on Universal Credit."

Labour former shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned "lives will be put at risk" as he urged Rishi Sunak to "double the winter fuel allowance".

The MP for Hayes and Harlington said: "Can we be absolutely clear that benefits and pensions are still going to rise by only 3.1% whilst inflation is predicted to be between 7% and 10%, that's a cut for some of the poorest in our society."

He added: "The people I'm desperately worried about in my constituency are those who are forced to live on benefits, largely through disability and ill health, and poorer pensioners.

"We know the energy prices are rising rapidly, the assistance he's provided so far will not enable them to cope and I think when we get to November they will be freezing in their own homes and lives will be put at risk. One simple solution is to double the winter fuel allowance."

Mr Sunak replied: "The doubling in the size of the Household Support Fund is there for his local council and others to support those most in need.

"He's right to highlight the winter fuel payments, which are payments of up to £300 for those pensioners, and many of them, those on pension credit, will have access to the warm homes discount, which is an extra £150."

Sanctions need to be placed on the trust funds set up by Putin-linked oligarchs to protect their assets, ministers have heard.

Labour MP for the Rhondda Chris Bryant told the Commons: "We cannot possibly think that this is job yet done. Mariupol still burns, children are fleeing the bombing of their homes. We still haven't introduced a sanctions regime which is as tough as the sanctions regime on Iran.

"Can I urge him to go a bit further? We need to sanction all the Russian banks, not just 60% of them. We need to tackle the trust funds such as that recently set up by Alisher Usmanov so as to protect his assets in the UK. We need to tackle the families and the hangers-on, such as Lavrov's family who are in the UK, and we need to tackle shipping."

Chancellor Rishi Sunak replied: "I am highly confident that what we have done is world-leading, particularly with regards to acts on bankers. But we are constantly in dialogue with our partners to make sure the action that we take is effective."

As Mr Sunak used the phrase "world-leading", Mr Bryant could be heard to say: "Don't do that. Why do that? It is shameful when you do that."

The Chancellor added: "We are ahead of most of our peers and he doesn't know what I know because I am in the conversations with finance ministers about where else they are prepared to go."

Some 70% of workers will pay less in national insurance contributions because of the threshold rise, Rishi Sunak said.

Conservative MP for Dudley South Mike Wood asked: "Just what proportion of the poorest will now be getting more money from a higher threshold than they paid in the health and social care levy?"

The Chancellor said: "Seventy per cent of workers will pay less because of the increase in thresholds, even taking into account the new levy."

Liberal Democrat MP Tim Farron (Westmorland and Lonsdale) warned that farmers were leaving the industry due to difficulties with a transition from the European subsidies system to a new one after Brexit, and called on the Chancellor to tackle the issue.

He said: "As it stands we are seeing farmers leaving the industry just at the moment we are facing an international food security crisis."

Mr Sunak replied: "What I can say is that the overall funding for farming has been protected by this Government and the same level of funding is available as we promised it would be."

SNP MP Peter Grant asked for assurances that changes to research and development incentives will not "just become yet another taxpayer-funded get-rich-quick scheme".

He said: "The National Audit Office (NAO) have found that HMRC in a single year allowed over £300 million of fraudulent claims for research and development tax relief.

"We also know from other NAO reports that the Treasury are woefully bad at producing evidence to demonstrate that any of their tax relief policies actually deliver the required objectives."

Mr Grant asked what assurances could be given that the spring statement "is actually going to lead to a genuine real-terms increase in R&D spend, and won't just become yet another taxpayer-funded get-rich-quick scheme".

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: "Government spending on R&D is increasing considerably over this Parliament. But the honourable gentleman is right to point out some of the issues with our existing relief schemes. They don't work as well as they should. We are committed to tackling them. Final announcements made in the autumn for effect in spring."

Labour MP Rachael Maskell (York Central) called for an increase in social security payments, saying: "All my poorest constituents want is food, warmth and shelter, against soaring house prices, all they got was 6p a day from the housing support fund on average."

The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned workers face paying more tax on earnings in 2025 despite Chancellor Rishi Sunak's cuts in his spring statement.

Director Paul Johnson said: "If he wants to be remembered as a tax-reforming chancellor, so far he is headed in the wrong direction.

"The combination of increased NI rates and a reduced income tax rate will make the tax system both less equitable and less efficient."

The Institute for Fiscal Studies said Chancellor Rishi Sunak has failed to help the "very poorest" despite warnings of the biggest hit to living standards since the 1950s.

After the spring statement, IFS director Paul Johnson said that "what really stands out today is what's missing".

"In the face of what the OBR calls the biggest hit to household finances since comparable records began in 1956-57 he has done nothing more for those dependent on benefits, the very poorest, besides a small amount of extra cash for local authorities to dispense at their discretion," Mr Johnson said.

"Their benefits will rise by just 3.1% for the coming financial year. Their cost of living could well rise by 10%."

MPs will consider all stages of the National Insurance Contributions (Increase of Thresholds) Bill on Thursday.

They will have up to three hours to consider the Bill at second reading and up to two hours to consider amendments, Commons Leader Mark Spencer confirmed in a business statement.

Backbench business debates originally scheduled for Thursday will be held on another day.

The Resolution Foundation think tank said Rishi Sunak's package of tax cuts was "badly designed" with little for the poorest households.

The living standards think tank's chief executive Torsten Bell said: "Middle and higher income households will gain most from the rise in the national insurance threshold, but only £1 in every £3 of additional support announced today will go to the bottom half of the income distribution.

"Looking further ahead, the promise to cut income tax only benefits those earning over £49,000 once the four-year freeze to the personal allowance is taken into account.

"The Chancellor announced a bigger package of measures than expected, but it was a badly designed one with almost no new support for the poorest households.

"Higher earners will be hardest hit by tax rises, but it makes no sense to raise national insurance while cutting income tax - 21st century Britain doesn't need to do more to make things harder for workers, and easier for landlords."

Stormont Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the Chancellor's spring statement "does not go far enough" to support people and businesses facing spiralling fuel and energy costs.

Mr Murphy said: "The Chancellor's statement provides nowhere near enough support to people and businesses struggling with the rising cost of living.

"Despite inflation being at a 30-year high, the Chancellor is tinkering on the edges.

"Increasing the threshold for national insurance contributions will help mitigate the impact of the hike on workers on the very lowest incomes, but the Chancellor should have gone further by scrapping his planned increase in national insurance entirely.

"The reduction in fuel duty for motorists is minimal. A 5p reduction will be of little comfort to motorists given that petrol and diesel prices have increased by over 20 and 30 pence per litre respectively since the start of this year.

"At a time when households are facing spiralling costs to heat their homes, today's statement fails to reduce VAT on energy bills or uprate benefits."

Rishi Sunak said he was unable to protect all households from the impact of rising global prices.

Asked about the Office for Budget Responsibility's findings on the fall in household incomes, the Chancellor told broadcasters: "We are facing the same challenges that many countries around the world are facing - that's rising prices and high inflation.

"Inflation here is running a bit lower than it is in America, similar to what is happening in the eurozone and there is uncertainty ahead.

"I wish I could - but I can't - protect everyone against the full impact of those global challenges but where we can make a difference, of course we will and that's why the policies announced today are a significant intervention.

"They will put billions of pounds back in the pockets of hard-working British families."

Conor Murphy said he would continue to push the Chancellor for more measures to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.

The Stormont Finance Minister said: "It is hugely disappointing the Chancellor is proceeding with the removal of the red diesel rebate. With businesses, our construction and agri-food sectors in particular, already facing increased prices, this additional tax burden couldn't come at a worse time.

"The Chancellor could also have imposed a windfall tax on energy companies but he chose not to."

Mr Murphy said Northern Ireland will receive £34 million in Barnett consequentials for 2022-23 as a result of the spring statement.

He added: "I have asked the Chancellor to consider ring-fencing any additional Barnett for the cost-of-living crisis. This may enable me to allocate the money for similar support here. My request remains under consideration.

"Therefore this £34 million will be added to the £300 million which in the absence of an Executive cannot be allocated to help families, communities and businesses.

"With households struggling to heat their homes and fuel their cars, the actions that the Chancellor has taken are extremely limited. Much more could and should have been done. I will continue to press the British Government to take further measures as a matter of urgency."

Glamorous ‘secret’ Russian targeted

Britain has slapped sanctions on 59 more Russians with a notable name appearing among the list.

Targets of the latest asset freeze includes Russian diamond giant Alrosa and shadowy mercenary group Wagner, known as President Vladimir Putin’s “private army”.

But it’s Polina Kovaleva — the stepdaughter of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov — that has made headlines.

Lavrov is known to be President Putin’s close ally while Ms Kovaleva is the daughter of his alleged mistress, “actress” Svetlana Polyakova.

Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s team allege Lavrov has been living a “double life” for almost two decades.

“A source from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters that everyone in the ministry knows that this woman is Lavrov’s wife and almost the most influential person in the Foreign Ministry,” a 2021 report read.

“She can fire someone she doesn’t like. She attends official events. She eventually accompanies Lavrov when he meets with Putin.”

Navalny’s team said Lavrov “lies, steals and spends money on a secret family”.

Major moves against Russia have been announced overnight as NATO, G7 and EU leaders gathered in unprecedented emergency meetings to discuss overhauling the alliance’s eastern defences.

Ms Kovaleva, 26, lives in London and leads a “glamorous” life according to Maria Pevchikh, head of investigations at Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, in a AU$7million home in Kensington in the city’s ritzy west. She purchased the multimillion-dollar apartment when she was 21, Lavrov’s report read.

But her assets have now been frozen as those associated with President Putin face serious financial consequences in an effort to pressure Russia’s elite.

Activists protested outside her home earlier as the war in Ukraine heightened, brandishing her the “daughter of a war criminal”.

Her Instagram has been deleted but Navalny’s team have been following her activity for years, including accompanying Lavrov on a business trip to Japan in 2017.

Ms Pevchikh tweeted a thread about Ms Kovaleva, saying her life looks like “a non-stop holiday”.

There are also pictures of her at ski resorts in Austria and luxurious locations including the Montenegrin villa of Deripaska.

It comes after the daughter of Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov, 24-year-old Elizaveta Peskova, was swept up by sanctions earlier this month, telling website Business Insider she was “blindsided” by the move.

“For me, it’s totally unfair and unfounded,” she said. “I was really surprised because it’s weird introducing sanctions [on] someone who is 24 years old and has nothing to do with the situation.”

The news came ahead of an emergency NATO summit in Brussels where UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson committed to a new package to help Ukraine’s fight against Russian forces.

“Vladimir Putin has already crossed the red line into barbarism,” Mr Johnson said.

“The harder our sanctions, the tougher our economic vice around the Putin regime, the more we can do to help the Ukrainians, I think the faster that this thing can be over,” he said.

The latest measures, against a range of key strategic industries and people, takes to more than 1000 the number of Russian and Belarusian individuals and businesses sanctioned by London in recent weeks.

Britain also targeted six more banks, Russian Railways, the defence company Kronshtadt — the main producer of Russian drones — and diamond giant Alrosa, according to the foreign ministry. Mr Johnson says Britain will send, 6000 missiles and £25 million ($A33 million) in financial aid to Ukraine’s army to help it fight Russian forces.

Lethal defensive military aid, including Starstreak high-velocity anti-air missiles, will “help Ukrainians continue to defend themselves,” Mr Johnson said.

“Vladimir Putin is already failing in Ukraine.”

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the latest round of sanction will hit “oligarchs, businesses and hired thugs complicit in the murder of innocent civilians”.

Germany warns on Russian gas, Poland to end oil imports

BERLIN (AP) — Germany and Austria activated early warning plans Wednesday amid concerns that Moscow could cut natural gas deliveries, while Poland announced steps to end all Russian oil imports by year’s end, in fresh signs of how Russia's war in Ukraine[https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine] is affecting Europe's energy security.

The German government said it was establishing a crisis team to step up monitoring of the gas supply, and called on companies and households to conserve energy following demands by Russia that deliveries should be paid in rubles[https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-business-germany-europe-f9f4132e84bee437d82cb9f51c58aa8e].

Western nations have rejected that demand[https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-germany-global-trade-96dbe1ef3a1e1c61431b9a78149ac62c], arguing it would undermine sanctions imposed because of the war.

“There have been several comments from the Russian side that if this (payments in rubles) doesn’t happen, then the supplies will be stopped,” Economy Minister Robert Habeck told reporters in Berlin.

Hours later, German officials said Chancellor Olaf Scholz had received assurances from Russian President Vladimir Putin that European companies won’t have to pay for Russian gas supplies in rubles but could continue to pay in euros as stipulated by existing contracts.

Scholz had asked for further details of the process, which involves payments to a Russian bank not subjected to sanctions, his office said.

Habeck had earlier said that the level one warning triggered — a step also taken Wednesday by Austria — was a precautionary measure and Germany was prepared for a sudden stop in Russian gas supplies.

Still, he warned of “considerable impacts” if that were to happen and urged consumers to help prevent a shortage by conserving energy.

“We are in a situation where, I have to say this clearly, every kilowatt hour of energy saved helps,” Habeck said. He added that Germany’s gas storages are currently filled to about 25% capacity.

A second warning level would require companies in the gas industry to take necessary measures to regulate supply. The third and highest level entails full state intervention to ensure those who most need gas — such as hospitals and private households — receive it, Habeck said.

“We’re not there and we don’t want to go there,” he added.

France also called Wednesday for “those who can” to conserve energy, including electricity and gas, focusing especially on businesses and public facilities. The country's gas storage facilities are “well filled,” according to the head of its Regulatory Energy Commission, but still asked for some efforts to save energy.

“If we don’t do that, there is a risk next winter for consumption demand to be superior to our ability to meet that demand,” Jean-Francois Carenco told the BFM news broadcaster.

France gets about 70% of its electricity from nuclear plants but uses natural gas during peak demand at winter time and for home heating.

Italy issued a pre-alert of the risks to its natural gas supply days after the war broke out, given its heavy reliance on Russia. Energy transition minister Roberto Cingolani said at the time that the warning aimed to inform users of the “uncertainties linked to the conflict,” while confirming supplies remained adequate to cover demand. It has not asked people to conserve.

Meanwhile Poland, which has taken in millions of Ukrainian refugees, has taken the lead in the European Union on swiftly cutting off Russian fossil fuels. The 27-nation bloc has declined to sanction energy because it depends on Moscow[https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-business-european-union-germany-60cd9af0e990d0e95547d2c7052f898f] for the fuel needed for cars, electricity, heating and industry, but it has announced proposals to wean itself off those supplies[https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-paris-european-union-f48482d9cc49497c186f85f556181322].

“We are presenting the most radical plan in Europe for departing from Russian oil by the end of this year,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said at a news conference.

On Tuesday Poland said it was banning Russian coal imports, expected by May. Morawiecki said Poland will take steps to become “independent” of Russian supplies and called on other European Union countries to “walk away” as well. He argued that money paid for Russia’s oil and gas is fueling its war machine.

While some in Europe are calling for an immediate boycott of all Russian oil and natural gas, the EU plans to reduce Russian gas imports by two-thirds by the end of the year and eliminate them before 2030. In the meantime, rattled energy markets have pushed up already high oil and natural gas prices[https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-lifestyle-prices-34cad398126d3eb43336ae54fe6e8ce6] for Europeans and others worldwide.

The EU is turning to investments in renewable energy [https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-climate-boris-johnson-business-germany-e13e47b5c3784fa26e61d49502797295] as a long-term fix but also is scrambling to shore up alternative sources of fossil fuels, including a new agreement with the U.S. to receive more liquefied natural gas[https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-biden-business-poland-migration-c0c3b6421fc0d454abf53b4b6dd746bb], or LNG, that arrives by ship.

Poland is expanding an LNG terminal to receive deliveries from Qatar, the U.S., Norway and other exporters. A new Baltic pipeline bringing gas from Norway is expected to open by the end of the year. It also has been reducing dependence on Russian oil through contracts with Saudi Arabia, the U.S. and Norway and is considering imports from Kazakhstan.

Germany, the EU's biggest economy and until recently reliant on Russia's natural gas for 55% of its needs, has signed deals with several suppliers of LNG, which is shipped to neighboring European countries and then pumped in. German officials say they aim to end the use of Russian oil and coal this year and natural gas by mid-2024.

Europe's Energy Dilemma Requiring Austria and Germany to Rethink in Wake of Russian Aggression

(Vindobona) Due to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, Europe has to face new questions about energy policy, which had been known for many years but were largely ignored and deferred. The much-discussed gas embargo in recent weeks is to further intensify the sanctions against Russia and its economy. Read more about the current situation.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted many states in the world, led by the West, to sanction Russia. The world community is outraged by the Russian attack on Ukraine and condemns it. For Europe, which is dependent on Russian gas, especially in the area of energy supply, a new dilemma now arises.

The much-discussed gas embargo in recent weeks will further increase the existing sanctions against Russia and pressure its economy. But for this to happen, the countries of the European Union will have to consider and agree on energy supply alternatives. While most countries agree to stop buying Russian gas, Austria and Germany are currently at a crossroads. #CUT

Europe and Russian Gas

According to the New York Times[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/business/russia-europe-natural-gas.html#:~:text=Europe%20gets%20nearly%2040%20percent,the%20region's%20support%20of%20Ukraine.], Russia provided 40 percent of Europe's gas last year. Within a year the European Union plans to cut dependency by two-thirds and wants to end the current unhealthy entanglement by 2030.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine is reshaping global and european energy markets. Gas from Russia has long been used to heat homes and in the power industry of Europe. In Addition, Europe used to power its electric utilities, mainly with gas from Russia delivered through pipelines.

The current situation and increasingly conflictual relationship with Russia require drastic measures. The sanctions against Russia are to become tougher and tougher to contain the Russian aspirations. In the event of a gas embargo, which would hit Russia hard, Europe will have to look for new distributors for gas or energy. In addition, the entire pipeline infrastructure, which has cost several billion, will become obsolete.

The western partners of the European Union, such as Canada and the U.S., have already warned the EU about this situation. In 2016, for example[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-europe-usa-idUSKCN1101AP?utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_content=57bef40504d3010e1b76cfc9&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter], Joe Biden, while still vice president under the presidency of Barack Obama, warned Europe against dependence on Russian gas and the construction of the Nordstream 2 pipeline. Biden described the purchase of Russian gas and Nordstream 2 as a "bad deal" for Europe.

Regarding Nordstream 2, Gazprom and its European partners have agreed that the project, which will run across the Baltic Sea to Germany, is feasible.

Yet many eastern European countries, as well as the United States, feared the pipeline could impede supply routes and energy security for the European Union, which gets a third of its gas from Russia.

The current energy dilemma has been brewing for the last few years and is now presenting Europe with new challenges.

To contain Russia's aspirations it seems necessary to use all possible sanctions. While the U.S. and several EU states are pushing for a Russian energy embargo, Germany and Austria are firmly opposed to this.

Austria and Germany at crossroads

Although Austria and Germany participate in the sanctions and condemn the Russian attack, both countries still seem hesitant about the gas embargo.

Austria continues to strongly oppose the gas embargo. Both Germany and Austria believe that sanctions only make sense if they do not affect one more than the targeted party.

According to ORF[https://orf.at/stories/3257769/], Austria was 100 percent on Germany's side on the issue, Finance Minister Magnus Brunner (ÖVP) said before a meeting of the Euro Group yesterday in Luxembourg.

German Economy Minister Robert Habeck (Greens) also stated that Germany is against an immediate energy embargo. According to the German Government[https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2022-04/bundesregierung-robert-habeck-russland-energie?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F], an immediate embargo with a halt to gas deliveries would damage the German economy much more than it would Putin's economy.

Both countries are heavily dependent on Russian gas and like to reorganize their energy supplies before a gas embargo comes in, according to statements by the governments of the two countries.

A gas embargo as a sanction would only be possible later for both countries.

Europe's current gas dilemma

While most governments of the European Union agree to enforce a gas embargo to push Putin back, Germany and Austria, as already mentioned, do not yet agree.

As reported by Vindobona.org[https://www.vindobona.org/article/nehammer-at-eu-summit-russia-sanctions-and-western-balkans-support], the U.S. will support Europe and is already supplying liquid gas to curb dependence on Russian gas. The U.S. and Europe are working together to take concrete measures to reduce dependence on natural gas and maximize the availability and use of renewable energy. These measures will not only counter Russia's aspirations for dominance further, but also combats climate change.

In order to achieve this, however, the unity and cooperation of the states in the European Union and the entire West are needed.

Austria expels four Russian diplomats

Vienna/Kyiv/Kiev)/Moscow - After several days of hesitating, Austria has joined the European sanction measures against Russia diplomats. According to a spokeswoman for Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg (conservative People's Party, VP) on Thursday, the diplomatic status of three members of the Russian embassy in Vienna, and one member of the consulate general in Salzburg was lifted.

The people in question must leave Austria by April 12.

According to the ministry, the people had taken actions which were not compatible with the Vienna Convention. This was regarding secret service activity.

Schallenberg still said on Austrian national ORF television on Tuesday night that there was no reason for expulsion. However, he said that he would take action if there were "strong indicators" of such violations by diplomats.

European leaders stream into Ukraine to show solidarity

LONDON (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer on Saturday joined the stream of European leaders showing their support for Ukraine by traveling to the nation’s capital for face-to-face meetings with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Johnson’s surprise visit included a pledge of new military assistance, including 120 armored vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems. This came a day after he promised to send an additional 100 million pounds ($130 million) of high-grade military equipment to Ukraine, saying Britain wanted to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. [https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-zelenskyy-kyiv-business-europe-ff7461d55cbf135e33b51ccbdc4d3e2b]

Johnson also confirmed further economic support, guaranteeing an additional $500 million in World Bank lending to Ukraine, taking Britain's total loan guarantee to up to $1 billion.

“Today I met my friend President @ZelenskyyUa in Kyiv as a show of our unwavering support for the people of Ukraine,'' Johnson said on Twitter. “We’re setting out a new package of financial & military aid which is a testament of our commitment to his country’s struggle against Russia’s barbaric campaign.''

The head of Ukraine's presidential office, Andriy Yermak, said “the conversation was rich and constructive,” but offered no details.

An image of the two leaders meeting was posted online by the Ukrainian Embassy in London with the headline: “Surprise,” and a winking smiley face.

The package of military aid Britain announced Friday includes more Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles, another 800 anti-tank missiles and precision munitions capable of lingering in the sky until directed to their target.

“Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century,″ Johnson said in a statement. “It is because of President Zelenskyy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people that Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted.''

As Zelenskyy makes a continuous round of virtual appearances to drum up support from lawmakers around the world, an increasing number of European leaders have decided the time is right to travel to Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, for in-person talks. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was in Kyiv on Friday, following earlier visits from the Czech, Polish and Slovenian prime ministers.

Nehammer met with Zelenskyy earlier Saturday and pledged that the EU would continue to ratchet up sanctions against Russia “until the war stops.”

“As long as people are dying, every sanction is still insufficient,” he said, adding that Austrian embassy staff will return to Kyiv from western Ukraine.

Von der Leyen, who heads the European Union’s executive branch, travelled to Warsaw on Saturday to lead a fundraising event for Ukraine. She was joined by Polish President Andrzej Duda, with Zelenskyy and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appearing by video link.

At the end of the 90-minute meeting, von der Leyen said 10.1 billion euros ($11 billion) had been raised for Ukrainian refugees.

The event was held in Warsaw because more than 2.5 million of the 4.4 million people who have fled Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began Feb. 24 have entered Poland. Many have stayed, though some have moved on to other countries.

Convened jointly by von der Leyen and Trudeau, the event sought to attract pledges from governments, global celebrities and average citizens.

It ended with Julian Lennon singing his father John Lennon’s peace song “Imagine," which he said is the first time he did so publicly.

Julian Lennon posted on social media that he always said he would only sing the song if it was the “end of the world.” He says it’s the right song to sing now because “the war on Ukraine is an unimaginable tragedy,” and he felt compelled to respond in the most significant way that he could.

SANTIAGO, Chile — Dozens of protesters gathered in front of the Russian embassy in Chile’s capital of Santiago on Saturday to denounce the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Protesters unfurled a large banner featuring the colors of the Ukrainian flag. The group included Ukrainians living in Chile.

Some protesters lay down on the ground and clutched stuffed animals to honor child victims of the war. A large banner read, “Stand with Ukraine.”

“We want to be united at this time with our children, with our families,” said Alina Prus, a Ukrainian living in Chile. “Several of us have our families who are now living the horror of what war means.”

Another protester, Dária Gryshko, said many Ukrainians living in Chile have family or friends living both there and in Russia.

“It is painful to see how families break up, how relationships break up, when opinions are divided within a family,” she said. “Because the people who live in Russia are exposed to a lot of propaganda, even when you show them video of what is happening now, they don’t believe, because they don’t come out from their TV.”

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS:

BORODIANKA, Ukraine — Firefighters continued searching Saturday for survivors or the dead in the debris of destroyed buildings in a northern Ukrainian town that was occupied for weeks by Russian forces.

Residents of Borodianka expect to find dozens of victims under the rubble of the several buildings destroyed during fighting between Russian forces and Ukrainian troops. The town is about 75 kilometers (47 miles) northwest of the capital of Kyiv and had more than 12,000 residents.

Russian troops occupied Borodianka while advancing towards Kyiv in an attempt to encircle it. They retreated during the last days of March following fierce fighting. The town is without electricity, natural gas or other services.

A 77-year-old resident, Maria Vaselenko, said her daughter and son-in-law’s bodies have been under rubble for 36 days because Russian soldiers would not allow residents to search for loved ones or their bodies. She said her two teenage grandchildren escaped to Poland but are now orphans.

“The Russians were shooting. And some people wanted to come and help, but they were shooting them,” she told The Associated Press. “They were putting explosives under dead people.”

___

MARIUPOL, Ukraine -- Shelling by Russian forces of Ukraine’s key port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov has collapsed several humanitarian corridors and made conditions seldom right for people to leave.

It was not clear Saturday how many people remained trapped in the city, which had a prewar population of 430,000. Ukrainian officials have put the number at about 100,000, but earlier this week, British defense officials said 160,000 people remained trapped in the city.

Ukrainian troops have refused to surrender the city, though much of it has been razed.

Resident Sergey Petrov said Saturday that recently two shells struck around him in quick succession, but neither exploded upon landing. He was in his garage at the time and said his mother later told him, “I was born again.”

“A shell flew in and broke up into two parts but it did not explode, looks like it did not land on the detonator but on its side,” he said.

He added that when another shell flew in and hit the garage, “I am in shock. I don’t understand what is happening. I have a hole in my garage billowing smoke. I run away and leave everything. I come back in several hours and find another shell lying there, also unexploded.”

___

ATHENS, Greece — A Ukrainian soccer club on Saturday opened a series of charity games on a government-backed “Global Tour for Peace” wearing the names of heavily bombarded cities on its jerseys.

The tour by the Shakhtar Donetsk club aims to raise money for Ukraine’s military in the war against Russia, and also help Ukrainian refugees displaced by the war.

Its first game Saturday was a 1-0 loss to Greek league leader Olympiakos.

Soccer clubs around Europe have been offering to play games against Ukrainian clubs and host youth players after soccer in the country was shut down when Russia invaded in February.

Shakhtar already was displaced from its home of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine in 2014.

Playing in the Athens area on Saturday, Shakhtar players replaced their names on the back of their jerseys with those of cities bombarded by Russian forces, including Mariupol.

___

BUCHA, Ukraine -- Civilians remaining in Bucha lined up Saturday for food donated by the local church in the battered Kyiv suburb where Ukrainian forces and journalists reported evidence of war crimes after Russian soldiers withdrew.

With other civilians fleeing in the wake of Russia’s invasion, most of the people remaining in Bucha were elderly, poor or unable to leave loved ones. Russian troops withdrew more than a week ago.

Volunteer Petro Denysyuk told The Associated Press that he and fellow church friends started providing food, with a wide array of basic foodstuffs and hot meals.

“We have gathered together with the youth from our church and prepared food for the needy,” Denysyuk said. “We prepared pilaf, boiled eggs, prepared meat, sausages, noodles.”

Ukrainian forces and journalists that went into Bucha saw bodies strewn in the streets, evidence of summary executions and the remains of people who could not have threatened soldiers. Russia has denied accusations of war crimes and accused Kyiv of staging them.

___

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the leaders of Britain and Austria for their visits to Kyiv on Saturday and pledges of further support.

In his daily late-night video address to the nation, Zelenskyy also thanked European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for a global fundraising event that raised more than 10 billion euros ($11 billion) for Ukrainians who have had to flee their homes.

Zelenskyy said democratic countries were united in working to stop the war. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer became the latest of several European rulers to meet Zelenskky in Kyiv.

“Because Russian aggression was not intended to be limited to Ukraine alone, to the destruction only of our freedom and our life,” he said. “The entire European project is a target for Russia.”

Zelenskyy repeated his call for a complete embargo on Russian oil and gas, calling them the sources of Russia’s “self-confidence and impunity.”

“But Ukraine does not have time to wait. Freedom does not have time to wait. When tyranny begins its aggression against everything that keeps the peace in Europe, action must be taken immediately,” he said.

He added: “And an oil embargo must be the first step. Moreover, by all democratic states, the entire civilized world. Then Russia will feel it. Then it will be an argument for them to seek peace, to stop the senseless violence.”

LVIV, Ukraine — Eyewitness descriptions are coming from Kramatorsk, the town in eastern Ukraine where a missile hit a train station packed with evacuees on Friday.

The Sydorenko family could have been among the 52 dead and more than 100 wounded, but their taxi didn’t show and they had to wait for another one. They finally arrived for the 11 a.m. evacuation train just three minutes after the explosion.

Ivan Sydorenko says there were around 2,000 people inside the station and on the platforms when the missile hit. He says they got out of their taxi in a scene of burning cars, burning pieces of the missile and people fleeing for their lives.

Ivan managed to escape by bus and then train with his wife and daughter, eventually reaching the relative safety of Lviv in western Ukraine. The Sydorenkos are just one of thousands of families clamoring to leave eastern Ukraine ahead of an expected Russian onslaught there.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 10 evacuation corridors were planned for Saturday, and other stations were open for trains full of refugees.

Russia meanwhile has denied responsibility, accusing Ukraine’s military of firing on the station to try to turn blame for civilian slayings on Moscow.

KYIV, Ukraine — Panicked residents of eastern Ukraine boarded buses or looked for other ways to leave Saturday, a day after a missile strike killed at least 52 people and wounded more than 100 at a train station.

The attack in in Kramatorsk left the city with no trains running and came with thousands of people seeking to leave. Ukrainian authorities have called on civilians to get out ahead of an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the east.

Residents on Saturday feared the kind of unrelenting assaults and occupations by Russian invaders that brought food shortages, demolished buildings and death to other cities elsewhere in Ukraine.

“It was terrifying. The horror, the horror,” one resident told British broadcaster Sky, recalling Friday’s attack on the train station. “Heaven forbid, to live through this again. No, I don’t want to.”

Western military analysts said an arc of territory in eastern Ukraine was under Russian control. It was from Kharkiv — Ukraine’s second-largest city — in the north to Kherson in the south.

But Ukrainian counterattacks are threatening Russian control of Kherson, according to the Western assessments, and Ukrainian forces are repelling Russian assaults elsewhere in the Donbas region in the southeast.

WASHINGTON — U.S. intelligence officials predict Russian President Vladimir Putin may use U.S. support for Ukraine as justification for a new campaign to interfere in American politics.

Intelligence officials tell The Associated Press that they have yet to find any evidence that Putin has authorized measures like the ones Russia undertook in the last two elections to support former President Donald Trump. Several people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive findings said it remains unclear which candidates Russia might try to promote next.

Trump has repeatedly assailed U.S. intelligence officials and claimed that investigations of Russian influence on his campaigns to be political vendettas. In Ukraine and elsewhere, Russia has been accused of trying to spread disinformation, amplifying pro-Kremlin voices in the West and using cyberattacks to disrupt governments.

Top U.S. intelligence officials are still working on plans for a new Foreign Malign Influence Center, authorized by Congress, that will focus on foreign influence campaigns by Russia, China and other adversaries.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told The Associated Press on Saturday that he is committed to seeking peace despite Russian attacks on civilians that have stunned the world.

He said no one wants to negotiate with people who tortured their nation — “as a man, as a father, I understand this very well.” But he said “we don’t want to lose opportunities, if we have them, for a diplomatic solution.”

Zelenskyy said he’s confident Ukrainians would accept peace despite the horrors they have witnessed in the war. But meanwhile, Russian troops are regrouping for an expected surge in fighting in eastern Ukraine, including the besieged port city of Mariupol that Ukrainian defenders are battling to retain.

So Zelenskyy renewed his plea for countries to send more weapons. He says they have to fight for life -- not “for dust when there is nothing and no people. That’s why it is important to stop this war.”

KYIV, Ukraine — U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, promising so much support that his nation might never be bullied again.

Johnson’s surprise visit included a pledge of 120 armored vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems, part of another 100 million pounds ($130 million) of high-grade military equipment. Johnson also confirmed an additional $500 million in World Bank lending, taking Britain’s total loan guarantee up to $1 billion.

Johnson said Ukraine defied the odds pushing Russian forces “from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century.″

The prime minister credits “Zelenskyy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people” for thwarting what he calls the “monstrous aims” of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Johnson says Britain and its partners “are going to ratchet up the economic pressure ... not just freezing assets in banks and sanctioning oligarchs but moving away from use of Russian hydrocarbons.”

Johnson also described a vision for a future Ukraine so fortified and protected by the equipment, technology and know-how of Britain and its partners that it can never be threatened in the same way again. In the meantime, Johnson said, “there is a huge amount to do to make sure that Ukraine is successful, that Ukraine wins and that Putin must fail.”

MILAN — An Italian government source said Italian Premier Mario Draghi is traveling to Algeria on Monday to sign a deal for more gas.

Italy has been urgently looking for alternatives to natural gas from Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. Russia is Italy’s biggest supplier, representing 40% of total imports.

Italy’s foreign minister has traveled to Algeria as well as Azerbaijan, Qatar, Congo, Angola and Mozambique to secure more deals. Algeria is Italy’s second-largest supplier of natural gas, which is the main source of the nation’s electricity, providing some 21 billion cubic meters of gas via the Trans-Mediterranean pipeline.

Italian energy company ENI has operated in Algeria for 40 years. ENI announced a significant oil and gas discovery in Algeria last month and said it would work with Algerian partner Sonatrach to fast-track its development for the third quarter of this year.

Julian Lennon has explained why he decided to sing his father’s song “Imagine” for the first time publicly.

He’s posted on social media that he always said he would only sing the song if it was the End of the World. He says it’s the right song to sing now because “the War on Ukraine is an unimaginable tragedy,” and he felt compelled to respond in the most significant way he could.

The son of John Lennon says murderous violence in Ukraine is forcing millions of innocent families to leave the comfort of their homes. He says the lyrics reflect our collective desire for peace worldwide, and “within this song, we’re transported to a space, where love and togetherness become our reality, if but for a moment in time.”

Lennon joined celebrities around the world calling on world leaders to do more to support refugees in the Stand Up For Ukraine campaign.

BOSTON -- The International Monetary Fund has created an account to give donor countries a secure way to funnel financial assistance directly to war-ravaged Ukraine.

The multilateral lender said in a statement Friday that it’s launching the account at the request of several member countries.

The goal is to help Ukraine meet its payment obligations and help stabilize its economy using loans or grants from pooled resources.

The IMF says Canada has proposed routing up to 1 billion Canadian dollars ($795 million) to Ukraine through the new account.

Two weeks after Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, the IMF approved a $1.4 billion emergency loan to Ukraine.

BOSTON -- S&P Global Ratings has downgraded its assessment of Russia’s ability to repay foreign debt, signaling increased prospects that Moscow will soon default on such loans for the first time in more than a century.

The credit ratings agency issued the downgrade to “selective default” Friday night after Russia arranged to make foreign bond payments in rubles last week when they were due in dollars. It said it didn’t expect Russia to be able to convert the rubles into dollars within a 30-day grace period.

S&P said it believes sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine are likely to increase, impeding its willingness and ability to honor its obligations to foreign debtholders.

The Kremlin has signaled it’s willing to pay its debts but warned it would do so in rubles if its overseas accounts in foreign currencies remain frozen.

WARSAW, Poland – The head of the European Union’s executive branch says 10.1 billion euros ($11 billion) have been raised globally in a fundraising event for Ukraine and people who have fled the country invaded by Russia.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was joined at the event in Warsaw by Polish President Andrzej Duda and -- remotely -- by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

At the end of the 90-minute event, a smiling von der Leyen said the donations will go to help refugees, both outside and inside Ukraine.

“We will continue providing support. And once the bombs have stopped falling, we will help the people of Ukraine rebuild their country,” von der Leyen said.

Saturday’s pledging event was held in Warsaw because more than 2.5 million of the 4.4 million people who have fled Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began Feb. 24 have entered Poland. Many have stayed, though some have moved on to other countries. The event aimed to prompt political leaders and global celebrities to provide funding and other donations for the people of Ukraine.

It ended with Julian Lennon singing his father John Lennon’s peace song “Imagine.”

MOSCOW -- YouTube has banned the channel of Russia’s lower house of parliament, the State Duma, prompting government officials to renew longtime threats against the platform.

The Duma TV channel reported the ban on the messaging app Telegram, noting that it had 145,000 subscribers and over 100,000 million total views. In comments to the Russian news agency Interfax, Google didn’t give an exact reason for the move, but said the company follows “all applicable sanction and trade compliance laws.”

Russia’s state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor demanded that YouTube unblock the channel. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Saturday that the service “has handed itself a sentence” and urged its users to “download content, transfer it onto Russian platforms. And fast.”

State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin called the move against the parliament’s YouTube channel “another proof of violations of the rights and freedoms of citizens by Washington.”

Zelenskyy: Russian aggression not limited to Ukraine alone

英文
Copyright 2022. Irish Examiner Ltd.
Russia is targeting all of Europe with its invasion of Ukraine, and stopping Moscow’s aggression is essential for the security of all democracies, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said as Russian forces prepared for battle in the east of his country.

Addressing the “free people of a brave country,” Mr Zelenskyy said in a late-night video message to Ukrainians that Russia’s war aim “was not intended to be limited to Ukraine alone” and the “entire European project is a target”.

“That is why it is not just the moral duty of all democracies, all the forces of Europe, to support Ukraine’s desire for peace,” he said.

“This is, in fact, a strategy of defence for every civilised state.”

His address came as civilians continued to flee eastern parts of the country before an expected onslaught and emergency workers searched for survivors in towns north of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, that are no longer occupied by Russian forces.

Russia has pulled its troops from the northern part of the country and refocused on the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian troops for eight years and controlled some territory before the war, now in its 46th day.

Western military analysts said an arc of territory in eastern Ukraine was under assault, from Kharkiv — Ukraine’s second-largest city — in the north to Kherson in the south.

Newly released Maxar Technologies satellite imagery collected Friday showed an eight-mile convoy of military vehicles headed south to the Donbas through the town of Velykyi Burluk.

However, Western assessments expressed increasing confidence in the ability of Ukraine’s defenders to repel Russian assaults, portraying Russia’s troops as suffering from low morale and mounting casualties.

Britain’s Defence Ministry said on Sunday that the Russian military was seeking to respond to mounting losses by boosting troop numbers with personnel who have been discharged from military service since 2012.

In an update on Twitter, the ministry also said that the Russian military’s efforts to “generate more fighting power” also include trying to recruit from Trans-Dniester, a breakaway region in Moldova that borders Ukraine.

Russia-backed separatists in eastern Moldova took up arms in 1992 to establish Trans-Dniester, which is not internationally recognised and where Russia maintains some 1,500 troops.

Several European leaders have made efforts to show solidarity with battle-scarred Ukraine.

In his video address, Mr Zelenskyy thanked the leaders of Britain and Austria for their visits to Kyiv on Saturday and pledges of further support.

He also thanked the European Commission president and Canada’s prime minister for a global fundraising event that brought in more than 10 billion euros for the millions of Ukrainians who have fled their homes.

Mr Zelenskyy repeated his call for a complete embargo on Russian oil and gas, which he called the sources of Russia’s “self-confidence and impunity”. Some European countries depend heavily on imported Russian energy.

“Freedom does not have time to wait,” Mr Zelenskyy said. “When tyranny begins its aggression against everything that keeps the peace in Europe, action must be taken immediately.”

In an interview with The Associated Press inside his heavily guarded presidential office complex, Mr Zelenskyy said he was committed to negotiating a diplomatic end to the war even though Russia has “tortured” Ukraine.

He also acknowledged that peace likely will not come quickly. Talks so far have not included Russian President Vladimir Putin or other top officials.

“We have to fight, but fight for life. You can’t fight for dust when there is nothing and no people. That’s why it is important to stop this war,” the president said.

Ukrainian authorities have accused Russia forces of committing war crimes against thousands of civilians during the invasion, including air strikes on hospitals, a missile attack that killed 52 people at a train station on Friday and shooting residents of towns in the north at close range.

Graphic evidence of civilian slayings emerged after Russian forces withdrew from Bucha, and firefighters were searching buildings in Borodyanka, another settlement outside Kyiv. Russia has denied engaging in war crimes and falsely claimed that the scenes in Bucha were staged.

Ukrainian authorities have said they expect to find more mass killings once they reach the southern port city of Mariupol, which is also in the Donbas and has been subjected to a month-long blockade and intense fighting.

The city’s location on the Sea of Azov is critical to establishing a land bridge from the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine eight years ago.

Ukrainian officials have pleaded with Western powers almost daily to send more arms and further punish Moscow with sanctions, including the exclusion of Russian banks from the global financial system and a total EU embargo on Russian gas and oil.

During his visit on Saturday, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said he expects more EU sanctions against Russia, but defended his country’s opposition so far to cutting off deliveries of Russian gas.

A package of sanctions imposed this week “won’t be the last one,” the chancellor said, acknowledging that “as long as people are dying, every sanction is still insufficient”. Austria is militarily neutral and not a member of Nato.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s visit came a day after the UK pledged an additional £100 million in high-grade military equipment.

Mr Johnson also confirmed further economic support, guaranteeing an additional 500 million dollars (£385m) in World Bank lending to Ukraine, taking Britain’s total loan guarantee to up to one billion dollars.

In the interview with AP, Mr Zelenskyy noted the increased support but expressed frustration when asked if weapons and equipment Ukraine has received from the West is sufficient to shift the war’s outcome.

“Not yet,” he said, switching to English for emphasis. “Of course it’s not enough.”

ENERGY SECURITY: EU-OPEC Meeting Today

European Union and OPEC officials will hold talks in Vienna today as the EU
explores potential sanctions on Russian oil and OPEC continues to resist calls
to hike oil production.

* OPEC is expected to maintain their modest production increase of 432,000
  barrels per day beyond May and has already rejected calls from the United
  States and the International Energy Agency in hike oil production to cool oil
  markets.
* According to Reuters, foreign ministers of Ireland, Lithuania, and the
  Netherlands have said that the European Commission is 'drafting a proposal
  for an oil embargo on Russia' ahead of a EU Commission meeting in Luxembourg
  today.
* Any plan to sanction or ban Russia oil will receive pushback from EU states
  with a high dependency on Russian oil but that resistance is beginning to
  soften as reports of Russia war crimes in Ukraine continue to emerge.
* Kadri Simson, EU Commissioner for Energy: 'Visiting Austria as part of the
  EU's energy outreach in the context of Russia's military aggression against
  Ukraine. I will have a string of meetings including OPEC Secretariat, Energy

Diplomat: U.S. responsible for delay in Vienna talks

TEHRAN — In an interview with a Croatian newspaper, Parviz Esmaeili, Iran’s ambassador to Zagreb talked about the Vienna talks, regional issues, the Ukraine crisis, and the developments in Yemen.

The ambassador said Iran is seriously pursuing an agreement to revitalize the 2015 nuclear agreement, and has so far shown enough flexibility.

Below is a part of the interview:

The (Vienna) negotiations have been suspended for several weeks. Iranian officials stress that if the United States does not cross Iran’s red lines, they are ready to sign a deal at any moment. What are these red lines? Are we really close to a nuclear deal between Iran and the world powers?

Our red line is our national interests and security. The new Iranian government has pursued the negotiations by offering initiatives for a lasting agreement. The European parties and the P4+1 know that we are seriously seeking an agreement and have shown the necessary flexibility, as well as good faith. The American side has received our message well that it is necessary to completely lift the sanctions that were lifted in the JCPOA, as well as all the sanctions that Trump imposed on us after leaving the 2015 nuclear deal.

It seems that we and the P4+1 are very close to the point of agreement. Now the main responsibility for any delay in striking the agreement lies with the U.S. government, which must reach an agreement with one or two important decisions. If Mr. Biden's administration wants to return to the 2015 agreement incompletely, or to exploit some of the sanctions imposed by Trump as a political tool against us, it must also take responsibility for not having an agreement in Vienna.

It is better for Mr. Biden not to repeat Trump's bitter and failed experience of hostility and maximum pressure on Iran. We see the success of the Vienna talks as a victory for diplomacy and a success for political and economic stability in the world. We have all had very difficult negotiations to reach this agreement. It must therefore be ensured that, if agreed, it is not easily violated by either party.

Rumors have been spread by the European Union and the United States that Russia is sabotaging the signing of the agreement. What does Russia really want, what kind of guarantee? Can Russia’s demands make an agreement impossible? And if this is true, is Russia trying to prove that Iran cannot replace Russian gas and oil in the global market?

What matters to us is the outcome of the negotiations, not the rumors and quotes. Multilateral negotiations are naturally more complex and difficult. We have witnessed bilateral or multilateral negotiations between the parties of the JCPOA many times. Each of them has submitted comments and requests at different times. Sometimes France, sometimes Russia and sometimes others. This is the nature of multilateral negotiations. But we do not go into the details of their negotiations with each other and focus on the demands, national interests and rights of our country.

An agreement with Iran will be a great help to the political and economic balance around the world. We hope that cross-cutting or minor requests of each party will not have a negative impact on this important goal. Recent rumors are not true. The world energy market is very large and it is practically impossible to eliminate any of the major energy producers, including Russia and Iran.

What is Iran's position on the war in Ukraine? Has Russia's invasion of Ukraine affected Iran-Russia relations?

We are the victims of the longest war of the last century, in which world powers unitedly supported Saddam's aggression against my country. We are well acquainted with the suffering of the war-torn people. Therefore, opposing the war and insisting on resolving disputes through negotiations is one of the principles of Iran's foreign policy.

No dispute should be considered a permit to start a war and kill and injure women and children. From the beginning of the crisis, Iran, in contact with Russian or Ukrainian officials and other influential parties, has called for an immediate ceasefire, full respect for international law and the territorial integrity of both countries, providing full security for civilians, and the settlement of disputes through dialogue. The damage to the people of Ukraine and the destruction of the infrastructure of that country, and of any other nation, is very distressing, and we hope that the negotiations will lead to an end to the conflict and a lasting peace as soon as possible.

But it should be noted that long-term resolution of disputes requires addressing its roots. The situation in the Eastern European region is fragile, and a small mistake may extend the scope of the crisis. Therefore, the parties and other countries affected by the crisis must refrain from any provocative actions that ignores the security and national sovereignty of others.

I basically believe that war is avoidable. Prevention of war in Ukraine was also possible through negotiations, but some countries seem to have preferred war. Mr. Biden traveled to Poland and emphasized ousting Putin rather than being concerned for the Ukrainian people. They are used to making decisions for other nations. It is the right of the people of Russia, Ukraine and any country to choose their leaders.

Unfortunately, the world powers have shown in practice that they are more interested in weapons than in dialogue. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact also collapsed. But the West not only did not limit NATO, but also continuously expanded its geostrategic sphere and missions. There is nothing wrong with some countries having a common defense and security pact, but it is not acceptable for such pacts to become a tool to maintain the hegemony of powers and threaten the security of other countries.

International organizations should also avoid using double standards in dealing with issues related to world peace and security. Unfortunately, the United Nations, and especially the Security Council, have repeatedly ignored this issue, causing it to become discredited and responsible for crises. The people of Palestine and Yemen are a major example of this.

It has been more than 7 years since Saudi Arabia and its supporters invaded Yemen. So far, about 380,000 civilians, including 10,000 Yemeni children have been killed in bombings or from starvation and lack of medicine. Millions have been displaced. But we did not see decisive action from the United Nations. Not only did the Western powers not punish and sanction the Saudi government and the aggressors, but they also provided them with weapons and intelligence.

World peace will not be available until the day we discriminate between human beings and nations. I ask you: Saudi Arabia executed 81 Shias and critics in a single day. What was the reaction of the West and the international community?

At the same time, our relations with Russia, Ukraine and any other country are solely subject to the fixed principles of our foreign policy and are based on respect and observance of mutual interests.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

JOHN VAUSE, CNN HOST: Hello and welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm John Vause live in Lviv, Ukraine where there's now smoke rising from a number of locations around this city. The mayor confirms at least five missile strikes in the past 45 minutes. This comes after an air raid warning earlier in the day. The mayor now telling or the regional governor, rather, telling residents to remain in place, remain in their shelters, the threat is still relevant. It's still current.

What we heard earlier today was a number of explosions, at least five explosions ring out. We also believe that this obviously is the first attack on this city in about three weeks. The last being March 26th when a Russian strike hit a fuel depot setting that on fire. But right now what we're trying to work out is to find those areas that were hit by these five missiles, like at least missile strikes according to the mayor here, what those targets were.

We're also told by the city officials that emergency crews are responding to the areas that were targeted in this latest attack. They are now on the scene. We have no word at this point on (inaudible) of casualties. We don't know what was hit. We do not know if anybody has been killed. Those details, we'll get them to you as soon as we know them.

At this point what we can confirm is that there were five loud explosions which were heard -- I heard them, I counted them, one after the other within the last 40, 45 minutes. And now we have plumes of smoke rising over a number of locations from this city. This is an area which has been spared the worst of the Russian military assault for the most part. The last attack as I say being March 26th.

There was another missile strike, Russian air strike on a military facility not far from here and close to the Polish border, but for the most part, that has been it for the area of Lviv here in western Ukraine. Now, we have this situation with at least five loud explosions. Five missile strikes somewhere on the outskirts or around the city here of Lviv.

We'll continue to follow this story. We'll bring you details as soon as we get them. In the meantime, we'll follow the rest of the developments now out of Ukraine with the president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, now saying Russia is preparing for a major offensive in the east and that will happen soon.

This comes as Russian troops appear poised to capture the southern port city of Mariupol. That's a crucial link in Russia's efforts to create a land bridge between a stronghold in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Weeks of heavy fighting have left Mariupol in ruins and Zelenskyy says the same kind of destruction could be coming soon for the Donbas region in the east.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translation): Russian troops are preparing for an offensive operation in the east of our country. It will begin in the near future. They want to literally finish off and destroy Donbas, destroy everything that once gave glory to this industrial region. Just as the Russian troops are destroying Mariupol, they want to wipe out other cities and communities in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VAUSE: Russia is also intensifying its assault on Ukraine's second largest city. And a warning, the video you are about to see contains some graphic images. The northeastern city of Kharkiv came under heavy shelling on Sunday. The regional governor says at least five people were killed, 20 were injured. But he says Ukrainian forces managed to push the Russians back to the east of the city, which could hamper Russian supply lines through the Donbas region.

In the coming hours, Russian forces are expected to close all exit and entry points into and out of Mariupol. An adviser to the mayor says that will leave tens of thousands of civilians with no way to escape. And also warns the men who remain would be "filtered out." CNN cannot independently verify that claim, but we have more now from CNN's Matt Rivers.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A Russian ultimatum to Mariupol's defenders. Surrender by 1:00 p.m. Sunday. The Ukrainians did not listen. "Our defenders continue to hold the defense," said an adviser to Mariupol's mayor in response.

DENYS SHMYHAL, UKRAINIAN PRIME MINISTER: Now, city still has not fallen. There is still our military forces, our soldiers. So, they will fight until the end. And as for now, they still are in Mariupol.

RIVERS (voice-over): A main pocket of resistance centered here at the Azovstal steel plant. It is unclear how many fighters remain in the city. Still difficult for CNN to gather verified information. A lack of internet service makes reliably contacting people in the city extremely hard.

Still, what is coming out of the city shows that it is now almost completely occupied by Russian troops. Keen to show off their handing out rations to starving civilians, but the Ukrainian parliament human rights commissioner says such handouts are mere propaganda amounting to no more than a loaf of bread and a bottle of water per day.

It is the Russian military, remember, that has caused such suffering. It's weeks' long bombardment of Mariupol cutting off its population from food, water and medical supplies.

[02:05:03]

President Zelenskyy says the situation in Mariupol remains as severe as possible. Just inhuman. This is what the Russian federation did, deliberately did, and deliberately continues to destroy cities. Russia is deliberately trying to destroy everyone who is there in Mariupol.

An estimated 100,000 people remain in and around Mariupol and need to be evacuated, but they remain trapped. On Sunday, not one humanitarian corridor was open. Meaning getting large numbers of people out remained impossible. Russia's military goals are clear. Dominate Mariupol and move on.

SAMUEL RAMANI, OXFORD UNIVERSITY: Mariupol has to fall before they can move those forces back up to the rest of eastern Ukraine.

RIVERS (on camera): And those Russian forces getting freed up to move does what?

RAMANI: If you free up those forces that means that they'll be able to more aggressively conquer Kharkiv, for example, which is where they're already launching shellings almost every single day and also they'll be able to move more of those forces towards Odessa.

RIVERS (voice-over): But for now, Mariupol still has not fallen. Destruction from previous battles litter the city's landscape and as Ukraine's remaining forces decline to surrender on Sunday, Russia with a chilling response. Its defense ministry saying in part "in case of further resistance, all of them will be eliminated." Matt Rivers, CNN, Lviv, Ukraine.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

VAUSE: Let's go live to Kyiv now. Michael Bociurkiw is the senior fellow of the Atlantic Council, also a former spokesperson for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Michael, I want to ask you about the strikes that we have had here in Lviv within the past hour.

But first a reminder to our audience and to you as well, of course, you know the rules. We cannot give away locations of where these strikes took place. We cannot act as spotters for the Russian military, which is why we'll speak in general terms about areas that might have been hit. So what do you know about these five missile strikes here in Lviv?

MICHAEL BOCIURKIW, SENIOR FELLOW, ATLANTIC COUNCIL: Yes, as you reported, they were announced by the mayor. But somewhat I can see from open source data, it looks like it's different, John, from the last strikes, which were more -- there was a fuel depot, things like that, lots of black smoke. The smoke, again, we're not giving away any locations or anything, seems to indicate more residential neighborhoods. And there's a map that shows -- a general map, again, possibly closer to transport facilities. I'll leave it at that.

But you know, the main takeaway here is that, and I wrote this in my CNN op-ed last week, and I hate to be right sometimes, John, but as long as the Russians have the ability to target Ukraine with those long-range missiles, no area of Ukraine can be considered safe. And actually, right now here in Kyiv we are under an air raid alert as well.

There have been several over the past 48 hours. And that is why the Ukrainian government is so insistent on having the ability to control their own skies. The west won't do it for them, obviously. So, they need the missiles and the technology to do it themselves because, again, you can't consider any part of Ukraine safe right now while the Russians have that capability.

VAUSE: We -- I heard the sound of what was like a jet engine overhead. So just curious if we know if these five strikes, if they were missile strikes or the result of an airstrike. Do we know if which one it may have been?

BOCIURKIW: Yes. I saw -- I saw aviation as the Ukrainians call it from one of the videos as well. But normally when they do these targeted strikes on (inaudible), all of them in the past have been from a long distance away. The last one, if I'm not mistaken, being from over the Black Sea and the Azov Sea. So, either from ships or from aircraft.

So, that goes to show you how far they can strike. But I don't think the Russians would put any aviation (inaudible) revealed, but I have heard -- I mean, I was in the field just a week ago for the first time, what sounded like a Ukrainian helicopter or something like that. But generally speaking, in western Ukraine there is no aviation whatsoever.

VAUSE: Right. So missile strikes, it looks like.

BOCIURKIW: Yes.

VAUSE: We're also hearing from the regional military governor warning the population to stay here in Lviv under their -- in their shelters after that series of missile strikes, an indication that the danger, the risk is still very much real, still active.

There's some kind of, I guess discrepancy in the number of missile strikes. We're hearing from the regional military governor that it might have been four. The mayor says five targeted missile strikes hit the city. I certainly counted five. Very loud explosions after hearing that roar of an engine or some kind of jet engine overhead.

And as you say, this is all part of what appears to be an increased effort by the Russians to step up these long-range attacks, the artillery fire, the missile strikes, the air strikes, which as you say can happen pretty much at will on any part of this country.

[02:10:02]

So, the weapons that are now coming in from the United States, from the U.K., from other NATO countries, are they enough to counter the Russian ability to strike anywhere that they want in this country with these kind of missiles?

BOCIURKIW: I think there are enough, John, to lessen the number of missiles because the Ukrainians seem to have more of an ability in places like Lviv to shoot down incoming missiles, unfortunately, not as much this time. But what I'm hearing is that they're running out of missiles because they're using them very quickly.

But the main thing they need right now is the electronic surveillance capability but also the missile batteries that have lots of speed and lots of altitude because these types of missiles need to be targeted from quite a distance away.

Sorry, speed, altitude and also distance. I talked to a member of the National Guard just before I left Lviv a few days ago and he said that's the number one thing they need because that in a way, you know, gives you protection of the skies from hitting targeted areas.

But you know, it's just heartbreaking and horrifying because the other thing we have to remember is this is holy week coming up on the Julian calendar in Ukraine. So, usually it's a time of mass migration, people going to meet with families and so on.

And I think in Lviv, which is a very, very religious part of the country, believe me, is that a lot of people were hoping to celebrate more or less a normal Easter, if we can put it that way, even with these curfews. So, this will, number one, make that much more difficult.

But number two, I'm afraid that, you know, in Lviv we've had about 200,000 migrants staying there if not more. These types of strikes scare them, of course, and that may cause more migration to the borders. And that's exactly what Mr. Putin is trying to do as well, is weaponized migration, put more pressure on those European countries. It's a horrible set of circumstances.

VAUSE: Because just to recap what we can report here at this present point in time, these missile strikes appear to have hit more residential areas, which is different to March 26th, which is when a fuel depot was hit and set afire, which is different to what happened a week or so before that when a military facility between here and the Polish border was hit also.

So back then it seemed to be sort of more logistics or more military targets that they were going after. This now -- if this is in fact residential areas which have been hit, then that is an attempt to terrify the local population.

There is no other -- if there's no military point of view, no military purpose for those strikes. Then the only other reason for it is terror.

BOCIURKIW: Absolutely. This is in a way a game changer because up until now, as you correctly pointed out, Lviv has been, you know, that strikes have been limited to those let's say more strategic areas. But now that they're hitting residential neighborhoods that's, of course, an act of terror, but I think it's also a move to scare the local population.

And then on top of everything you and I have just said is that Lviv is also a humanitarian hub now. I mean, the U.N. has a big presence there. It's a big distribution hub. So, this could also disrupt that because the other thing we've had going on in the past few days even here in Kyiv is more embassies coming back, which was a good sign, another step to more normalcy. But this could change all of that in many, many different ways.

VAUSE: Yes. It does seem to be certainly a different set of circumstances around this latest attack here on Lviv. And of course the concern is what comes next. Michael Bociurkiw, thank you so much for being with us. Your time and insights very much appreciated. Thank you.

Well, the Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer says Vladimir Putin seems to have a full grasp on what is unfolding here in Ukraine. Nehammer met with the Russian president last week, the first European leader to do so since this war of choice began. He said that at the end of their meeting Putin warned him in German, "It is better the war ends earlier rather than later." Here's more now from Nehammer.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KARL NEHAMMER, AUSTRIAN CHANCELLOR: I think he is now in his own war logic, you know. He thinks the war is necessary for security guarantees for the Russian federation. He doesn't trust the international community. He blames the Ukrainians to -- for genocide -- genocide in the Donbas region. I think he believes he is winning the war.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VAUSE: CNN's Nada Bashir is live for us this hour in London. And what we're hearing from the Austrian chancellor, it does raise the question of how do you negotiate with someone who seems to be delusional if they believe they're winning this war?

NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Yes, absolutely, John. We heard from the chancellor there saying he can't fully understand Putin's war logic.

[02:14:58]

Now, he did have what he described as a frank and tough discussion with the Russian president. He said he wanted to confront him with the realities on the ground. He did of course visit Bucha where we saw those atrocities unfold, what has now been described as war crimes. He said he wanted to confront President Putin with these realities.

But as you heard there from Nehammer, Russian President Vladimir Putin believes he is winning this war. He still believes that this war is necessary in order to ensure Russia's security guarantees. That is the message we've been hearing from the Kremlin since the beginning of this invasion.

But the second key message we've been hearing from the Kremlin is that they are fighting what they've described as a genocide in the Donbas region. President Putin telling Nehammer that. He continues to reiterate this message. And that of course comes as we hear from Zelenskyy that he believes the Russian forces will be intensifying their attacks, their operations in the eastern region.

He says they completely want to finish off and destroy the Donbas region. So there is a serious concern then. Now, as you mentioned, Nehammer is one of several European leaders to have now visited Ukraine but he is the first to have sat down with President Putin.

Now, there have been numerous attempts by other European leaders, particularly French President Emmanuel Macron, to speak to Putin, to bring him to the negotiating table, to bring some sort of resolution to this conflict. But just as you said there, it is proving more and more difficult with President Putin completely pushing this by saying he doesn't trust western officials, he doesn't trust those attempts to bring some sort of resolution to this conflict. John?

VAUSE: Nada, thank you. Nada Bashir there in London. Back here in Lviv, we could now here the air raid sirens going off once more. I understand, I believe, that that could be the all clear after this city was hit by at least five missiles within the past hour or so, apparently targeting residential areas. We have yet to confirm that.

But this does appear to be the all-clear that people can now leave their bomb shelters, their safe places, that it is safe to do so. The emergency at least for now has passed. We have a lot more on this on the attack on Lviv when we come back. In the meantime, we'll take a short break.

The city of Philadelphia bringing back the mask mandate being driven by a rising number of cases. Not everyone is happy. Details on that.

Also, China reporting its first official deaths related to the current COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai. Details on that as well in just a moment. You're watching "CNN Newsroom." Back in a moment.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[02:20:00]

ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN HOST: Welcome back everyone. I'm Rosemary Church here in Atlanta. Deadly gun violence here in the U.S. has schools in Pennsylvania taking action. Pittsburgh public schools will be using a "modified lockdown" today after a weekend shooting killed two people at a party.

Police say two boys under the age of 18 died. Eight others received non-fatal gunshot injuries. And five others were injured while fleeing the scene. A search is under way for several suspects.

The city of Philadelphia is being sued over its plan to bring back its COVID mask mandate. In court documents filed Saturday, a group of business owners and residents claim the requirement goes against the state's constitution and guidelines established by the CDC.

Philadelphia would be the first major U.S. city to reinstate the mandate, assuming it takes effect as planned on Monday. The city's public health commissioner says cases have jumped in recent weeks and they're not alone. More than half of states are seeing a rise in cases. That's all the orange and red that you see there on that map. Sparking concern, Philadelphia could be a preview of what's ahead for other cities.

Well, joining me now is Dr. Scott Miskovic. He is the president and CEO of Premier Medical Group USA and a national consultant for COVID- 19 testing. Good to see you, and thank you, doctor, for all that you do.

SCOTT MISCOVICH, PRESIDENT & CEO, PREMIER MEDICAL GROUP USA: Thank you, Rosemary. Good to see you.

CHURCH: So in the coming hours, Philadelphia will become the first major U.S. City to reinstate its indoor mask mandate after reporting this sharp rise in COVID infections. And we're also seeing this rise in cases in other parts of the country. So, could more mask mandates be put in place or would perhaps hospitalizations be a better metric than cases going forward?

MISCOVICH: Wow. You nailed it with that. There is already a court challenge and there's going to be arguments because, you know, the CDC changed to that, you know, green, yellow, red guideline, which focuses on hospitalizations. I really think there will be patchy at best mask mandates across the country.

I do believe that we will probably see a preference where we have a red and blue divide where I think it's going to be hard pressed for states with election year coming up to be pressing a mask mandate regardless of how high the disease goes in some of those states. So, I commend Philadelphia, though.

When I look at what they're doing and you look at the details, they talked about the fact that a lot of their minority population suffered and that's one of the big reasons that they're making this mask mandate happen right now, because they knew it affected people in Philadelphia unfairly. So, I do commend them.

CHURCH: Though doctor, there is very little tolerance, isn't there, for wearing masks going forward. One very smart way around this imminent mask mandate in Philadelphia is for businesses, museums, et cetera, to require all occupants in each space to be vaccinated. If that happens instead, would that be a better approach given it might encourage more people to get vaccinated?

MISCOVICH: Well, you know, we've gone that way across the country and, you know, it's a push-pull. I think it's a lot easier to get people who are opposed to being forced to do anything to wear a mask than it is to have them, you know, get a shot. You know, I would tell you right now since my group across the country is still giving vaccinations --

[02:25:00]

Boy, there is not a big demand for vaccinations. You know, we had a little boost for the fourth shots going up. But I think if people at this stage have not decided to get vaccinated they're probably not going to get vaccinated. On the other hand, we should be pushing the third and fourth. Maybe we make them available more readily.

CHURCH: So what is your assessment, doctor, of where things stand with this COVID pandemic and when do you think it might end?

MISCOVICH: Well, you know, I think where we are right now its very predictable. We're watching what's going on through Europe where we're starting to see a downturn of the BA.2 omicron variant. Then just as we've seen before in all the other variants, east coast is getting hit more dramatically in the United States and then we're flowing across to some of the areas with lower vaccination rates.

So, I do believe that looking at what happened in Europe to looking what we're seeing right now in the United States, we're not going to see any major surge. I think that is very predictable. Rosemary, what we are all worried about is, you know, are we going to see a new variant being produced in the southern hemisphere's winter?

The majority of our variants have come out of the southern hemisphere winter. And that is what we're all concerned about and that is where we would have a game changer.

CHURCH: And that is certainly an understandable concern. But some suggest that it might be better while this subvariant is around and it's not as severe certainly for those non-vulnerable groups that perhaps it is better for people to expose themselves to this, which in essence offers them another booster. What would you say to that?

MISCOVICH: Boy, I think, you know, we all have come to the conclusion that herd immunity is a myth, you know. That, you know, you do get some residual immunity once you've had the infection, right? But to think that we're going to get herd immunity by having so many people get the disease.

You know, there is a great study that came out that showed that Sweden went that route and it just didn't work relative to its two other Scandinavian neighbors. So, from my perspective, the best defense is to get your vaccination. The second best defense is wear your mask and, you know, avoid COVID if you are at high risk.

Because remember, we have that other little thing lurking and that's called waning immunity. If you've only had two shots, you're very much going to be at risk. You're probably barely 20 percent protected if you've only had two shots.

So, we still have some concerns ahead but we are way better off, Rosemary, than you and I have been talking for 18, 20-plus months. Much brighter future right now.

CHURCH: Yes. You offer such great advice as always. Dr. Scott Miscovich, thank you so much. Appreciate it.

MISCOVICH: Thank you, Rosemary.

CHURCH: Well, in China, officials say three people in Shanghai have died from COVID-19. It is the first official announcement of deaths in the city since Shanghai entered a strict COVID lockdown in March. More than 23,000 new cases were reported across China on Sunday and almost all of them were in Shanghai.

South Korea lifts most of its COVID-19 restrictions starting today. Curfews for businesses, caps on private gatherings and rallies and restrictions on religious activities have ended after more than two years. Indoor and outdoor mask wearing will remain mandatory, but officials say other restrictions will be lifted if cases continue to decrease and medical system capacities remain stable.

Well, still to come, Ukraine's president speaks exclusively with CNN and says he thinks his U.S. counterpart will visit his country. We will hear from Volodymyr Zelenskyy. That's next.

And the impact of sanctions coming up. A look at the price Russians are paying for President Vladimir Putin's war. We're back in just a moment.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[02:32:54]

VAUSE: Welcome back everybody. 30 minutes past the hour. I'm John Vause live in Lviv in Ukraine. And columns of smoke are rising from multiple locations around the city, the result of at least five Russian missile strikes within the past hour or so. It's not entirely clear which areas were targeted. But there are indications that it was perhaps residential areas.

This is the first time in three weeks that Lviv has come under fire by the Russian military. Back then on, March 26, it was a field depo that was hit. A few days before that, it was a military facility that was hit between Lviv and the Polish border. If this is in fact residential areas, which have been the targets here that would indicate a significant shift in tactics by the Russians, because this city has been mostly spared the worst of the Russian aggression until now.

We are still waiting to find out if there are casualties, if anybody has been hurt. But we are told by the mayor that emergency crews are now on the scene of those missile strikes. As soon as we have more details on the extent of the damage, what was targeted, the number of casualties, the number of dead, we will bring it to you. We've also learned of at least two missile strikes in Dnipro in central Ukraine. The region's military government says two people were injured, some railway infrastructure was destroyed. And a White House official says shipments from the latest U.S. security assistance package to Ukraine have started to arrive in country as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warns of incoming Russian offensive in the eastern part of Ukraine. He sat down for an exclusive interview with CNN's Jake Tapper.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: Do you want President Biden to come here?

VOLODYMY ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: Yes.

TAPPER: Are there other any plans for him to come?

ZELENSKYY: I think you will.

TAPPER: You think he will.

ZELENSKYY: I think you will. And I think he -- but it's not -- it's his decision, of course. And about the safety situation, t depends. I mean, that -- but I think -- I think he's the leader of United States and then that's why he should come here to see.

TAPPER: President Biden just agreed to another $800 million in military aid for Ukraine, bringing the total American contribution to $2.5 billion. Are you satisfied with that? Do you need more?

[02:35:09]

ZELENSKYY (through translator): Of course, we need more. But I am happy that he is helping us now. I feel that right now we are having a cleaner dialogue. It's just been a dialogue that's had some twists and turns. And not just talk. It's been very, very difficult because there aren't many countries that have really helped us. The assistance from the United States led by President Biden and they are doing it again today. But there will never be enough. Enough isn't possible.

There is a full-scale war ongoing today. So, we still need a lot more than what we have today. Unfortunately, we do not have a technical advantages over our enemy. We're just not on the same level there. But our people are stronger. That's our main advantage. And we know our mission, our objective, what we're fighting for. We're defending our country with all these families and the kids that we discussed before.

We know what we stand for and from where we get our strength. But Biden's confirmed $800 million in support. What's most importantly, is speed.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VAUSE: President Zelenskyy there speaking to CNN's Jake Tapper. Meantime, international sanctions appear to be taking a toll on Russians. Even if one Moscow politician insists nothing in his life has changed. And economic contraction is expected. A major recession also seems likely. Here's ITN's Carl Dinnen with our report.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

CARL DINNEN, ITV NEWS REPORTER: It's not just the oligarchs, ordinary Russians are also finding their lives disrupted by sanctions. Diera (ph) rents a small apartment. She was about to buy her own place, but then interest rates hit 20 percent. And along with everything else, the price of dog food is going up.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): More luxury products not everyday necessities have risen in price by about 30 percent. Everything else, bread, milk, eggs, potatoes, fruits and vegetables have increased by about 10 to 15 percent.

DINNEN: Who do you hold responsible for the economic problems that Russia faces?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The people responsible for these economic problems are the people who impose the sanctions. Our government is responsible for the fact we didn't properly find substitutes for foreign products. We should pay more attention to this now.

DINNEN: Those who are closer to the center of power talk tough on sanctions. Pyotr Tolstoy, deputy chairman of the Duma is himself under sanction.

PYOTR TALSTOY, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN, STATE DUMA (through translator): I'm under E.U. sanctions. I'm under British sanctions. Under U.S. sanctions and under Japanese sanctions. And you know what, nothing has changed. I have a Japanese car, a Toyota. Probably I should sell it in retaliation. That's all. Nothing else has changed in my life, I assure you.

DINNEN: In downtown Moscow, international designers have shut up shop. Temporarily they say and for what the signs on their doors euphemistically call technical reasons.

DINNEN (on camera): More than 600 global companies have voluntarily withdrawn from the Russian market and whole or in part, and economists are expecting a 10 to 15 percent contraction in the Russian economy. Potentially the sharpest recession since the days of the Soviet Union.

DINNEN (voice over): So far, Russia's central bank has managed to prop up the ruble and alleviate some of the initial financial shock. But the Russian economy is heading for a difficult place. Whether that has an impact on Russia's actions in Ukraine is another question. Carl Dinnen, ITV News, Moscow.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

VAUSE: Time for a short break. When we come back. Regional concerns on the agenda for U.S. and South Korean envoys. We'll have details on their meetings as North Korea steps off its missile launches.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[02:42:55]

ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: The death toll from devastating floods in eastern South Africa has risen. Officials from the KwaZulu-Natal province say 443 people lost their lives in flooding from one of the worst storm systems ever to hit the area. At least 63 people are still missing. Officials say housing on steep slopes and bridges in low lying areas are still at risk of further damage.

South Korea and the United States will conduct military exercises for the next nine days. Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff announced the plan on Sunday. The Defense Command Post training will use computer simulation without actual military forces training in person. The Joint Chief said the decision to go virtual was made based on conditions such as COVID-19 and maintenance of the combined defense posture.

Well, that's as the U.S. envoy for North Korea arrives in Seoul for talks on Pyongyang's missile launchers. Paula Hancocks is there and joins us live with the details. Good to see you, Paula. So, what will likely come out of those discussions on North Korea's missile launches?

PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Rosemary, we know as you say that the special envoy Sung Kim is here in Seoul. He'll be meeting many officials over the next couple of days. And clearly there is plenty to talk about when you consider what Pyongyang has been doing over recent months. January was a record month for number of missile launches.

Just last week, you had a significant anniversary in Pyongyang with the 110th anniversary of the birth of the country's founder. Kim Jong- un's grandfather Kim Il-sung. Now we have in recent weeks also had an intercontinental ballistic missile launch from North Korea. So, there's a definite increase in the amount of activity from North Korea, the amount of launches, the amount of testing that has been going on and that is of concern to Seoul, to Tokyo, to Washington. And that will be one of the top topics when they are meeting.

[02:45:01]

HANCOCKS: Of course, this is a very busy time of year as well on any particular year because of those U.S.-South Korean military drills. Even if there are computers simulations, they would still irritate Pyongyang. And we have seen that in recent years and experts are saying that there will potentially be more testing, given the fact that the timing and the environment is quite positive for testing for North Korea.

The world is looking elsewhere. The United States is focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. So, potentially that could work in Kim Jong-un's favor. The fact that any U.N. Security Council meeting is not going to be speaking in unison, Russia and China are highly unlikely to be agreeing with the United States when pushing for more sanctions against North Korea if they are continuing to test.

So, that does play into Pyongyang's favor. Many experts and observers you speak to as well will say that they believe a nuclear test. The seventh nuclear test for North Korea could be imminent, could be in the next few months. And we have seen satellite images showing there is activity at their testing site. Rosemary?

CROWLEY: All right. Paula Hancocks, joining us live from Seoul. Many thanks.

It's a presence that isn't going unnoticed. Coming up. The concerns over Chinese warships being spotted around contested islands near Japan and Taiwan. We're back with that in just a moment.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[02:50:21]

CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. Well, there's growing concern in Japan about the increased appearance of Chinese ships around a chain of contested islands. This amid heightened tensions between China and Taiwan, and fears Beijing could be inspired by Russia's war on Ukraine to launch its own attack. As the political rhetoric heats up, Japanese fishermen are worried about their way of life. Blake Essig has our report.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

BLAKE ESSIG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Surrounded by nature, a dramatic coastline in seemingly endless beauty. Life here on Japan's westernmost Island is simple. But with each new day, the future of this quiet island paradise where fishing as life becomes more uncertain.

ESSIG (on camera): From where I'm walking on the shores of Japan's Yonaguni Island, the East Coast of Taiwan is only 110 kilometers away. It's so close that on a clear day, you can actually see it. It's this stretch of water. It's been viewed as a potential battleground if China invades Taiwan.

ESSIG (voice over): For the past 25 years, Kazushi Kinjo has made a living fishing the waters surrounding Japan's Nansei islands. It includes the uninhabited group of islands known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. We started, Kinjo says, he never saw Chinese ships. But in the last few years, dangerous encounters specifically around the Senkaku Islands are guaranteed.

KAZUSHI KINJO, FISHERMAN (through translator): You can see it in the video. The bow of one of their ships was pointed straight at us. And they were chasing us.

ESSIG: This video, he says, is from his first confrontation with the Chinese coast guard back in 2018.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know for sure. But I also saw what looked like cannons. Looking back, they definitely could have shot at us if they'd wanted to. I felt that fear.

ESSIG: In response to CNN, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says it's carrying out law enforcement duties in its territory. But it's not just the Chinese Coast Guard trolling these contested waters.

ESSIG (on camera): There are about 160 troops based at this coastal surveillance station inside camp Yonaguni within eyesight of Taiwan. And since last summer, what they've likely see.

ESSIG (voice over): Are Chinese warships routinely patrolling Japanese territorial waters in the waters north and east of Taiwan. That's according to Japanese and senior U.S. defense officials.

It's a presence that the Japanese government says has steadily increased every year for more than two decades. And it's not just at sea. In roughly the past two years, the number of times Japan has been forced to scrambled fighter jets because of China threatening its airspace has nearly doubled. An escalation in the air and its sea. That one of the men in charge with defending Japan says is increasing tensions.

GEN. YOSHIHIDE YOSHIDA, CHIEF OF STAFF, JAPANESE GROUND SELF-DEFENSE FORCE (through translator): We cannot easily speculate over their intentions, but we are concerned about it as it is a very provocative act.

ESSIG: Well, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to CNN saying those comments are wholly fabricated and malicious hype. General Yoshihide Yoshida says, it's that increased activity. The ongoing nuclear threat posed by North Korea and a growing fear that China may try to take control of land that the Japanese government claims is inherently theirs. That makes defending the strategically important Nansei islands a top priority.

YOSHIDA: Japan's territorial sovereignty extends to the Nansei islands. And I'm afraid that may be infringed in the future.

ESSIG: The Nansei islands consist of these 198 islands stretching about 1200 kilometers. Since 2016, in a clear departure from Japan's post World War II pacifism, Japan's self defense force has increased its footprint. Building bases on Amami Oshima, Miyako-jima and Yonaguni. Ishigaki is next.

ESSIG (on camera): Around this time next year, hundreds of troops and several missile defense systems will be deployed here on Ishigaki. And when that happens, this will become Japan's fourth missile armed island located in the East China Sea.

ESSIG (voice over): Despite Japan's increased spending on defense and continued militarization of the Nansei islands, some security experts say Japan remains vulnerable in part because it currently has no long- range strike capability.

ESSIG (on camera): How confident are you in Japan's ability to defend itself?

YOSHIDA: We are enhancing our capabilities, but our competitors are all also enhancing their capabilities at an extremely fast pace.

[02:55:03] YOSHIDA: It will be very difficult to maintain our deterrence and response capabilities unless we further increase our military capacity.

ESSIG: Through drills like this, Japan's self-defense forces are constantly preparing to respond to hostile forces whether it's during the day or at night. That includes threats from China, North Korea and Russia that military officials say has created one of the most alarming security environments surrounding Japan since shortly after the end of World War II.

Back on Yonaguni, the Russian invasion of Ukraine sparking fears that China could be emboldened to act off Japan's shores.

KINJO: The people are terrified of the situation that's happening. I think that the Senkaku issue and the Taiwan contingency are similar to the Ukranian issue. I have a strong sense of crisis that this island will eventually cease to be Japan.

ESSIG (voice over): But in the face of geopolitical concerns well out of his control, Kinjo and his crew do what they know. They prepare for another day at sea.

ESSIG (on camera): Conflict here in Yonaguni isn't necessarily imminent, but China's constant presence off the coast and the possibility of war has many people living here worried. Wondering about their future. Blake Essig, CNN, Yonaguni, Japan

Austria is now also considering Mario Draghi's proposal. Germany so far still against

Tobias Kaiser

Brussels

In the European Union, the discussion about gas sanctions light is picking up speed. Italy and other southern European countries are promoting a price cap on Russian gas supplies as a possible alternative to a complete import freeze.

Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi had said in an interview over the weekend that more and more of the 27 EU member states supported his proposal for a price cap on Russian gas. The former president of the European Central Bank (ECB) has proposed that EU states pay less money for Russian gas than Russia demands as a weakened form of sanction. The EU states should set such a price cap, and Russian gas customers in the EU would then be obliged to pay only this price at most to Russian suppliers.

So far, Germany and Austria in particular have opposed these plans. Opponents of a price cap warn that Russia's President Vladimir Putin could react by completely cutting off supplies and turning off the gas tap to Europe.

Proponents of the gas price cap point out that it would achieve two goals at once: Russia would collect less money and European consumers could be relieved of gas and electricity prices without affecting gas supplies in the EU.

Proponents of the idea argue that the EU has the necessary buying power over Russia to enforce the forced price cuts. Nearly three-quarters of Russia's natural gas exports flowed to European countries last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Energy Statistics. Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, EU countries have paid more than 36 billion euros for oil, gas and coal from Russia. Moreover, Russia cannot find alternative customers for supplies to Europe in the short term. Because natural gas is mainly delivered through pipelines, the gas can only flow to where the pipelines lead. Putin does want to sell more gas to Asia in the future and has agreed additional supplies with Chinese President Xi Jinping, for example. But this will require new pipelines. In the production of liquefied gas, which can be shipped by ship, Russia is currently lagging far behind its rivals.

Despite the EU's market power, the proposal for a price cap is controversial. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, for example, is among the supporters of a gas price cap. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo has also come out in favor. Other EU countries, however, are more skeptical. Germany and Austria in particular had previously warned against such market intervention. In the debate, both countries have so far also been firmly opposed to a complete oil and gas embargo against Russia.

The dispute will be a topic at the next summit of EU leaders on May 30-31. The issue will be discussed "at the next European Council on the basis of a more general document that the Commission is preparing," Draghi said over the weekend. Until then, the European Commission wants to explore options for alternative sanctions. These include not only a gas price cap, but also a tariff on Russian energy imports or a requirement that payments for Russian gas supplies be paid into an escrow account rather than to Russian suppliers.

The example of Austria shows how quickly attitudes falter. The government in Vienna had previously rejected capped gas prices even within the EU. Now, however, there seems to be some movement on the issue. The Austrian government, which is examining the possibility of a gas price cap in the EU favorably, said Austria's Finance Minister Magnus Brunner to WELT.

"In principle, we see too much market intervention as counterproductive, as it leads to undesirable side effects, as has been seen in the past in the area of fuel prices," the politician said. "However, we are open to discussing constructive proposals that help actually relieve the burden on people." Brunner's announcement shows how quickly the discussion can change in the current situation. The next few weeks will show whether this also applies to the debate on gas sanctions against Russia.

In principle, we see too much market intervention as counterproductive Magnus Brunner, Austria's Finance Minister

Iran says 'technical issues' in nuclear talks complete

Iran said Wednesday that "technical issues" in the now-paused negotiations to restore its 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers have been resolved, but "political" issues persist ahead of concluding any deal.

Iran has been engaged for a year in negotiations with France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China directly, and the United States indirectly, to revive the 2015 deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

The US unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran, prompting Tehran to step back from nuclear commitments.

Negotiations in the Austrian capital Vienna aim to return the US to the deal, including through Washington lifting sanctions, and to ensure Tehran's full compliance with its commitments.

"Technical issues and discussions in the Vienna talks have been completed," Mohammad Eslami, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA.

"Only political issues remain," he added.

Foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said early this month that Iran will only return to Vienna to finalise an agreement, not to hold new negotiations.

The talks have been paused since March 11 after Russia demanded guarantees that Western sanctions imposed against Moscow after its February 24 invasion of Ukraine would not damage its trade with Iran.

Days later, Moscow said it had received the necessary guarantees.

Among the key remaining sticking points is Tehran's demand to delist the Revolutionary Guards, the ideological arm of Iran's military, from a US terror list.

That sanction, imposed by former US president Donald Trump after he withdrew from the nuclear agreement, is officially separate from the atomic file.

"If Iran wants sanctions-lifting that goes beyond the JCPOA, they'll need to address concerns of ours that go beyond the JCPOA," US State Department spokesman Ned Price said Monday.

The 2015 agreement gave Iran sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme to guarantee that Tehran could not develop a nuclear weapon -- something it has always denied wanting to do.

Ukraine and EU accession: Ambassador seeks talks with Austria

Vienna - Ukrainian Ambassador to Austria, Vasyl Khymynets, is "very disappointed" with statements by Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg of conservative People's Party (VP). As he told journalists in Vienna on Monday evening, Ukraine wants "further constructive talks" with Austria. "We firmly believe that Ukraine deserves EU candidate status." Specifically, Khymynets is hoping for status in June. "Ukraine needs the EU just as the EU needs Ukraine."

At the media forum in Lech, Schallenberg thought aloud about "tailor-made offers for the closest possible connection between Ukraine" and the EU. The Ukraine belongs to Europe and to the West, said Schallenberg on Saturday. But he added: "Can this only work through full membership of the EU? I don't think so." The Foreign Minister explained his reluctance by saying that the Western Balkans should not be forgotten.

Alternatives to EU accession and reference to other countries are not permitted for the ambassador. He is concerned with recognizing the merits of Ukraine. His country has already implemented more than 60 percent of the preliminary stage of the accession treaty, the association agreement with the EU . There has also been a lot of progress in free trade and the fight against corruption. Joining the Union is the goal of the Ukrainian people: the EU is supported by almost 90 percent of Ukrainians, Khymynets stressed. Ukraine has long positioned itself clearly pro-European. Khymynets already described the Orange Revolution in 2004 as a "strong expression of the will to the EU".

But Ukraine's accession would also have advantages for the EU, the ambassador explained. The "democracy space" in Europe would be expanded. The EU would also benefit from the "rapid development" of the information technology sector or hydrogen production. Ukraine is already involved in many political EU initiatives, in particular the Green Deal and the digital market. Ukraine is a reliable partner of the EU in international affairs, supporting 93 percent of EU statements on international developments and approaches to their regulation.

Ukraine also "plays a major role" in the food supply. The Ukrainian market is large, the people are well trained "in some areas at a better level than in Austria". After his arrival as ambassador in October, Khymynets had, in many discussions with Austrian business representatives, heard strong interest in expanding their production in Ukraine or in new investments. Austria is one of the sixth largest investors in Ukraine. He was therefore "firmly convinced that the Austrian economy will clearly be among the greatest beneficiaries of Ukraine's EU membership," emphasized the ambassador.

Aside from supporting Kiev's EU ambitions, Khymynets expects Austria to endorse an oil embargo as another EU sanction against Russia. For Ukraine it seems clear that neutral Austria will not deliver any weapons. "We still need Austrian aid transports. The extent of the destruction is enormous, many people are starving." Fire engines and ambulances would be needed. Austria can also help with the reconstruction of Ukraine after the Russian war of aggression. It is also important that the mood of the Austrian population towards the Ukrainian war expellees remains positive, said the ambassador. About 60,000 Ukrainians are registered in Austria.

Tusk accuses Austria of paying for Russian gas in rubles

Vienna - The leader of the European People's Party (EPP), Donald Tusk, accuses Austria, Hungary and Germany of going into the "ruble zone" to pay for Russian gas. This was reported by the Spanish news agency Europa Press on Wednesday. The former EU Council President and former Polish Prime Minister criticized that these countries are prepared to pay for Russian gas supplies in rubles, as Moscow is demanding.

"I heard that not only Hungary, but also Austria and Germany are ready to pay for Russian gas in rubles," Tusk wrote in a social media statement. "Are you still in the euro zone or in the ruble zone?" he quipped after Russia stopped supplying gas to Poland and Bulgaria. They had refused to pay in rubles. Poland's Environment Minister Anna Moskwa also criticized Germany, Austria and Hungary on Polish television and called for "consequences" for these countries.

With their allegations, the Polish politicians are apparently referring to media reports that the German energy supplier Uniper, for example, but also the Austrian OMV want to make their payments for Russian gas in euros in the future, but on their own accounts at Gazprombank, where the euro payments are made then be immediately converted into rubles. For example, the "Financial Times" reported on Thursday, citing unnamed sources, that OMV wanted to open a ruble account with Gazprombank in Switzerland to pay for Russian gas supplies.

Against the background of sanctions against the country, Russia will in future demand payment of gas bills in rubles. However, the new payment terms proposed by Russia provide for the possibility of depositing the money at Gazprombank in euros and then converting it into rubles.

Austria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer of conservative People's Party (VP) said on Wednesday that gas deliveries to Austria would flow without restrictions and that OMV would continue to pay in euros. According to Nehammer, OMV has accepted the Russian conditions. An OMV spokesman did not want to go that far today in a statement to the APA. Gazprom's proposal was received and checked and a sanction-compliant solution is being worked on, it said.

Eni and Uniper also rumoured to be ready to accept Russia's terms

EC threatens to sanction companies that open ruble accounts

Reportedly, ten companies already opened such accounts, four paid in rubles

Austria's OMV denied reports it intends to pay for gas in rubles. This is in line with the Wednesday statement of Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer, who said that Vienna will continue to pay for gas in euros. Nevertheless, earlier on Thursday, the FT reported that Austria's OMV, Germany's Uniper as well as companies from Hungary and Slovakia are preparing to open ruble accounts at Gazmprombank as envisaged by the gas payment scheme proposed by Moscow. Bloomberg reported that Italy's Eni also has such intentions. Uniper also said it will continue to pay in euros, but is in discussions with Gazprom over "specific payment modalities". The energy supplier is coordinating its position with the German government, its spokesperson said. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that Gazprombank rejected ruble payments from a trading firm Berlin seized from Gazprom's German subsidiary as part of its efforts to secure gas deliveries. The trading firm is currently in talks with Gazprom, hoping to get approval for the transaction, according to sources. On Wednesday, Bloomberg informed that ten European companies opened the accounts at Gazprombank required to pay according to the scheme proposed by Moscow and four already paid in rubles.

On Wednesday, Gazprom announced that it stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria because of the payment deadlines and would resume when it receives ruble payments. Reportedly, several member countries called for clearer guidance from the EC on the matter behind closed doors. EC head Ursula von der Leyen called on EU companies not to succumb to Putin's demands as this would violate the sanctions regime. On Thursday, the FT quoted EU official that opening second ruble account is sanctions breach. Meanwhile, EC spokesman Eric Mamer informed that the EC could launch legal procedure against EU members which refuse to comply with the sanctions.

Gas suppliers in Germany 'are preparing to pay Putin in roubles'

WAR IN UKRAINE

GAS companies in countries including Germany and Austria appear to have bowed to Vladimir Putin's 'blackmail' bid over energy supplies, it emerged last night.

In a disturbing development, several European gas distributors have indicated they will accept his demand that they pay for hydrocarbons in Russian currency.

Paying in roubles is banned under economic sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.

But according to reports, companies in Germany, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia intend to circumnavigate these rules.

Such a practice would bolster Russia's finances which have been hit by sanctions and the cost of the continuing war. It would also demonstrate the effectiveness of president Putin's bid to exploit continental Europe's reliance on Russian gas.

The companies intend to open rouble accounts at Gazprombank in

Switzerland. The bank would accept their payments in euros to ensure they do not breach sanctions.

But the bank, which is not subject to EU sanctions, would then convert these payments into roubles for onward payment to Russia.

Negotiations between buyers and Gazprom, the Russian state-controlled gas supplier, were understood to have intensified last night as the payment deadline approached.

The companies involved include two of Europe's largest Russian gas importers, German-based Uniper and Austrian-based OMV. An Italian company, Eni, is apparently considering its options ahead of its next payment for Russian gas which is due next month.

In March, Putin decreed gas buyers from 'hostile states' - those opposed to his 'special military operation' - had to use this method to pay for their supplies.

The practice will guarantee Russia's access to billions of roubles to suppresident port its economy and pay for its military operations. Since the decree was issued, the European Commission has struggled to counter the demands given the huge reliance on Russian hydrocarbons across the continent.

Gas importers in Poland and Bulgaria, which have refused to sign up to the Kremlin scheme, had gas supplies halted by Russia on Wednesday, a decision European Commission

Ursula von der Leyen, called 'blackmail'.

The commission's advisers have concluded any move to sanction Gazprombank - which would be the swiftest way of closing the loophole - could jeopardise the entire existing payment mechanism for Russian gas, resulting in a catastrophic cessation of shipments to the bloc.

Valdis Dombrovskis, commission executive vice-president, told The Financial Times it was primarily up to the individual companies that had signed the contracts with Gazprom to implement and interpret them. But he urged them to stick to the letter of these contracts.

OMV said it had analysed the Gazprom request in light of EU sanctions and was working on a sanctions-compliant solution.

Tiina Tuomela, chief financial officer of Uniper, said: 'We consider that the amendment of the payment process complies with the sanctions law and so the payments are possible.'

Fallen city told to use currency

THE occupied area of Kherson will start using the Russian rouble from Sunday as Moscow tightens its grip on the region.

An official from a pro-Russian committee which styles itself as the region's 'military-civil administration' announced the move via Russian news agency RIA.

Kirill Stremousov said the transition to the rouble will take up to four months, during which time it will circulate alongside Ukraine's official currency, the hryvnia. This week Russia said it had gained full control of the southern region.

Russia appointed its own mayor in the city of Kherson on Tuesday after taking over regional headquarters. But Ukrainian mayor Ihor Kolykhayev said on Facebook he had defied Russian orders.

'I am staying in Kherson with the people of Kherson who entrusted me with the management of our city,' he added.

Uncertainty about sanction-compliance of Russian gas payments

Vienna - It was still unclear, in which form the Austrian oil and gas company OMV will pay for Russian gas. This was according to OMV head Alfred Stern. There was great uncertainty about the sanction compliance, he stated. The Russian state-owned company Gazprom had established new payment terms and now asks for payment of its gas supply in Russian rouble.

Currently OMV pays Gazprom in euros, as is stated in the existing contract. The payments in rouble requested by Gazprom are currently being analysed and sanction-compliant and legally compliant solutions are being elaborated, Stern stated.

Apparently, a possibility is currently being discussed in several countries that would allow both Russia and the EU to save face. According to this, gas customers in the EU could pay in euros, the money would be immediately exchanged into roubles by Gazprombank and Gazprom would receive roubles as demanded.

In March Russian President Vladimir Putin announced to only accept Russian roubles as payment for Russian gas for EU countries and "unfriendly countries". After Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the end of February, the rouble's exchange rate crashed.

The announced renunciation by several EU countries from Russian gas was not as easy as sometimes depicted on political level. There were legal hurdles and economic issues, the OMV head said.

Primarily due to the currently high gas prices, OMV strongly increased both its revenue and operating profit in the first quarter of 2022. Revenues rose by 146 percent to 15.8 billion euros. The operating profit before special effects, adjusted for inventory effects, tripled from 870 million to 2.62 billion euros.

Austria's OMV developing 'sanctionscompliant' payment solutions for Russian gas: CEO

**Fast moving situation regarding ruble payment mechanism

**Next OMV invoice for Russian gas supply due in May: Stern

**Gas supply contract honored, nominated imports delivered

Austria's OMV is still working to develop solutions to pay for Russian gas that are "sanctions-compliant," CEO Alfred Stern said April 29, with its next payment to state-controlled Gazprom due in May.

Stern, speaking following the release of OMV's first-quarter earnings, said it was a fast-moving situation and the company remained in discussion on the issue with multiple stakeholders.

"We have received a request from Gazprom about payment methods. What we are now doing is analyzing this and developing solutions that are sanctions-compliant," Stern said.

"OMV will be compliant with every sanction and regulatory environment that is in place," he said.

Concerns that Russian gas deliveries to Europe could be impacted by the request for payment in rubles has kept European gas prices at sustained highs since late March.

Fears were compounded by the cut-off of Russian supply to Poland and Bulgaria on April 27 over a refusal to pay in rubles.

The TTF month-ahead price jumped 8% to Eur105.50/MWh ($111.55/MWh) on April 27, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights data, before falling back to Eur99.50/MWh on April 28.

GAZPROMBANK ACCOUNT

Stern declined to address directly a question on whether OMV was setting up a new account with a Switzerland-based subsidiary of Gazprombank to comply with the new Russian decree on ruble payments.

Stern said it was a "quickly developing situation with information coming from different places."

"We are in contact with multiple stakeholders on this," he said, adding that OMV paid its Gazprom invoices on a monthly basis. "So, the next one will happen in May."

OMV imports Russian gas into Austria under a long-term contract with Gazprom that runs until 2040, and also buys Russian gas for delivery into Germany.

Stern said that up to now, its gas contracts were being honored. "All our nominated volumes are being delivered," he said.

For the full year 2021, OMV imported an average of 7.34 TWh/month (0.7 Bcm/month) of gas under its long-term supply agreements with Gazprom for delivery to both Germany and Austria.

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a new decree March 31 requiring EU buyers to pay in rubles for Russian gas via a new currency conversion mechanism or risk having supplies suspended.

Gazprom sent its European counterparties a notice regarding the terms of the new payment scheme on April 1.

Under the new rules, European buyers would be required to transfer funds in euros or dollars to a new Russian account at Gazprombank, from which payments would be made to Gazprom in rubles after conversion.

YUZHNO-RUSSKOYE STAKE

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, OMV in early March said it was reevaluating its engagement in Russia and said it was considering exiting its near 25% stake in the Yuzhno-Russkoye gas field in West Siberia.

"We are looking at how we can further proceed," Stern said. "It is correct to say the sanction environment is highly volatile and very difficult to predict."

He said that for its business in Russia, OMV has local business accounts kept in rubles to pay for rent and other activities, but that these had nothing to do with gas supply payments.

OMV has also moved to stop including production from Yuzhno-Russkoye in its accounts.

OMV's share of Yuzhno-Russkoye production was some 100,000 b/d of oil equivalent last year, but this was expected to decline.

By 2025, OMV's share of production was set to fall to 80,000 boe/d and further to 40,000 boe/d by 2030.

"From a long-term perspective, it doesn't have such a big influence," Stern said.

Speaking about the gas market more generally, Stern said there was still strong demand and tight supply, with OMV expecting an average realized gas price of about Eur45/MWh in 2022.

He said what can drive prices are "emotional, psychological effects" to do with uncertainty connected to "what might happen next."

"In the past month, different announcements and events in the market have led to price spikes, and I would believe this volatility continues to prevail."

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

ANNOUNCER (voice-over): This is "CNN Breaking News."

ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hello and welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Isa Soares live in Ukraine. Russia attacks the Ukrainian capital. The timing likely aimed to send a clear message.

MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: And I'm Michael Holmes at CNN world headquarters in Atlanta. I will have our other top stories, including Amazon stock plunging after reporting a nearly $4 billion loss.

SOARES: Welcome to the show, everyone. It is 9:00 here in Lviv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russian strikes on Kyiv that happened while the U.N. secretary general was in the capital must be met with a strong response.

Ukraine's Emergency Service says one missile hit an apartment building, setting it on fire. Authorities say 10 people were injured.

Mr. Zelenskyy says that attack took place right after he finished meeting with the U.N. chief, who wasn't harmed. While standing alongside the Ukrainian president, Guterres pledged to do all he can to achieve peace. Have a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL: This war must end, and peace must be established in line with the charter of the United Nations and international law. Many leaders have made many good efforts to stop the fighting, but these efforts, so far, have not succeeded. And I'm here to say to you, Mr. President and to the people of Ukraine, we will not give up.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

SOARES: Meantime, the U.S. says Russia isn't making much headway in its renewed offensive in the east, with a senior U.S. defense official calling Moscow's progress slow as well as an evening. This, of course, as President Zelenskyy says 10 Russian servicemen have now been identified as suspects in crimes committed in Bucha. That is the Kyiv suburbs where scores of civilians, remember, were found dead after Russian forces pulled out. Mr. Zelenskyy is vowing to hold those responsible accountable.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): We know all the details about them and their actions, and we will find everyone just as we will find all the other Russian thugs who killed and tortured Ukrainians, who tormented our people, who destroyed houses and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

SOARES: I want to take you now to a town in Southern Ukraine that is bracing for a Russian assault. Its residents say Russian tanks are positioned just a kilometer away from their homes. They have been testing Ukrainian defenders who still control the town. Nick Paton Walsh was there for you.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR (voice-over): If Moscow had any surprises left in this war, it is along here. The other side of the river has been Russia's for weeks. But here, the western side is caught in the fast-changing landscape of this week's push.

(On camera): That's the prize over there, the Dnipro River, up past which on the left side bank here the Russians are trying to push, wanting control of both sides of the vital part of Ukraine.

(Voice-over): Here in Novovorontsovka, we are told there are a handful of Russian tanks just over a kilometer away on its outskirts. Pushing, probing, but ultimately kept at bay by Ukrainian forces that still hold the town.

Resilience here embodied under the threat of rocket fire, planting onions.

(On camera): I'm here until victory, she said. Children have gone. It's just her and her mother. Her 80-year-old mother and her are staying here. Her mother says she's not going anywhere and she's not going to leave her alone. All her windows are blown out, she says.

(Voice-over): Ukrainian forces who don't want their positions filmed are dotted around the town, as too are the signs of innocent lives lost here. Rock peeking out from under the water. This boat in which 14 civilians tried to flee Russian occupation on April the 7th, four of them died when Moscow's troops opened fire when it was 70 meters out.

Yet still, the desperate keep fleeing. This morning, these women left behind their men to defend their homes near Novovorontsovka.

We ran, ran early in the morning, said Luda. They didn't let us out.

[02:05:00]

PATON WALSH (voice-over): We're shields for them. They didn't let us out. By foot and by bicycle, we go. In the fields, we ran.

Our soldiers were two kilometers away, Nadezha adds, and we ran to them. The Russian tanks, she said, take cars. They draw ads (ph) on everything. As their new unwanted guests demanded milk and food at gunpoint, they had a glimpse of their warped mindset. They say they've come to liberate us, Luda said, these aggressors. That's what they told us. They say America is fighting here but using the hands of Ukrainians to do it. That's what they say.

Another claimed to be fueled by the violence of the long war, the separatists in the east. In general, the Donetsk militants say, she said, you have been bombing us for eight years, now we bomb you. Across the fields, loading and artillery swallow whole once-happy worlds.

Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Novovorontsovka, Ukraine.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

SOARES: Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is urging a solution to what he calls a crisis within a crisis in Ukraine. On Thursday, he called for opening of humanitarian corridors to get civilians out, of course, of the Azovstal steel plant in the besieged city of Mariupol.

Guterres spoke in Kyiv two days after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. According to Guterres, Mr. Putin agreed in principle to allow civilians to evacuate. U.N. chief says they face a life-or-death situation inside the besieged plant.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

GUTERRES: Mariupol is a crisis within a crisis. Thousands of civilians need lifesaving assistance. Many are elderly, in need of medical care or have limited mobility. They need an escape route out of the apocalypse.

ZELENSKYY (through translator): Ukraine is ready to have immediate negotiations on the evacuation of people from Azovstal, as well as to ensure the implementation of any agreement reached. We hope there will be a humanely attitude towards those people on the part of Russia. We believe part of the mission of the U.N. secretary general would be effective, and we are ready to support this in whatever matter is possible.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

SOARES: Well, regardless of how the situation in Mariupol plays out, Ukraine is already creating really the fastest growing refugee crisis since World War II.

The U.N. says more than 5.3 million Ukrainians have fled the country since the invasion began, and that includes almost three million who went to Poland alone. On top of that, as you can see there on your screen, more than seven million, 7.7 million are internally displaced in Ukraine.

For more now on all of this, I'm joined now by a familiar face on the show. Toby Fricker is the chief of communications for UNICEF. Toby, thank you very much for joining us here.

Last time you and I spoke, I think you were in Zaporizhzhia, right? You were talking -- you and I were talking about the need for evacuations and for humanitarian corridors. We saw the U.N. chief, Antonio Guterres, here just yesterday, and we were expecting some sort of deliverables on that. Are you disappointed that that hasn't come yet?

TOBY FRICKER, SPOKESPERSON, UNICEF: We all hope that there are going to be some deliverables. We hope that children, women, civilians can get out of Mariupol. We know that the situation is horrific. We are very hopeful that that will still happen. Secretary General and others have been discussing with all sides.

We believe that a corridor can still be achieved and we can get people out safely because it is urgent. Children are going through horrific time in Mariupol. But also, in other areas --

SOARES: Yeah.

FRICKER: -- across where there is heavy fighting.

SOARES: And we did hear from the secretary general when he was in Moscow, where he told us that Putin agreed in principle to allow the U.N., to allow the Red Cross to create these evacuation corridors. I mean, we have been here before, Toby, and Putin has broken those promises.

FRICKER: I mean, everyone from the U.N. is doing what we can to achieve, to get into areas of heavy fighting, to provide both humanitarian supplies, lifesaving supplies, to reach children, to reach women in those areas. But also, the safe passage out.

I mean, I've met children in Zaporizhzhia and other areas who have spoken about being underground for days and weeks, and now over two months. That's terrific for anyone, particularly for children.

SOARES: Talk to us about that, the needs that you and your team -- what you've been seeing on the ground.

FRICKER: Yeah, the needs are massive for children. Any child who is exposed to conflict, their needs are huge, particularly if you are sheltering underground, trying to stay safe. You have mothers, you have women who are trying to protect their children.

SOARES: Yeah.

FRICKER: Doing anything they can to shield their children. And at the same time, going through such stress themselves, and that is incredibly difficult.

[02:10:00]

FRICKER: And then you have children who are leaving their homes. You know, just leaving your home behind is in itself a traumatic experience, being forced to flee to uncertain places.

SOARES: And also, not just every day needs, but also the psychological concerns that you might be seeing right around Ukraine.

FRICKER: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the longer the war goes on, the more traumatic it is for children.

SOARES: Yeah.

FRICKER: They are exposed to more violence, they are displaced, and they are trying to then recover in areas they don't know. That is why it is important that we can provide some support. That can be emotional support. Even just some normality, meaning some areas to play --

SOARES: Yeah.

FRICKER: Some trusted adults to be with them, and getting that psychological support to children as quickly as we possibly can.

SOARES: And we've been talking and we showed in that map there -- I'm not sure if my producer can bring it up. We showed in that map the number of people who have left, the refugees.

But there is also another element of this. If this drags on, as the NATO chief has said in the last few hours, if this drags on, the seven -- we also have to think about the 7.7 million displaced. Talk to us about the challenges of those that stay within the country and the need for those inside the country.

FRICKER: The needs for children, for women inside Ukraine are massive because you have a whole movement of people west primarily --

SOARES: Yeah.

FRICKER: -- where it is relatively safer, and that creates a strain itself on the medical facilities in cities where that have almost doubled in some cases in size.

So, it is about providing supplies, extra sort of buffer of supplies that we can. It is about providing informal educations, support in shelters, for example. So, I've been to shelters in Dnipro where you have -- it's 300 people. And we can provide little games in there. You can get teachers and volunteers to go and support children who are going through some stress in those places.

SOARES: We have heard from our teams on the ground that some of the people, especially coming into -- civilians coming into Zaporizhzhia, I've been hearing of stories of civilians forcibly being taken to Russian-controlled territory. Is this something that you've been hearing about as well?

FRICKER: Those reports are obviously horrific. Anyone should be able to move where they want to go.

SOARES: Yeah.

FRICKER: That's critically important. Children and women should go where they feel safest. That's really key, that they have that, obviously that choice to get out. That is why the humanitarian corridor is so important.

SOARES: Yeah.

FRICKER: Because it provides that safety, that guaranteed safe passage. And what we've seen is in areas where people have clustered together in civilian cars. You see sometimes they have come under attack and children have been injured. I've seen children in intensive care in Zaporizhzhia who were injured when they tried to get out but they couldn't safely. That's why a humanitarian corridor is so important.

SOARES: Toby, I appreciate you taking the time to speak to us. I'm hoping to see you soon. Best of luck. Thank you very much.

Now, the U.S. president says the war has entered a critical window, those were his words, making military aid to Ukraine all, of course, the more essential. And he has now proposed what is by far the largest funding package yet.

Joe Biden is asking the American Congress to approve an additional $33 billion to help Ukraine. Most of that for military -- you can see there --- for military and security systems. The remaining billions will be spent on economic and humanitarian aid. President Biden is calling on Congress to approve the bill as quickly as possible. Have a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The cost of this fight is not cheap, but caving to aggression is going to be more costly if we allow it to happen. We either back the Ukrainian people as they defend their country or we stand by as the Russians continue their atrocities and aggression in Ukraine.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

SOARES: He also outlined a plan to put further pressure on Russian oligarchs by sending profits from their seized assets straight to Ukraine.

My colleague, Michael Holmes, will be back with more news after a short break, including a look at two key European nations working to get the natural gas they need without violating, of course, international sanction. We will have that.

And Amazon may have revolutionized the home delivery game, but it seems it missed delivering the profits. Details of the tech giant's abysmal earnings after this short break. You are watching CNN.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[02:15:00]

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HOLMES: Germany's vice chancellor says his nation must think outside the box when it comes to ending dependence on Russian energy, and embrace ideas that were previously seen as -- quote -- "unrealistic."

Now, his comments come after Russia cut natural gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria over their refusal to pay in rubles. Two major European companies said on Thursday that they are working on a way to make the rubble payments without running afoul of sanctions.

Germany's Uniper and Australia's OMV confirmed they are in talks to find a sanction-compliant solution. Hungary says it will use Moscow's payment scheme.

All right, let's check in on the global markets now. The Shanghai Composite up over 2%. Green arrows all around in Asia. The Nikkei up one and three quarter. The Seoul Kospi up nearly 1%. The Australia S&P ASX up over 1%.

Now, free market investors are reacting to earnings reports from tech giants Apple and Amazon. That is affecting the tech heavy NASDAQ, as you can see there, down nearly half a percentage point. S&P pretty much flattened. The DOW Futures slightly up. Slightly.

A rough quarter for Amazon. That's prying on minds there in the Wall Street. The first time in years, actually, the tech giant reporting a quarterly loss, and it's a big one. The company reporting a nearly $4 billion-loss in the first three months of the year.

Analysts actually expected the $4 billion profit. Amazon blaming a loss in its investment in lithium, an electric automaker, in addition to the pandemic and the Ukraine war.

[02:19:56]

HOLMES: Now, the report came after the closing bell which caused Amazon stop to plummet in after-hours trading, down more than 9%.

Rana Foroohar is a CNN global economic analyst and columnist and associate editor for "The Financial Times." It is good to see you. We've seen the markets' reaction in -- after the bell trading with Amazon. What do we like to see when -- likely to see when the markets open? Just how big of a deal is this?

RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST, COLUMNIST AND ASSOCIATE EDITOR FOR THE FINANCIAL TIMES: Well, it is a big deal. I mean, you know, you think about Amazon as being one of the richest, certainly one of the strongest companies in America, and this is coming off the back of some wobbles that we've already seen with other earnings reports, other tech companies, in particular. So, you know, it's going to have an impact.

I would not be surprised if this led the market lower for some time and it's a correction that frankly a lot of us have been expecting. You know, you've seen the war interrupting all kinds of things, supply chains, creating inflation that has a knock-on effect for companies that makes prices higher, consumers start to feel that.

Anecdotally, I'm hearing and seeing a lot of people saying, anything that is not necessary, I'm not going to spend money on right now --

HOLMES: Right.

FOROOHAR: -- especially on purchases. You know, Netflix streaming, you're seeing those numbers go down. Electronic gadgets, vacations. So, I think you're starting to see a trend here where consumers are worried. They feel the tremors around the world and they're concerned.

HOLMES: I guess it's a combination of things, isn't they? You've got those economic worries, inflation, and so on. But also, Amazon have benefited greatly from the pandemic shutdown as people, you know, they jumped into online buying, not much else to do.

FOROOHAR: Yeah.

HOLMES: So, what then would be the outlook for Amazon in the post- pandemic environment, especially with those, you know, inflation worries, fears of even a recession?

FOROOHAR: I think, in some ways, Amazon is a kind of a very big canary in the coal mine of the global economy. If this company is starting to feel the bite from the war and from inflation and from other troubles, there are some investments that were, you know, perhaps didn't pan out, but if they're starting to feel the pain, then you can bet that other companies will, too.

In the very beginning, a lot of the big tech firms did well because, as you mentioned, everyone went online. You know, the online economy boomed. The big got bigger.

But nobody is immune from a cut in consumer spending, from a supply chain fiasco, and certainly from rising inflation. This is going to bite and we are feeling it. I think that this could be the beginning of some real jitters in the market for the next -- the rest of the year.

HOLMES: Well, that was -- that was my next question. Can you see a correction coming across the whole market?

FOROOHAR: I could. I definitely could. In fact, it's something I've been expecting for some time. You can look back in history and you can draw some parallels with the 70s, even with the 30s, when you saw very similar -- interestingly, very similar geopolitical issues.

A lot of strife, a pandemic leading into a recession, a lot of monetary stimuluses that then prop markets up, you've got rising wages but then you had World War II coming and you saw market crash.

So, you know, we are in the middle of some of these similar dynamics. As I wrote in my past Monday column for "The Financial Times," you know, we could be seeing that kind of a correction at some point.

One question I have is, is that going to derail the U.S. consumer? The U.S. consumer has still in the midst of pandemic, in the midst of war, will play this role as the buyer of last resort. We are starting to see that change a little bit. Are we going to now see that consumer really pull back and say, no, I want to keep more cash on hand? I'm going to really save and savings rate go up in the U.S.? That will be a big shift.

HOLMES: Yeah. And when it comes to Amazon, specifically, I mean, a loss of $3.8 billion. Compared to the same period last year, it made $8.1 billion. The projections were a profit of $4 billion, I think. How could projections to Wall Street have been so wrong? What happens to make it so wrong?

FOROOHAR: Well, you know, there's just a lot in play right now. I've been doing this for 30 years. I can't remember a period when the amount that could change at any given moment in the economy was as much as it is now. It is just incredibly volatile. And, you know, even a company like this is feeling it. Consumer sentiment can turn on a dime. The war is changing in real time. China is still locked down yet again --

HOLMES: Yeah.

FOROOHAR: -- because of the pandemic. So, there is just a lot of flux right now. I think it's really difficult for anyone to predict really on a week-by-week basis what's going to happen.

[02:25:00]

HOLMES: Yeah. Yeah. Always terrific analysis. Great to see you. Rana Foroohar, thank you.

FOROOHAR: Thank you so much.

HOLMES: More to come here on CNN, including the story of a 12-year- old Ukrainian girl held for weeks by Russian forces. How she was freed and what she says about her experience when we come back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[02:30:00] ISA SOARES, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to our viewers in the United States and all around the world. I'm Isa Soares coming to you live from Lviv, Ukraine. And this just coming into CNN, we are getting word that another fuel depot is on fire in a Russian-controlled part of Ukraine. Now, this time it's in the Donetsk region. The head of the separatist administration said the fire was caused by Ukrainian shelling. And this has happened recently at several other Russian- controlled fuel depots. We'll stay on top of that breaking news story and bring it, of course, to you as soon as we have more information.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials are condemning a barrage of Russian strikes on the Capitol. Ukraine's president says five missiles struck in Kyiv, while UN Secretary-General -- Secretary-General was visiting and that this was a Russian attempt to humiliate the United Nations and everything it represents. At least several people in were inside an apartment building hit by one of those strikes were wounded. While in Ukraine, the Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, also visited Bucha, where Russian forces are accused of carrying out war crimes against civilians. Ukrainian authorities say 10 Russian servicemen have now been identified as suspects in the atrocities.

And in Washington, the U.S. President has urged Congress to quickly approve an additional $33 billion in aid for Ukraine. That is the largest funding package yet. The bulk of that will go towards military assistance. Joe Biden also spoke out against the latest nuclear rhetoric by Russia. Have a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No one should be making final comments about the use of nuclear weapons or the possibility to use that. It's irresponsible.

SOARES: Now, millions of Ukrainians have been displaced since the war started but one of them has been reunited with family in Cuba. 12- year-old girl taken into Russian occupied territory after bombs killed her father in Mariupol. CNN's Matt Rivers has a harrowing story.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): For Kira Obedinsky, her new iPad is everything, she's 12 after all. But the shiny screen is also a welcome distraction from an ordeal no 12-year- old should ever have to endure because just a few weeks ago, the young Ukrainian wasn't safe like she is now and Kyiv, but in a hospital run by Russian-backed separatists forcibly separated from her family. When the Russians first invaded Mariupol, Kira's dad, Yevhen, was still alive. Her mom had died just after she was born. And when Russian bombs started to fall, they sheltered in a neighbor's basement she recalls.

KIRA OBEDINSKY, 12-YEAR-OLD TAKEN FROM MARIUPOL: Speaking a foreign language.

RIVERS: But they hit the house where we were staying. She says. We were buried in the cellar. Then the rescuers took us out of the wreckage. Her dad did not emerge. Kira told us. Now an orphan she started to walk to try and find safety amidst the chaos, and then, another explosion from a mine.

OBEDINSKY: Speaking a foreign language.

RIVERS: My friends saw something on the ground, she says, and she hid it accidentally with her boot. The military came after the explosions and took us to a hospital because we were bleeding. But in some ways, her journey was just beginning. In the chaos, she was picked up by soldiers. She says spoke Russian and was eventually brought to a Russian-held area in Donetsk.

OBEDINSKY: Speaking a foreign language.

RIVERS: I was taken there at night. She says. They took shrapnel out of me, out of my ear. I screamed and cried a lot. It was shortly after this happened that CNN first learned about and reported Kira's story because Russia paraded it on state TV.

OBEDINSKY: Speaking a foreign language.

RIVERS: State propagandist showed images of Kira in a Donetsk hospital and said she was being treated well. Convinced she was being mistreated, her family went public with her story and it worked. A deal between Russia and Ukraine allowed her grandfather to travel to Russia and bring her back to Kyiv where she told us with Russian state TV did not.

OBEDINSKY: Speaking a foreign language.

RIVERS: It's a bad hospital there. The food there is bad. The nurses scream at you. The bed is bent like this. There wasn't enough space for all of us inside. None of that came out on Russian state TV. Her injuries have largely healed now though she'll stay in the hospital a little longer. It was there that someone gave her that iPad after a presidential visit came bearing gifts this week. She didn't love all that attention though, so for now she says she just wants to see her cat and spend time with her grandfather recovering from the horrors of war one game at a time. Matt Rivers, CNN. Kyiv, Ukraine.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

[02:35:00]

SOARES: She just wants to be a 12-year-old girl like any other girl, wonderful piece there from Matt Rivers. Well, officials in Ukraine say 45 Ukrainians have been freed in the latest prisoner exchange with Russia, more than two dozen service members and a dozen civilians. It's not known how many Russian prisoners were freed as Russia has yet to confirm the swap.

American, Trevor Reed, is back in the U.S. after being released by Russia in a prisoner swap. He arrived at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas earlier on Thursday mornings, you can see there, almost three years after being detained in Moscow. Reed's parents say he will be taken to a military hospital for monitoring. His mother tweeted it has been a day of joy for his family. She also called for the release of the other Americans detained still, of course, in Russia.

And I'll be back at the top of the hour. But just ahead, we'll have the very latest on China's COVID surge, a live report for you from Beijing. That is next. You were watching CNN.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[02:40:00]

MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR: Well, perhaps some light at the end of the tunnel for many in Shanghai hard hit by COVID. According to City Health Officials, more than 12 billion people in Shanghai live in low- risk areas and can now leave their homes. That's millions more than just nine days ago.

And what you hear there is the banging of pots in Shanghai as people protest from their balconies over the insufficient and inequitable distribution of daily supplies and the month-long lockdown. Officials say almost all of the more than 15,000 new cases across China were reported in Shanghai. For more on that, I'm joined by CNN's Steven Jiang who is live in Beijing for us.

You know, it is remarkable and we've talked about this many times. Given you know Shanghai and Beijing's enormous populations, it takes only one or two or three cases and there's lockdowns.

STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: That's right, Michael. You know, it's not just in Beijing and Shanghai, when we look at this on a nationwide scale by CNN's own calculation, at least 180 million people in this country are now living under some form of lockdown and many people in smarter cities have been living like this for months with very little outside attention and no end in sight.

Now, you mentioned Shanghai. Finally, some residents are able to leave their houses for the first time in weeks. And I have been talking to some residents there. And this time, you know, it seems to be happening for real because authorities have made similar promises before but only to reverse their decision at a very last minute. But now finally, I've seen people you know, went out of their compounds to -- for a jog or going to the convenience store around the corner to get some ice cream for their kids. You know, just such simple things that people use to take for granted had become such luxury.

But here in Beijing, things seem to be taking a turn for the worst. All schools are closed today along with a growing number of major hospitals. So these are really rather ominous signs despite officially, they have only recorded some 200 confirmed cases in this latest outbreak out of the city's 20 plus million residents, and most of -- most of us have already gone through three rounds of mandatory COVID tests this week. As you may be able to see behind me some people are lining up to get their third test this week at this testing location.

But already, we noticed streets are less congested even during rush hours. And one reason for that could be many commuters who live outside of Beijing's jurisdictions are actually being locked out. And then of course, for the most part inside the city, we are still able to move about except for many people living in so-called-high risk areas, that's where you have confirmed cases, authorities have been a sealing them off in their homes and they're also expanding such areas.

As of now, shops are still open and supplies including food and grocery seem to be plentiful both online and in-store. But people have been stocking up because as many of them have been constantly reminded by their friends and family in Shanghai, things could change at any moment in officials' promises and reassurances really don't mean much anymore -- don't mean much anymore after that fiasco in Shanghai, Michael.

HOLMES: Yes, indeed. Not surprisingly. Steven, thank you. Steven Jiang there for us. Now, since the beginning of the pandemic, China has had strict COVID regulations as we've just been discussing. CNN's Selina Wang now shows us just how difficult it is to travel to and within the country.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Traveling into China is like entering a fortress. The country has been virtually sealed off since the start of the pandemic, guarded by strict border controls in the world's harshest quarantine. My journey to get in started with three PCR tests in Tokyo. Seven days out from my flight just got my first COVID test. Back at home, I track my daily temperature and pack a suitcase full of snacks to prepare for 21 days in quarantine.

Within 48 hours of boarding, China requires PCR tests at two different government-approved clinics. This is possibly the most paperwork I've ever needed to board an airplane. I say goodbye to Tokyo, my home, for the past one and a half years, checking in at the airport, relatively smooth. Still, she's checking my documents. I finally have my boarding pass. I'm at the gate. I'm going to check.

Most people on my flight or Chinese citizens. Foreigners can only enter under very limited conditions. It's even harder for American journalists because of U.S.-China tensions. All the flight attendants are in full protective gear. Getting ready for takeoff, there we go. Flights into China, especially Beijing are extremely limited.

[02:45:00]

WANG: Even though I'll be based in the capital first I'm flying to Yunnan Province. After landing, I got another COVID test. A bus eventually takes us to the quarantine location. No one can choose where there'll be locked in for the next 21 days. Hours later, we arrived. I count myself lucky. It's a hot spring resort converted into a quarantine site. It's my first time here, but I'll have to enjoy the view from the window.

I can't step out onto the balcony or open my door except for health checkups and food pickup. Two temperature checks a day, regular COVID tests sometimes even twice a day. Food delivery isn't allowed but breakfast, lunch, and dinner are part of the quarantine fees. These restrictions are all part of China's zero-COVID policy.

Across China, tens of millions are sealed inside their homes. Since mid-December, China's average new daily case count has surged from double digits to more than 20,000. Any positive case and close contact have to go to a government quarantine. The entire metropolis is brought to a standstill. Most of Shanghai's 25 million residents have been locked in for weeks, many struggling to get enough food and medical care. In year three of the pandemic, most of the world is learning to live with COVID but in China, no case is tolerated. No matter the emotional and economic cost. Selena Wang, CNN. Kunming, China.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

HOLMES: Moderna is seeking an Emergency Use Authorization from U.S. drug regulators. Now, this would be for its COVID vaccine for young kids. Moderna's data shows its vaccines have 51 percent effective at preventing symptoms in children ages six months to under a year, and 37 percent effective in ages two through five. Earlier, CNN spoke to Moderna's chief medical officer about the clinical trials.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DR. PAUL BURTON, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, MODERNA: These are exciting results, I think, and an important day for us. When we looked at these children and we had 7000 of them in this study, first of all, we looked at safety, you know, as a dad, as a physician, that's obviously what we always want to look at first, particularly in this you know, very young group.

The safety was very reassuring exactly what we've seen in older kids and other populations. Some injection site, pain a little bit of fever, but no excess risk of high fever, so that was very reassuring. When we look at antibody levels, we wanted to see levels that were similar to what we found in young adults, so as 18 to 24. And it's -- that's exactly what we found. So overall, I think this is a very reassuring result and good news.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HOLMES: Dr. Anthony Fauci says the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is weighing whether to consider granting Emergency Use Authorization vaccines for young children for both Moderna and Pfizer, at the same time. Well, a blow to the tobacco industry that health officials say could save thousands of lives in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed a new rule to ban menthol from cigarettes and flavored cigars in the U.S. Studies show people who smoke menthol cigarettes have a harder time quitting compared to dropping regular cigarettes. Tobacco companies have aggressively marketed mental products to young people.

The weather, contributing to a critical fire danger in parts of the U.S. We'll go to the CNN weather center for the latest when we come back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [02:50:00]

HOLMES: More than 5 million people are under red flag warnings in the southwestern United States. Stronger winds, lower humidity, and dry terrain could lead to new or existing fires to spread uncontrollably this weekend. Officials say more than a million acres have been scorched in the region since January. CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam joins me now to tell us more about all of this. Hey, Derek.

DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, Michael, you just said it over a million acres have burned so far year to date. That's incredible. So let's try and put this into perspective because on an average season, up to this particular date, April 29, we've only experienced over 630,000 acres of charred landscape and we've already eclipsed that with over a million being burned. This is just one of the several large active wildfires. This is coming out of the U.S. state of Nebraska. We have eight separate states with 14 active large wildfires, so that really puts it into perspective as well. So much of it is focused on the Great Basin or the Four Corners region.

Here's Arizona and New Mexico. Let's just give you two examples of the ongoing fires here. We've been monitoring these for the past week or so and I've seen some improvement in terms of containment for the tunnel of fire, that's good. Calf Canyon, just outside of Santa Fe, that fire's at 33 percent contained. But you can also notice the number of acreages that have been burned.

Of course, it is so concerning with our fire weather concerns for the day today. Extreme fire weather conditions exist across Southeast Colorado into portions of New Mexico as well as Nebraska that's why the National Weather Service has hoisted our red flag warnings for so many millions of Americans. And there is the increase in our wildfire threat today as the winds pick up and we continue with the extremely dry conditions across the Plains and the Great Basin, Michael, a very active day ahead.

HOLMES: Yes, indeed. Thanks for the update, Derek. Good to see you, my friend. Derek Van Dam there. And some incredible pictures from the U.S. space agency of wreckage found on Mars and no, it's not from an alien spaceship but NASA's Mars helicopter ingenuity did locate and photograph the parachute that helped its rover perseverance land on the red planet as well as the shell that protected rover's landing capsule.

[02:55:00]

HOLMES: In all, the chopper snapped 10 aerial photographs on its 26th flight last week. Of course, landing a rover on Mars is no small feat. It survived extreme gravitational forces and high temperatures as it screamed into the Martian atmosphere at 20,000 kilometers an hour before its safe landing 14 months ago. Yes, and is still taking photographs. Thanks for spending part of your day with me. I'm Michael Holmes live from Ukraine. After a break, I'll see you tomorrow.

Austria participates "constructively" in EU debate on Russian oil ban

Vienna/Brussels - Austria participates "constructively" in the EU states' debate on a stop to Russian oil imports, EU circles claimed on Monday. The German broadcaster ZDF reported that Austria withdrew its veto against the embargo. This was put into perspective by a person involved in the subject: "There was no veto. The consultations with the EU states for the sixth sanction package are ongoing, nothing has been decided yet." Meanwhile Hungary threatened a veto.

Due to the Russian invasion in Ukraine more than two months ago EU states decided on an import ban for Russian coal. Several EU countries have demanded an extension for Russian oil and gas as well. Many countries however are dependent on Russian energy imports.

Currently Austria barely imports Russian oil. "Our major dependency is in the gas sector, namely up to 80 percent", Minister for Europe Karoline Edtstadler (Conservative People's Party, VP) said. Germany for example imports more than one third of its oil imports from Russia.

Edtstadler urged consideration for other EU states in the discussion on a Russian oil embargo. Austria waits for the proposal of the EU commission which then will be reviewed.

Besides Austria and Hungary also Slovakia, Spain, Italy and Greece are considered to be the brakes on a boycott. On Monday the EU Energy Ministers discuss Russia's gas supply freeze.

According to the German news agency dpa, Hungarian Chancellery Minister Gergely Gulyas said on TV Sunday evening: "Let us be clear: we will never support sanctions (with regard to oil and gas supplies)."

In the EU the approval of all members is necessary for such sanctions.

It makes no sense if the EU commission proposes sanctions which need to be resolved unanimously, when these sanctions would limit Hungarian imports, Gulyas said. Currently nobody could substitute Russian oil and gas supply.

For a transition five years "vast amounts of money" were needed. The EU commission however holds back EU aid for Hungary. Gulyas referred to financial support of the new European Recovery Fund which is held back due concerns of unlawful use.

Hungary stands alone in its no to the Russian oil veto to which Germany and Austria accede

The European Union is trying to resolve the latest reluctance within its ranks to sanction Russian oil in retaliation for the cuts in gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, after these two countries refused to pay for their purchases in rubles. At an extraordinary meeting of energy ministers, the hitherto reluctant governments of Germany and Austria expressed their readiness to adopt a new sanctions package that includes crude from Moscow, leaving Hungary as the only country still refusing. "Austria is ready to support an oil embargo consistently if the Commission and the member states so decide. We are ready, I can say that," said Austrian Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler.

In the same vein, the German Robert Habeck stressed that, "after two months of work", his country "is not against a ban on Russian oil" and, although he acknowledged that "there is no time" to prevent such a sanction from causing a "local" problem in a refinery that uses exclusively Russian crude oil, he emphasized that "it will not hit the economy as a whole". Habeck did point out the need for the sanction on Moscow's oil to be gradual in order to undertake "technical preparations", while warning that "other countries may have more serious problems" if such a measure were to be adopted.

The move by Berlin and Vienna leaves Budapest as the only capital of the club that still openly maintains its veto on European sanctions - which must be approved unanimously - to include oil and gas from Russia, according to Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's spokesman on the social network Twitter.

And this despite the fact that the Polish government, its main partner in the bloc, on Monday demanded greater forcefulness against Moscow in response to the cuts in gas supplies to his country and Bulgaria. "We already have coal, now it's time for oil and the next step is gas. The best option is for them to go together," emphasized Polish Climate and Environment Minister Anna Moskwa.

The European Commission has not yet wanted to detail the content of what will be the sixth package of sanctions against the Kremlin, which will also include sanctions against more Russian and Belarusian banks, new individual sanctions or the application of corrective measures also to the Russian nuclear sector. Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson summoned the press to the meeting of the college of commissioners scheduled for Tuesday.

According to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), the European Union has bought more than 47.4 billion euros in energy products from Russia since the invasion of Ukraine (19.7 billion in oil, 27 billion in gas and 780 million in coal).

Gas cut-off While the possible veto on Russian oil dominates the energy debate in Brussels, the energy ministers of the EU-27 met to discuss gas, following Gazprom's unilateral cuts. The European Commission, Warsaw and Sofia assure that "there is no immediate risk" either for Polish and Bulgarian companies or consumers and, in the medium term, Poland will be able to receive gas from Lithuania and Bulgaria from Greece.

But Gazprom's decision "is a turning point in the current crisis", according to the Commissioner, who does not rule out that Moscow could order a gas cut-off to the whole EU in the cold half of the year.

The subway reserves of the Member States, which the Commission wants to reach 80% before next autumn, are currently at 32% "and growing". But Brussels - and Moscow - knows that stockpiles and diversification will not be enough. "We cannot replace 165 billion cubic meters of gas with other suppliers," acknowledged Simson, who indicated that we will have to rely on renewables and hydrogen and recalled that at the end of May the Commission will present the details of its plan to accelerate the disconnection of Russian energy.

Also by the end of May, the Kremlin wants European importers to submit to Russia's new payment system, which requires buyers to open a euro and a ruble account at Gazprombank. Brussels insists that European companies cannot agree to pay in rubles because such a move would implicate Russia's Central Bank, prop up its currency and amount to "a violation of sanctions" on Moscow.

But companies are demanding more clarity and Brussels, which says it has no information that any European company has agreed to such payments, has pledged to issue "in the coming days" new guidance so that importers know how they can legally buy energy from Vladimir Putin's Russia.

The European Union (EU) is trying to resolve the latest reluctance within the EU to sanction Russian oil in retaliation for the cuts in gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, after these two countries refused to pay for their purchases in rubles.

At an extraordinary meeting of energy ministers, the governments of Germany and Austria, so far reluctant, expressed their readiness to adopt a new sanctions package that includes crude oil from Moscow, leaving Hungary as the only country that still rejects it, EFE news agency reported.

"Austria is ready to support an oil embargo consistently if the Commission and the member states so decide. We are ready, I can say that," said Austrian Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler.

Russia: EU reportedly to approve ban on Russian oil this week

Oil embargo should not have immediate effect

Germany, Austria, Slovakia and Hungary drop opposition to embargo

Bloc to adopt additional sanctions on Sberbank

The EU will approve a ban on Russian oil this week and more sanctions on Russia's biggest lender Sberbank, The New York Times and The Times reported. EU ambassadors should finalise the proposal on Wednesday. This should accelerate the approval process, which this time should go without a new meeting of EU leaders. The prohibition would be the biggest sanction against Moscow implemented so far, officials commented before The Times. EU countries would reportedly rely on imports from the Gulf Countries, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Nigeria to deal with the embargo.

A senior EU diplomat told ZDF TV channel that Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, Spain, Italy and Greece previously blocked an oil embargo. However, Germany's decision[https://emergingmarketwatch.com/browser#/article/1160353] to drop opposition was a decisive factor. Hungary, Austria and Slovakia followed its lead and are no longer against such a measure. Austrian energy minister Leonore Gewessler confirmed that Vienna is ready to back such a step. German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock stated that the oil ban could be maintained for years if needed. However, she spoke about Berlin's backing for gradual prohibtion. Meanwhile, German EconMin Rober Habeck said that Berlin should be fully independent from Russian oil by the end of the summer. Thus, it seems certain that the oil embargo will not have an immediate effect.

EU Commission submitted oil embargo draft

Brussels - The EU Commission has presented the draft for a new sanction package against Russia, which primarily provides for an oil embargo. According to diplomats the commission submitted the draft to all EU members the night of Wednesday. The paper provides for a gradual import ban within six to eight months. Exceptions were made for Hungary and Slovakia. This was according to the news agency AFP.

The EU plans a "complete ban on imports of all Russian oil", Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday in Strasbourg.

The oil embargo is the main component of the sixth EU sanction package against Russia. On Wednesday representatives of the EU states will discuss the sanctions. For adoption a unanimous decision of the 27 EU members is required.

Hungary and Slovakia are heavily dependent on Russian oil. They should be allowed to continue imports until the end of 2023.

The two countries obtain Russian oil via the southern line of the Druzhba pipeline, which also provides the Czech Republic. Hungary imports around 65 percent of its oil from Russia, stated the government in Budapest. This was more than double the EU average of recently 26 percent.

Hungary had threatened to veto the oil embargo, if it limited the own supply security.

According to EU diplomats the commission draft could start a new quarrel. The Czech Republic and Bulgaria also push for exceptions, citing their economies that are heavily dependent on Russian oil.

Vienna - Austria fully supports the sixth EU sanctions package against Russia. This stated Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg (Conservative People's Party, VP) on Wednesday. "We want sanctions that hit Russia and not sanctions that weaken us more than they weaken Russia", he said. The sanctions package includes an oil embargo against Russia. It will be negotiated in Brussels as of Wednesday.

The war in Ukraine is a "breach of civilisation of unimagined extent" and a "turning point in our history", the Foreign Minister said. But the EU is meeting this challenge.

The oil embargo will affect the member states differently, as not all of them are equally dependent on Russian oil, Schallenberg said. Despite the exceptions for Hungary and Slovakia in the sanction package, Schallenberg was confident an agreement will be found.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, and welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world, I'm Rosemary Church in Atlanta.

Ahead this hour, the Federal Reserve gave interest rates their biggest hike in more than two decades. But will the move help tab down soaring inflation.

ISA SOARES, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Isa Soares live in Ukraine. With more than five million Ukrainians fleeing this war-torn country the need for aid and assistance is becoming more and more dire, the challenges facing aid organizations ahead with my guest.

Welcome to the show, everyone. It's 10 a.m. here in Ukraine. And we are awaiting word on whether anymore civilians have made it out of the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. Humanitarian corridors promised by Russia are supposed to be open to allow evacuations. We don't know yet if Moscow is honoring that pledge. We have yet to hear from the Ukrainian officials on this.

And Mariupol officials say that shelling though remains nonstop. And this is what the complex has endured over the past few days, just relentless as well as growing attacks from Russian forces. Civilians are trapped there, along with the city's last Ukrainian defenders. And here is how Ukrainian commander inside the plant describes the situation.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DENYS PROKOPENKO, COMMANDER, AZOV REGIMENT (through translator): For two days, now the enemy has broken into the territory of the plant. These are heavy, bloody battles. I am proud of my soldiers who are making superhuman efforts to contain the enemy's onslaught.

(END VIDEO CLIP) SOARES: We are being told those are from Mariupol made about 30 children worth reminding everyone, still inside that large complex. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says 344 people were evacuated from Mariupol and other nearby areas on Wednesday. We don't know if any of them, of course, were rescued from that steel plant.

Meanwhile, progress is being reported on the ground and a counter offensive in the Kharkiv region, where forces have taken back more territory. Ukraine has now retaken the village of Moldova, which is just 25 kilometers, or about 13 miles from the Russian border and should not be confused with Molodova the country, the latest village to come back under Ukrainian control in the last two weeks.

Meantime, Ukraine says that Russian forces have made few advances in Luhansk and Donetsk regions despite of course what we have seen, the heavy bombardments. In fact, just a short time ago, the Ukrainian military said Russians have had, quote, "no success with efforts to break through the front lines in those regions over the past 24 hours."

In the Luhansk region, new drone footage shows stunning devastation in the town of Popasna. The drone appears to have been used by the Russian military as they track Ukrainian troops amid intense street fighting.

Well, CNN correspondents are across the region covering the conflict from every angle. Our Sara Sidner in Kyiv, Nic Robertson in Vienna, Austria, and Melissa Bell in Paris. First though to Sara Sidner with more on how fight for control of the Azovstal steel plant is unfolding.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): Our brave boys are defending this fortress, but it's really hard.

SARA SIDNER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: A grueling, bloody battle as Russian forces try to extinguish the last pocket of Ukrainian fighters hold up in Mariupol's sprawling steel plant. Video from Russian separatists shows tanks moving in, a barrage of explosions from the air.

According to a senior U.S. defense official, a couple thousand Russian forces are still in the devastated city. Russia's defense minister claims Putin's forces have reliably blocked the Ukrainian fighters, cornered in the plant.

The Ukrainian foreign minister says that the plan still hold despite the relentless Russian attacks. Outfront spoke to one of the Ukrainian commanders inside the plant on Monday. At the, time he spoke about their fight.

SVYATOSLAV PALAMAR, STATIONED INSIDE MARIUPOL PLANT (through translator): We will be fighting, as long as it is needed, despite extremely difficult conditions.

[03:05:02]

SIDNER: According to the mayor of Mariupol, there are still hundreds of civilians inside that plant, including 30 children.

And tonight, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a private phone call, was urging the U.N. secretary general to help save the lives of the people who remain in danger. And for those who have managed to escape, you can see it in their faces just how difficult it has been, little food, no water, none of life's essentials, a far cry from the way that things used to be.

TATYANA, EVACUEE FROM MARIUPOL (through translator): This one girl said you can start your life on a new page, but I do not want to. My previous pages were so clean, I want to go back to my pages and I know that it's impossible.

SIDNER: And while the grinding assault continues, a different story is being told in Russia, a state TV host returning to the air after visiting Mariupol. The man known to many as the voice of Putin, claims those remaining in Mariupol don't want Russia to leave, propaganda, plain and simple.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

SOARES: That was Sara Sidner reporting there. We got an update actually in the last few minutes from Mariupol. An official from Mariupol telling CNN that the attacks inside Azovstal that Sara is reporting there, that is continuing -- that's continuing overnight. Nonstop shelling is what they are telling us.

As of now, this is with the advisor said, if there is hell in the world, it is in Azovstal. She paints really a picture of what is happening. Of course, we'll stay on top of the story.

Now the number of Ukrainians being reported fleeing the fighting is rising by the day. The U.N. says more than 5.6 million people have left Ukraine since the war began. Almost eight million others of course are internally displaced, within the country. Many of them in dire need, as you can see there.

That's where my next guest comes in. John Shmorhun is project director for Move Ukraine, a group working to build homes for the internally displaced. He is here with me in Lviv. John, great to have you on the show, thank you very much for coming in.

JOHN SHMORHUN, DIRECTOR, HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, UKRAINIAN EDUCATION PLATFORM: Thanks for having me.

SOARES: Let's talk about really what you and your team from the ground, the stories that you've been hearing and the need -- where the need that might -- give us an idea where the needs need to go.

SHMORHUN: Well, first of all, the biggest need is for food. What we're seeing is from our donors that there is a market decrease in the amount of food supplies that we are getting.

SOARES: Why is that?

SHMORHUN: Because of the cost of food, the logistics still there but the cost of food is going through the roof, and therefore, a lot of donors are finding themselves looking for other suppliers, for example, going through Turkey, the Canadian Ukrainian Foundation that has been supplying us with food packets, have been going through Turkey now two supplies with those food boxes for the IDP's.

SOARES: What I heard, I mean, sorry, my phone just alerted me that there is a siren going off here in Lviv. Warning us of course there could be missiles going over the area. This is something we've seen more of in the last 24 hours, I think yesterday I think we saw two or three.

SHMORHUN: Yes.

SOARES: So, it's definitely more becoming more frequent, this is obviously the first alert. I get it first on my phone and then we are told obviously, this is an alert for people to go into bunkers. So, we'll stay on top of this and monitor the situation of course.

But what I was saying, was that, you know, yesterday the mayor of Lviv, the deputy mayor of Lviv was on the show and he was saying to me, look, what we've seen yesterday targeting, Russia is targeting supply lines, infrastructure. But he was more worried about grain and the impact that's going to have on food and the delivery of food. What do you -- what do you say to that?

SHMORHUN: Well, certainly, we know that the Russians have been removing about 400,000 tons of grains from Ukraine to Russia. Russia is targeting grain elevators in Ukraine. Russia is obviously mining agricultural fields. All of this, this combination will result in increases in prices in grains, particularly in wheat.

SOARES: And I mean, and that using food as a method of course of, you know, of war it's incredibly important here and something that you have talked about.

SHMORHUN: Yes. It reminds many of Ukrainians of the '32 to '33 famine in Ukraine called the Holodomor. People know that. And this is why for many, many decades people planted their own gardens to ensure that they have enough food to eat. Yes.

[03:09:54]

SOARES: In terms of what you are doing on the ground and the stories that you are hearing, give me a sense of what people are telling you, because of course many have left as we outlined there in that graphic. But it's seven million plus people displaced. It's a huge challenge right now in this country.

SHMORHUN: Well, this is moveukraine.org, we realize that seven million people need homes and this is what we are doing today, we are rebuilding student dormitories, we are building modular homes for the IDP's, so that they have a place to stay and we are trying to integrate them into the communities of western Ukraine. Very important. We want to have happy people. We do not want to have ghettos. So, it's important that we create communities and that's what moveukraine.org does.

SOARES: And this of course is not just about, you know, seeing more people, 7.7., but we're seeing many people coming back. There is an influx of people coming back from other countries, from Poland and et cetera, those were left in the early stages of the war.

SHMORHUN: Mothers and children that have left --

SOARES: Yes.

SHMORHUN: -- want to come back to their loved ones and they also need places to stay. Some of them go back to Kyiv, but a lot of them have no place to go to and so they need houses and this is the plea. The plea is for donations, for building and rebuilding houses in safe areas of Ukraine.

SOARES: John Shmorhun, great to have you on the show. Thank you very much.

SHMORHUN: You, too.

SOARES: Thank you. And if you would like to safely as well as securely of course, help people who may be in need of food, shelter, water, please go to cnn.com/impact, and there you will be able to find several ways that you can help.

Of course, as you were hearing, right now, Rosie, sirens are going off here in Lviv, we are seeing them more frequently. I can tell you that in the last 24 hours, we have seen several sirens go off. As we head of course into the May 9th Victory Day that is so crucial for Putin. People -- a lot of people really keeping a close eye on the movements in this country. And as soon as there is any more development, of course we shall keep you posted, Rosie.

CHURCH: Absolutely. Isa, do take care there, you and your team. We'll get back to you soon.

And just ahead here on CNN Newsroom, the U.S. Federal Reserve is taking action to bring down inflation, but how are the markets reacting? Kristie?

KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Rosemary, Asian markets are trending higher, but analysts say that there is pain in the pipeline. In fact, I spoke to the global strategist at Rabobank, he says the Fed is behind the curve and that inflation will get worse. Much more after the break.

[03:15:00]

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV): Inflation in our financial House is the most important thing we can do for this economy.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CHURCH: Well, the U.S. Federal Reserve seems to be paying attention. It has issued its biggest interest rate hike in 22 years in an effort to bring down inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced the half a percentage point increase on Wednesday with more rate hikes likely. Powell warned that the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China are weighing down economic activity, and it could take a while for prices to come down.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD: I'd like to take this opportunity to speak directly to the American people. Inflation is much too high. And we understand the hardship it is causing. And we're moving expeditiously to bring it back down. We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CHURCH: The Feds decision sent U.S. financial market soaring. Wall Street had its best day in two years. Blue Chip stocks gained more than 900 points, the S&P 500 was up 3 percent, and the NASDAQ rose 3.2 percent. And we are seeing positive results in the Asia-Pacific markets as well. You see the Hang Seng is pretty stable, they're pretty level. The Shanghai Composite up 0.68 percent, and Australia's S&P up nearly 1 percent there.

So, for more on this we go to CNN's Kristie Lu Stout who joins us live from Hong Kong. Kristie, U.S. financial markets reacted positively to the rate hike. And it looks like a similar story across Asia, what are you seeing in those numbers and, what are the experts saying?

LU STOUT: Yes, it's really interesting, Rosemary, because Asian markets are trending higher after the U.S. Federal Reserve, as expected, hiked interest rates by half a percentage point, it's the biggest rate increase since the year 2000. The Fed also signaled further ahead, all in a bid to rain inflation, which is at its highest level since the 1980s.

Now, overnight in the United States, U.S. shares rallied on those comments made by the U.S. Fed chief. He said that the committee is not actively considering an even bigger rate hike, but when you talk to analysts, they say there will be more pain in the pipeline. They say they are concerned that the pace of tightening will pull the U.S. economy into a recession if we bring up those numbers once again.

We have a picture here in Asia of how the markets are trending upwards, I should add that markets in South Korea and Japan are closed. But as you saw earlier, the ASX, there you have it, Shanghai Composite, here in Hong Kong the Hang Seng index marginally higher but all green arrows there.

From Asia, we've also been monitoring U.S. futures, and if we bring up that out graphic for you, you'll get an idea of how U.S. markets will open when they open, or how they'll perform when they open just hours from now.

[03:19:56]

So, you can see NASDAQ futures down four tenths of 1 percent, S&P down a 0.4 percent. The Dow down just over a tenth of 1 percent. Look, inflation in the United States is at its highest level in 40 years, and American consumers are feeling it.

They're feeling it in the price at the gas pump, in the price of groceries, in the price of home prices as well. What's interesting to note is that retail sales remain strong and economists say the reason for that is because of revenge spending. After more than two years of the pandemic, consumers are still buying stuff.

That being said, when you talk to strategists and when talk to analysts, they say there's more pain ahead, and that there is real reasons to be worried. Listen to this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MICHAEL EVERY, GLOBAL STRATEGIST, RABOBANK: I think the market is getting very, very badly wrong about but the Fed said. The fact that the Fed didn't do 75 when the market was maybe thinking about it shows once again the Fed is behind the curve. We have supply side inflation, which is going to get worse because of what the Fed just did.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

LU STOUT: And the global economy faces two additional challenges, the ever fluid war in Ukraine, as well as China's strict zero COVID policy which is weighing on consumer spending in China, as well as the global supply chain. Rosemary?

CHURCH: Very sobering there. Kristie Lu Stout bringing us the latest from Hong Kong, many thanks.

And still to come, the U.K. is slapping new sanctions on Russian media companies, more on the entities that will be impacted by this ban. That's next.

[03:25:00]

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

SOARES: Hello, and welcome back to our viewers all around the world. I'm Isa Soares coming to you live from Lviv, Ukraine.

An American courtroom or a battlefield in Ukraine, a Ukrainian oligarch who is fighting extradition to the U.S. says he'd rather choose option two, it seems. He's asking the U.S. to throw the charges against him so he can fight for his country instead.

CNN's Nic Robertson has the story for you.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: One of Ukraine's richest oligarchs is giving me a ride.

DMYTRO FIRTASH, UKRAINIAN BUSINESSMAN: Please sit.

ROBERTSON: To his war room in his bulletproof Limo.

I think this is the most luxurious armored vehicle I've been in. Do you feel safe in here?

FIRTASH: Yes.

ROBERTSON: Dmytro Firtash has good reason to want protection, he is helping fund Ukraine's fight back against Putin, support the Ukrainians are very happy to have. Inside, Firtash's blast proof office, security guards are just out of sight.

Can you show me on the map where your businesses are?

Before the war, he tells me he employed over 100,000 people in banking, chemicals, media. Some of the early deals came from here as well, Kazakhstan?

FIRTASH: Yes, Kazakhstan.

ROBERTSON: And controlled almost three quarters of Ukraine's fuel imports. He made his fortune buying cheap gas from former Soviet states, which flow to Ukraine through Putin's Russia.

And this is where all your coordination of the war effort is happening here?

FIRTASH: Yes.

ROBERTSON: In his war room, it seems clear his vast wealth is being unleashed against Putin's war. His new TV channel, Freedom, is streaming on the war room wall.

Those are the new tanks.

FIRTASH: Yes.

ROBERTSON: A joint venture with other Ukrainian media bosses. A Russian language channel to counter the Kremlin's anti-western propaganda. From here, Firtash is repurposing his business empire, pitting it against Putin.

FIRTASH (through translator): Our plants that used to produce gas equipment before, today have been transformed to produce anti-tank barriers.

ROBERTSON: He says that his gas line repairman was some of the first back into Bucha, seen of so many alleged Russian war crimes.

FIRTASH (through translator): We provided our vehicles straightaway, and all logistical means to deliver humanitarian aid to all over Ukraine.

ROBERTSON: Are you hoping the government move weapons around the country?

FIRTASH (through translator): We transport whatever they get us.

ROBERTSON: But Putin's war isn't Firtash's only fight right now. He's facing extradition to the U.S. on international racketeering and conspiracy charges involving bribery, an eight-year battle that could be decided soon.

FIRTASH (through translator): They don't even allege that I had bribed somebody, but only intended to organize this.

ROBERTSON: But are they right?

FIRTASH (through translator): A 100 percent no. There was no reason for that, because for me to bribe someone, I need to profit from this. I never benefited from this.

ROBERTSON: The charges are convoluted, allegations of bribes for Indian officials to sell him cut price titanium for U.S. aircraft company. Firtash believes his problems with the United States are geopolitical, and began more than a decade ago, when he was backing Ukrainian politicians perceived as pro-Putin. Now, both his fights are fusing into a perfect storm, he's been stuck in Austria, since his arrest on the U.S. charges in 2014.

FIRTASH (through translator): I am pretty sure that the whole affair was incorrectly assessed by the U.S. government.

[03:30:00]

For some reason, they have concluded that I am pro-Russian, and this doesn't match reality. I've always been pro- Ukrainian. I was trying to make a deal with the prosecutor's office so that they let me go home for the period when the war is going on to defend my country.

ROBERTSON: And they said no.

FIRTASH (through translator): And they said no. So, I am forced to spend some of my time defending myself.

ROBERTSON: Reality is, Firtash knows his eight years fighting extradition here in Vienna could soon be coming to an end. He could be in a U.S. court in just a matter of months.

Are you using the war to launder your image?

FIRTASH (through translator): No, not exactly. What I'm seeing now is a situation where everyone needs to come to the aid of Ukraine. I'll say it for the 20th time. I am a businessman. This is my job. I find ways to make money.

ROBERTSON: Hero, villain, businessman, however history judges Dmytro Firtash, one thing does seem to be clear. His country, Ukraine needs him and his wealth right now. Whether they get it, that depends on American justice.

Nic Robertson, CNN, Vienna, Austria.

SOARES: Fascinating piece there from our Nic Robertson. We'll have much more news after a very short break. You are watching CNN.

[03:35:00]

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

SOARES: Welcome back, everyone. Now the Kremlin is calling sanctions a double-edged weapon after the European Union proposed a six-sanction package on Russia for its war in Ukraine. It happened about 24 hours or so ago on the show.

What Kremlin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov says the west will, quote, "pay a heavy price in trying to harm Moscow."

Meantime, the European Union may find it tricky to implement its proposal to ban Russian oil imports. The Czech Republic and Bulgaria seeking exemption from the ban, while Slovakia and Hungary say they need at least a three-year transition period. Here is more from Hungary's prime minister.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PETER SZIJJARTO, HUNGARIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): It is not a matter of lack of political will or a question about intention or time. This is simply a physical geographical and infrastructural reality.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

SOARES: Well, meantime, the U.K. is announcing new sanctions on Russian media companies. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says it's to prevent Putin's vicious disinformation campaign.

Let's get more on all of this. CNN's Melissa Bell joins us now live from Paris. Good morning, Melissa. I mean, we knew Hungary's position, haven't we, all along, they need about what, 60 percent of its imported oil which comes from Russia. Give us a sense where this leaves the bloc and this proposed ban. Will it scupper it?

MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it isn't just, Isa, that this is the sixth and harshest set of sanctions against Russia that the European Union is proposing, but of course it is also the one that tests European resolve and unity most of all. Any other country in the world that decided to punish itself, and you're quite right, to point those comments from Dmitry Peskov, everyone in Europe is acutely aware that the cost of further sanctions and specifically those against energy are going to cost a great deal to European citizens and unevenly so as they are to Russia. There will be a cost on both sides.

So, it's important to remember that. Europe has been all too aware of that. Even a country that wanted to take the hit in order to inflict it on Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine would find it hard to possibly sell to its electorate.

The problem for the European Union, it is 27 countries having to decide unanimously on sanctions that will affect them unequally. And that really goes to the heart of this particular challenge for the European Union.

So, it is Hungary. It is Slovakia, it is Finland, Bulgaria. These are all countries that rely almost exclusively, or for the great majority of their oil imports on Russian oil. And the question is, beyond whether or not Hungary, unlike other European countries is more reluctant perhaps to go down hard on his great ally Vladimir Putin, it's also that just in terms of getting the logistics of their energy supply, their energy mixed up and running, it's extremely complicated.

You're not just talking about the oil itself, Isa. You're talking about the infrastructure, the companies that are based on that way of organizing their oil supply. It's hugely problematic. And yet the French energy minister just said right now on French radio that she believes that the E.U. will decide unanimously by the end of the week to push ahead with these sanctions. Still, though, a remarkable test of their resolve.

SOARES: Indeed. Indeed. And we shall see what happens in the days ahead. Melissa Bell for us in Paris there, thanks very much, Melissa. Good to see you.

Pope Francis is warning the head of the Russian Orthodox Church not to become, quote, "Putin's altar boy." Those comments in a newspaper interview with Corriere della Sera, the pope's strongest words yet against Patriarch Kirill who has endorsed the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. The pope has denounced the conflict as unjustified and brutal. He said (Inaudible).

He said President Putin may have felt the alliance was barking at Russia's door.

[03:39:58]

Meanwhile, two sources tell CNN the European Union is planning to include Patriarch Kirill in its new round of sanction.

And that does that it for me. Thanks very much for joining. I'm Isa Soares live in Ukraine. For our international viewers Inside Africa is next. For our viewers in the U.S., my colleague Rosemary Church will be right back with more news.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[03:45:00]

CHURCH: U.S. President Joe Biden is sharpening his rhetoric against the Republicans ahead of the high stakes midterm elections when control of Congress will be at stake. On Wednesday, he went after what he called the ultra MAGA agenda of those who still support Donald Trump's make America great again movement. He said MAGA Republicans are protecting billionaires at the expense of working-class Americans, and took aim at Republican Senator Rick Scott's economic plan. Take a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Let me tell you about this ultra MAGA agenda. It's extreme, as most MAGA things are. It will actually raise taxes on 75 million American families over 95 percent of whom make less than $100,000 a year.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CHURCH: Mr. Biden claims his administration will reduce the deficit by a record amount as opposed to Trump's administration, which increased the deficit every year he was in office.

Well, across the U.S., anger is building over the likely loss of federal abortion rights. New demonstrations were held around the country on Wednesday. Supporters of a woman's right to choose are furious that the Supreme Court appears to be on the verge of striking down Roe versus Wade, the landmark law giving women the constitutional right to end their pregnancies.

Meanwhile, we are getting a grim warning from the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She says more people may die without access to safe and legal abortions.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ROCHELLE WALENSKY, DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL: Those who have resources will easily cross state lines and be able to do so. And those that don't may take matters into their own hands and may not get exactly the care that they need in order to do so, and I do think that lives could be at stake in that situation.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CHURCH: Health clinics that perform abortions in the U.S. are often subjected to protests and harassment and sometimes even violence.

CNN's Gary Tuchman visits a clinic in Knoxville, Tennessee to see how people there are coping in the wake of this Supreme Court bombshell.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

GARY TUCHMAN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: These two men are anti- abortion protesters, trying to convince the frightened woman behind the wheel not to drive into this women's medical clinic parking lot where she has an appointment for an abortion. The woman who walked up to the car is the co-director of the clinic, assuring the patient, who speaks little English, is safe with her. And that they will protect her while she is here. This type of confrontation at the Knoxville Center for Reproductive Health in Tennessee is very common, but it's happening at a very unusual moment in time, with the knowledge that legal abortion may be ending very soon in this state.

CORRINE ROVETTI, CO-DIRECTOR, KNOXVILLE CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH: I can't even find words how disturbing it is.

TUCHMAN: Corrine Rovetti is a nurse practitioner and one of the other co-directors of this clinic which provides all types of gynecological healthcare.

ROVETTI: What kind of society is it that that we force people to motherhood when they're not ready or prepared to do that, or know that they're already stretched to their limits and cannot support another child?

TUCHMAN: Under a Tennessee law passed in 2019, if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe versus Wade, this state will then ban abortion 30 days after the ruling is issued. Exceptions will only be allowed to prevent the death of a pregnant woman or a serious injury.

Dr. Aaron Campbell is one of the physicians who performs abortions here. He is the medical director.

AARON CAMPBELL, MEDICAL DIRECTOR, KNOXVILLE CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH: I think people will pursue unsafe illegal abortions, and I think people will get sick and die. And I think their blood and deaths will be on the hands of these lawmakers that are passing these laws.

TUCHMAN: Dr. Campbell's late father was also the medical director here for many years.

CAMPBELL: I think he would be devastated.

TUCHMAN: There are very few places that provide abortions in Tennessee. There was another clinic just a few miles away from here.

CAMPBELL: On New Year's Eve our local Planned Parenthood affiliate was burned down, ruled to be an arson.

TUCHMAN: And it hasn't reopened?

CAMPBELL: It hasn't reopened. It's not been rebuilt.

TUCHMAN: Doing this type of work has long been intimidating and often frightening for the medical professionals. Many of the patients who come here for routine checkups do it partly out of support and loyalty for the clinic, Lisa being one of them. And she shares the employees' emotions about what the Supreme Court seems poised to do.

UNKNOWN: It makes me angry.

TUCHMAN: For now, the anti-abortion protesters say they will continue to be here.

UNKNOWN: We're not here to intimidate people. We're here to --

(CROSSTALK)

TUCHMAN: But you do, and you know that.

UNKNOWN: Well, if the child is outside the womb, we wouldn't be acting like this.

TUCHMAN: And the clinic employees say they will continue to do their jobs. But they know the writing is on the wall and that perhaps there is now not much they can do about it.

[03:50:00]

What are you going to start telling your patients?

CAMPBELL: I don't know. I don't know that any of us know.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

TUCHMAN: I just talked to one of the other co-directors of this clinic. She says she was born in 1979 which was six years after Roe became the law of the land. She says she finds it incomprehensible that Roe will no longer exist, and that's one of the reasons she believes she still has hope that one of the conservative justices might change his or her mind.

This is Gary Tuchman, CNN in Knoxville, Tennessee.

CHURCH: And U.S. House Democrat Pramila Jayapal is an ardent supporter of Roe. She told CNN how her own experience shaped her view of abortion rights. And says she is grateful to live in Washington state where the right to choose is protected.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): I have always been a supporter of abortion rights, but when I had to go through the experience itself, it gave me a whole different perspective on the nuances and the complexities of making a decision like this, and also the incredible importance of having it be for nobody else to make except the pregnant person.

Because at the end of the day, we are the people that know what we're dealing with. Nobody could have known the incredibly difficult situation that I had had with my first child being born just 1 pound, 14 ounces. I mean, literally she was this big, the size of a small squash. And I had so many issues for months with not even knowing if she was going to live or die.

And so, to then have somebody else tell me that I have to have a government mandated pregnancy when I knew that I was not in a position to do that, I think all came into sharp focus. And so, now today, I see so many stories, and there isn't a good story, a good abortion story or a bad abortion story. It's just the choice that women have to make about their own bodies, and nobody else should be involved in that, other than our doctors and our loved ones.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CHURCH: The congresswoman went on to say outlawing abortion is way out of step with what the American people want. Polls show the majority support Roe v. Wade.

Well, we are learning new details about the shocking onstage attack of comedian Dave Chapelle in Los Angeles Tuesday night. The suspect is now in custody, but a motive is still unknown.

CNN's Nick Watt has the latest.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

NICK WATT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Dave Chappelle was introducing the next act. Suddenly, a comic colossus tackled by a man who rushed the stage, wielding a knife shaped like a replica gun.

RACHEL CRANE, CNN INNOVATION & SPACE CORRESPONDENT: I mean, he rammed right into him.

WATT: CNN's Rachel Crane was just a few feet away, sitting in the second row.

CRANE: One second, you're laughing and the next second, honestly, I was fearing for my life, because I thought that perhaps this man had a bomb in that backpack on his back.

WATT: He did not, and Chappelle was not injured, according to the LAPD, quickly cracking jokes. The 23-year-old male suspect was hurt in the melee, taken to the hospital and arrested for assault with a deadly weapon. Any motive remains unclear.

Chappelle, in his recent Netflix special does note that he angers a lot of people with his comedy.

DAVE CHAPPELLE, COMEDIAN: Now listen, women get mad at me, gay people get mad at me, lesbians get mad at me. But I'm going to tell you right now, this is true, these transgenders, these (muted) they just want me dead.

WATT: This assault took place just about a mile away from another recent on-stage attack on a comedian. The infamous Oscars slap. Last night, Chris Rock was also performing, soon by Chappelle's side, making reference, cutting the tension.

CHRIS ROCK, COMEDIAN: Was that will smith?

WATT: So, still unclear why this happened and maybe more importantly, how this happened.

CRANE: It felt like an eternity before the security got there and, you know, intervened. In actuality, I'm sure it was just a few seconds, but it was a very charged moment and everybody -- there were gasps, screams. (END VIDEOTAPE)

WATT: Also still unclear, how this suspect could have gotten a knife into the Hollywood Bowl through past the metal detection, particularly with so many high-profile performers and guests in attendance. Also, ironic that earlier in his set, Chappelle was joking about having to increase security at his home after somebody was hanging around on the street and shouting at him.

[03:54:56]

A spokesperson for Dave Chappelle tells CNN that he, quote, "refuses to let this overshadow the magic of his shows here at the bowl."

Nick Watt, CNN, Hollywood.

CHURCH: It has been nearly a week into the search for an Alabama correctional officer and the inmate she's accused of helping escape from jail. Officer Vicky White and inmate Casey White were last seen leaving a detention facility last Friday. The two are not related.

Now the Lauderdale County sheriff is urging the correctional officer to turn herself in. A warrant was issued for Vicky White's arrest on charges of permitting or facilitating escape in the first degree.

And thank you so much for spending part of your day with me. I'm Rosemary Church. Our breaking news coverage of the war in Ukraine continues next. Do stay with CNN.

“Check against delivery”

Dear Johannes, dear Governor Haslauer,

Ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning to you all. It is a pleasure to be in Salzburg today to attend this renowned event, hosted by my friend and colleague, Commissioner Hahn.

30 years ago, following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the political scientist Francis Fukuyama famously proclaimed that we had reached “the end of history”, marking the cessation of ideological conflict in the global order.

Western liberal democracy, he argued, represented the unchallenged final stage of human evolution.

But as the current geopolitical context regrettably underlines, democracy and the rules-based order remain under pressure.

With Russia’s brutal aggression against Ukraine, we see old, failed ideas re-emerging, seeking to threaten the security architecture of our continent, and beyond.

But we also see the resolve and resilience of the Western world and its partners, most clearly demonstrated by the bravery and determination of the Ukrainian people.

We in the rest of Europe have likewise shown that we will do everything in our power to protect and nurture our model of peaceful democratic governance.

It is therefore important that, even as the tragedy in Ukraine unfolds, we in the West reflect on our role in this emerging era of disorder, and start to imagine what a new world order might look like, while making the strong case for common rules stemming from democratic values.

This pressure on democracy and values cannot come as a total surprise. Already last year, the 2021 Strategic Foresight Report adopted by the European Commission, pointed towards a global decline in democratic governance.

Countries that can be defined as liberal democracies have dwindled over the past decade from 41 to 32, representing a global population share of just 14 percent.

A number of G20 nations are among the top ten decliners, with the path towards autocracy typically following a similar pattern – from attacking the media and civil society first, to polarising societies by disrespecting opponents and spreading disinformation, and finally to undermining formal institutions.

Democratisation is still occurring but small countries dominate this trend.

We live in an era when literally everything – from technology to large-scale disinformation – can be used as an instrument of power, both domestically and externally, by deliberately targeting the weakening of democratic systems.

These factors all point towards to the need to strengthen the resilience of our public institutions. Therefore, it is essential that the rule of law remains the bedrock for everything the European Union does.

That will never change, which is something perhaps not fully understood in places like Moscow – but is grasped so vigorously in Kyiv.

* In response to these challenges, we must ensure that we are better prepared for whatever lies ahead.

In this atmosphere of turmoil, with war on our very doorstep and the pandemic still simmering in the background, we need solution-driven policies paired with the ability to act fast.

The EU and its partners in the West have demonstrated this consistently, and repeatedly, over the past months and years.

But the war in Ukraine speaks to a wider truth about our future and we must already look to draw lessons from the conflict.

* I already see three areas where we need to reconsider our current thinking.

First, we are seeing a step change in defence and security in the EU, with an increasing number of NATO members looking to meet the spending commitment of two percent of GDP – a particular point of contention with Washington under the Trump administration.

And, of course, recent events have prompted countries like Sweden and Finland to rethink their approach to membership of NATO, something almost unthinkable a few short months ago.

Moreover, we, in the EU, are set to be more strategic in terms of defence capabilities – be it through the Strategic Compass, or a package put forward by the Commission to move us towards a more integrated and competitive European defence market.

Second, we need to take a more geopolitical perspective when it comes to the twin green and digital transitions – the core of our upcoming Strategic Foresight Report.

Consider this: Europe is rightly striving to reduce its dependence on Russian energy. Last year, the EU imported more than 40 percent of its total gas consumption from Russia, along with 27 percent of oil imports and 46 percent of coal imports.

But our over-dependence on imports of the critical raw materials needed for the technology to power the twin transition is much more extreme, up to 99 percent in some instances – often from third countries, such as China, which cannot be counted on to share our values and do not shy away from using Europe’s dependence as a tool of geopolitical influence.

In response, I am convinced that we must embed open strategic autonomy in all that we do.

This includes the need to urgently scale-up Europe’s primary critical raw materials industry, including by creating a Strategic European Project (SEP) label for the most valuable critical raw materials projects in Europe.

We have also doubled down on diversification by creating strategic partnerships with like-minded trade partners.

I remain firmly of the conviction that the transatlantic bond – now re-invigorated – remains the most natural for us, given our shared values.

As someone who grew up behind the Iron Curtain, I personally appreciate this bond all the more, especially as more and more parts of our economies and societies have taken on a security dimension.

In addition, tectonic geopolitical shifts, together with the pandemic, are speeding up changes in supply chains, in favour of shorter and less vulnerable ones wherever possible. Under this trend, often dubbed reverse ‘glocalisation’, companies are beginning to rebalance their local and global activities in the face of supply risks and increasing protectionism.

Third, we need to be much more strategic about our enlargement policy, as is clearly the case with Ukraine.

It is equally critical that we take care not to lose our other neighbours – especially in the Western Balkans – to the political influence or assertive economy policy of China, Russia or other systemic rivals.

That does not mean, however, that we should act in a similarly single-handed way. We should aim for a multi-lateral world rather than one which is multi-polar.

We should invest in our partnerships around the world, such as with Africa and Latin America. Because those partnerships will come under pressure.

This challenge is already evident in the ongoing battle of narratives over the impacts of the war in Ukraine –for example, on Russia’s false claims that it is Western sanction that are responsible for the knock-on effects on global food supplies.

* Ladies and gentlemen,

More and more I hear the term BUNI – short for ‘brittle, anxious, non-linear and incomprehensible’ – to describe the complexity and chaotic nature of our modern reality.

To succeed in the face of this unpredictability, we need to make full use of strategic foresight, embedding a long-term perspective into all major policy initiatives under this Commission.

As part of that effort, we have stepped up our work on megatrends, with our Joint Research Centre monitoring 14 driving forces that will have the most significant impact on the EU and its Member States.

In addition, our new horizon scanning project helps us identify early signs of change that are not yet on the radar of policymakers. Once every quarter, our experts draw up a list of “new trends” to catch their attention.

For instance, we see clear signs that the semiconductor industry is on the verge of a new super-cycle.

Through the miniaturisation process, the capability of chips per dollar spent has already increased 67-thousand-fold since 1990.

However, the technological limits of current transistor architecture will be reached by 2030. Therefore, the most likely trend will be a shift away from miniaturisation and towards new technologies and materials to offset the upcoming physical limitations.

A tangible example of how strategic foresight has informed the Commission’s priorities is the recent European Chips Act, aimed at doubling the EU’s market share in the global semiconductor sector to 20 percent by 2030.

Similarly, fintech is currently undergoing a transformative process akin to a super-cycle, with global revenues set to hit 670 billion euros by 2030.

At the same time, crypto-assets and their underlying technology, blockchain, will be disruptive factors over the coming decade, not only in financial services but also in many other sectors.

The World Economic Forum has estimated that, by 2027, 10 percent of global GDP could be stored on blockchain technology.

Likewise, we should use foresight capacities to build a good understanding of the needs of businesses when it comes to insurance products in the post-pandemic environment and in the face of increasing effects of climate change, another major trend affecting our lives.

* In conclusion, let me reiterate that current geopolitical events serve as a catalyst; a wake-up call to foster Europe’s resilience in all its dimensions.

In this way, we can ensure that – regardless of whether Fukuyama’s prophecy about the supposed ‘end of history’ comes true or not – the future will be as European as possible, no matter what it holds.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to listening to Ivan Krastev and to our following discussion.

The Russian Luge Federation (FSSR) has claimed it is still awaiting the payment of prize money to athletes from the last Luge World Cup season.

The organisation raised concerns in March over prize money due to athletes, after the International Luge Federation (FIL) banned all Russian athletes, coaches and officials from its events in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

The FIL Court of Arbitration overturned the sanction last month, but the governing body is seeking other avenues to find new ways to ban Russian athletes.

Statute changes, which would allow for increased sanctioning powers, are expected to be discussed at the FIL Congress next month, due to be held on June 18 and 19 in TIrol, Austria.

FSSR executive director Stanislav Tyurin previously said its athletes normally received their prize money in April.

Tyurin told Russia's official state news agency TASS that payments are yet to be made.

"This issue has not yet been resolved," Tyurin said.

Russian athletes secured 11 podium finishes during the World Cup season.

Roman Repilov earned two podium finishes on the men’s circuit.

Beijing 2022 bronze medallist Tatiana Ivanova secured a sprint win and a third place in the Women’s World Cup, with Victoria Demchenko also earning a third place finish.

Russia also enjoyed success in the doubles and team relay circuits during the season.

Russian officials including Executive Board member Natalia Garth were excluded from their positions at the FIL Extraordinary Congress last month.

Albert Demchenko, Alexander Shakhnazarov and Gennady Rodionov also lost their positions on FIL working groups.

A motion to expel the FSSR following the invasion of Ukraine failed to secure the required two-thirds majority.

The FSSR has said it has appealed against the exclusion of their officials from FIL positions.

"The Arbitration Court received our appeal," Tyurin told TASS.

"But the date of consideration has not yet been determined.

"We expect that the claim will be considered before mid-June, when the next FIL Congress takes place."

(Vindobona) The Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union met in Brussels. The Russian war of aggression on Ukraine and the planned sixth sanctions package against Russia in response to it were central topics.

The main focus of the debate on May 16, 2022, was the current Russian aggression and the next planned (sixth) package of sanctions in order to try to stop the conflict. Foreign Ministers of Canada (Mélanie Joly ), Ukraine (Dmytro Kuleba ) and Austria (Alexander Schallenberg ) have agreed that the current war in Ukraine could have an effect on the Western Balkan Region.

The foreign ministers of this region have had an informal meeting on the sidelines of the Council, to consult with their colleagues regarding this situation.

The main focus of the Ministers was to emphasize the unity of the European Union regarding the current situation between Russia and Ukraine. As part of the sanction package, an oil embargo was mentioned, but for this measure to be effective, unity of the Ministers is required.

On the behalf of the Slavkov format (Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Minister Schallenberg emphasized the importance of negotiation progress regarding the visa liberalization for Kosovo and the integration of Northern Macedonia into the European Union .

This conference will be continued in the following days, but the main topics are not expected to change. The EU priorities are clear: Avoiding the spread of the already bloody conflict in Ukraine, being that the Western Balkan Region is still considered an area of dispute between the EU and Russia.

MEPs urge sanctioning the likes of ex-chancellor Schröder

Former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder and Austria's ex-foreign minister Karin Kneissl came under fire on Thursday (19 May) — after the European Parliament urged EU countries to sanction them for their close Kremlin ties.

In the resolution, MEPs said Schröder should be blacklisted if he does not quit the

board of Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft and not take a top job at Gazprom's board, which he was nominated for in February.

The non-bonding resolution also mentioned Kneissl, who was a minister under the government of Sebastian Kurz, and has danced with Russian president Vladimir Putin at her wedding.

MEPs urged the EU to "extend the list of individuals targeted by EU sanctions to the European members of the boards of major Russian companies and to politicians who continue to receive Russian money".

The resolution[https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2022-0219_EN.html] "notes that former politicians such as Esko Aho, Francois Fillon and Wolfgang Schüssel have recently resigned from their positions in Russian firms" and "strongly demands" that Kneissl and Schröder do the same.

The resolution, which passed on Thursday with 575 votes in favour and the support of the four biggest parties in the parliament, builds pressure on European politicians who have taken up key roles in Russian state companies.

However, it is up to the unanimous decision of the 27 EU governments to add people to the sanctions list.

Schröder headed the German government as a Social Democrat chancellor from 1998 to 2005, and has later worked for the pipeline company Nord Stream and Russia's Gazprom.

Kneissl works as a blogger for Russian Today, which has been banned in the EU, and sits on the supervisory board of Rosneft.

"By serving in top positions of Kremlin-affiliated corporations, the former Austrian foreign minister Karin Kneissl and former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder are de facto closely cooperating with Russia," centre-right German MEP Markus Ferber said.

"Such behaviour is unacceptable at a time when Russia is breaking international law and committing war crimes," Feber said, adding that MEPs ask the two politicians to step down.

Spanish liberal MEP Luis Garicano said it is "outrageous" that Gerhard Schröder continues to get paid for his position in Rosneft. "Being a former chancellor should not shield him from being sanctioned".

"Let's end this impunity," he added.

The MEPs call for sanctions follows a decision by the current Berlin government to cut back Schröder's perks he enjoys as ex-chancellor.

Liberal finance minister Christian Lindner said it was unthinkable that a former chancellor who is now "openly doing lobby work for the criminal rule of Vladimir Putin is still given an office by taxpayers," Deutsche Welle reported.

In an unapologetic interview with the New York Times, Schröder defended Putin, claiming that the orders to murder civilians in Bucha, around Kyiv, had not come from the Russian president, but from military commanders on the ground.

The resolution urges EU governments to extend the list of blacklisted individuals to include Russian oligarchs, taking into account the list of 6,000 individuals put together by the foundation of opposition figure Alexei Navalny, who is currently held in a Russian prison camp.

MEPs also call for an extension of EU-sanctioned Russian-affiliated media entities operating in the EU, "specifically the GRU-affiliated 'news agency' InfoRos".

The EU has so far blacklisted 1,093 individuals and 80 entities because of the war on Ukraine.

EU agrees on oil embargo against Russia

Brussels/Kyiv(Kiev)/Moscow - The EU has agreed on a sixth sanction package against Russia which includes an oil embargo, which was hotly disputed for several weeks. This was according to EU Council President Charles Michel on Twitter on Monday night. Austria was among those who dragged their feet until the last moment, and Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer (conservative People's Party, VP) did not comment after the first day of the EU summit.

On Monday night, Michel tweeted "#Unity. Agreement to ban export of Russian oil to the EU. This immediately covers more than 2/3 of oil imports from Russia, cutting a huge source of financing for its war machine. Maximum pressure on Russia to end the war".

The Council president and EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen expressed relief at a press conference after the first day of the summit. It had taken several weeks to reach this decision, and there was already speculation that the EU lacked cohesion, said Michel. Strong political leadership was needed in these times. Especially Hungary had blocked the oil embargo for weeks, and demanded compensation.

The breakthrough was surprising, after the EU heads still emphasised their disagreement at the start of the summit. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban originally positioned himself against a compromise presented ahead of the summit which would have allowed Russian oil deliveries via pipelines. Orban said he welcomed the pipeline exception, but demanded additional guarantees, and received support for this demand from Nehammer. The Austrian chancellor said he understood the "concerns" of the neighbouring country and also referred to Austria's heavy reliance on Russian gas.

BERLIN. May 31 (Interfax) - The European Union is not planning to impose a natural gas embargo on Russia, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said.

"A gas embargo won't be part of the next sanction package," Nehammer told journalists in Brussels on Tuesday.

The heads of state and government of the EU countries agreed upon an embargo on two-thirds of oil imported from Russia early on Tuesday. President of the European Council Charles Michel said that, as expected, the sixth package of sanctions against Russia includes disconnecting Sberbank from SWIFT.

Vienna/Brussels - Chancellor Karl Nehammer (conservative People's Party, VP) has once again emphasised his rejection of an EU embargo against Russian gas. "The gas embargo will not be an issue, also not in the next sanction package", said Nehammer on the sidelines of an EU summit meeting in Brussels.

Gas was entirely different in the question of supply reliability than oil, said the chancellor. "Oil can be substituted far more easily, if one waives Russian oil".

Nehammer said that he welcomed the EU partial import ban on Russian oil, which was reached overnight Tuesday. It was a measure that would certainly be painful for the member states, said the chancellor. But the "pain we suffer is nothing in comparison" to what the Ukrainian people were feeling.

Technical issues still needed to be solved, said Nehammer. It would still be some time until a compromise was reached, he said.

Main themes on selected current affairs programmes on Austrian TV on 27-30 May

The approval of the European Union of its sixth package of sanctions, including a partial oil embargo, against Russia, the citizenship legislation, the end to petrol tourism, and various political scandals, dominated the media headlines in Austria during the review period and the agenda for the main Austrian television talk shows, commercial broadcaster ATV's ATV Aktuell: Die Woche, public broadcaster ORF's ZIB2, commercial channel OE24's Fellner! Live, and commercial broadcaster Puls 24's Puls 24 News.

On commercial broadcaster ATV's Sunday evening talk show ATV aktuell: Die Woche, moderator Meinrad Knapp, political expert Thomas Hofer and pollster Peter Hajek reviewed the political week and analysed the main stories of the past 7 days.

New week, new scandal

In the past week, Austria's political scene was hit by a new political scandal. The ruling party came under fire again. After the Vorarlberg Wirtschaftsbund affair, this time another sub-organisation of the OeVP landed in a dubious spotlight. The Austrian Senior Citizens' Association collected almost two million euros in coronavirus aid from the "Non-Profit Organisations Support Fund" - although parties and their sub-organisations were excluded from it.

"I can't talk about the legal side here and I can't judge whether the matter will have any consequences. But what's devastating here is how it looks," thought Thomas Hofer. "You can't write into the law that political institutions don't get any help from this pot and then you split hairs with the non-profit associations and the senior citizens' association." While it might have been legal, it was certainly inappropriate in a phase, when the wave of inflation was making life difficult not only for those on low wages, but also for the middle class, the political expert elaborated. From the point of view of the target groups of the OeVP, "that is very grim", he said. From the party's point of view, this all came at a very inconvenient time. "Everything you can do wrong, has been done wrong".

"Of course, there is nothing for Federal Chancellor Karl Nehammer to gain in this situation," thought Peter Hajek. "In normal circumstances he would have to lead the way in clearing up the matter. But there is a perpetuum mobile running here".

OeVP's special problem

The question that the OeVP as an organisation as a whole had to ask itself was, according to Hajek, whether it had a very special problem. They didn't seem to know where the red lines were. While the legal side here was still debatable, the moral and ethical limits had been crossed and it was an ongoing process at the OeVP. Hajek proposed to set up a working group that examined the entire organisation and structure and identifies possible problem areas. "The OeVP, which is fighting for the voters' favour and dreams of 28-30%, will foot the bill here," said the pollster.

Greens under pressure

The Corona aid from the NPO Fund, which went to associations in five federal states associated with the OeVP Senior Citizens' Association, will be investigated by Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler from the Green party - OeVP's coalition partner.

According to Hofer, the Greens were "of course under pressure". Werner Kogler could refer to the formalities and conduct the investigation, "which may lead to at least part of the money being repaid". The situation in the Voralbergerland was more delicate for the Greens, since the investigations could not be stretched out indefinitely, thought Hofer. "The scandals surrounding the OeVP can become a burden for the Greens, but the Greens certainly do not want to step out of government responsibility either".

Enormous challenges for Austrians, polls

As of 1 June, the mask requirement to contain the corona pandemic was largely lifted. According to Hajek, the vast majority of the Austrian population, regarded the corona pandemic and the Ukraine war as a personal burden. Only a quarter of Austrians did not feel stressed at all by the current situation. "The current situation poses an enormous challenge for many people," said Hajek. "Two years of pandemic and far from over, and then a war in the immediate vicinity has made the Austrians realize that peace, prosperity and health cannot be taken for granted ."

Political expert Hofer acknowledged that the government was giving in to the "will of the people". Hofer also understood those professional groups who did not want to spend eight and more hours a day wearing masks. But in autumn it would be difficult for the government to explain to the country convincingly why the restrictions were being reintroduced. " Here I am not talking about the mask, which is an easier topic, but about vaccinations," said Hofer.

Viennese deviation

The Vienna state government announced that it would deviate from the mask exemption of the federal government. Mayor Michael Ludwig (SPOe) said after a meeting of his crisis team, FFP2 masks would still need to be worn in public transport, pharmacies, surgeries and hospitals. The city mayor pointed out that these were particularly vulnerable settings and referred to his successful previous safety-first policies in Vienna during the entire corona crisis.

Hajek recalled that Vienna had maintained a very stringent policy through the pandemic and Mayor Ludwig and his City Councillor for Health, Peter Hacker, continued to follow that stringent line. "Politically, this is fundamentally wise, because it creates a recognition value for the voter, unlike this flip-flopper syndrome, and is therefore understandable to the population," the pollster said. But Hajek found it difficult to answer whether it ultimately brought plus or minus points. The Viennese SPOe was well positioned at just under 50% and the mask that you had to wear in the subway would change little about that. In autumn or late summer we would see, he continued, how quickly the city of Vienna would progress. "I could imagine that the booster vaccinations will start as early as August," Hajek concluded.

Debating new citizenship law and abolition of presidency

In an interview with local media, Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen, who is running a re-election campaign, said he believed the hurdles for citizenship were too high.

Peter Hajek presented the results of his latest opinion poll. He had asked 500 Austrians whether they would agree or disagree to abolish the office of Federal President and instead have the Federal Chancellor elected in a direct election by the population. The Federal Chancellor would then put together his own government and submit it to the elected National Council (Parliament).

"The question is daring because there is currently no public discussion about it and the respondents have not dealt with the topic," commented Hajek. "The advantage of such a far-reaching change would be a stable government without a shaky coalition and without permanent discussions about new election."

However, only a strong third (37%) of those surveyed, representative of the Austrian population, were in favour of abolishing the office of Federal President. 17 per cent would "very much" and 20 per cent "rather" agree to an abolition. But the majority of respondents backed the Federal President: 48% of those surveyed said they would retain the office and agreed to the proposal for abolition, "rather not" (21%) or "not at all" (27%). Some 15% of respondents had no opinion on this issue.

The poll showed major differences among the groups of voters: while the majority of 57 per cent of FPÖ voters were "very" or "rather" in favour of abolishing the office of Federal President, only 17 per cent of the Greens voters could imagine this.

Slow investigation of corruption scandal

After the resignation of his predecessor Sebastian Kurz due to corruption charges and taking over as Federal Chancellor in late 2021, Karl Nehammer and his ruling conservative Austrian People's Party (OeVP), have been rocketed by one scandal after another. Wolfgang Sobotka, the current president of the National Council, has been heading a committee of inquiry into allegations of corruption against his own party but messages from his mobile phone chats that were made public showed that he might have interfered with the allocation of key posts in the police force. Now the OeVP is pushing the investigation for the fastest possible evaluation of all chats - including those of politicians from the opposition Social Democartic Party (SPOe).

In an interview with public broadcaster ORF's news talk show ZIB2 on 29 May at 2000gmt, the Minister of Justice, Alma Zadic from the Green Party, gave an update of her work.

Alma Zadic categorically rejected allegations by Andreas Hanger, parliamentary group leader of the OeVP in the Committee of Inquiry, according to which the Ministry of Justice was delaying the evaluation of mobile phone chats by the former head of the state holding company ÖBAG, Thomas Schmid, with various SPOe politicians: "We will deliver all chats".

The only criterion for handing over the chats was "the chronology. The chats that came first are treated first." Those handed over by Hanger three months later would be evaluated three months later.

Chats investigated by chronology

Zadic spoke of "hundreds of thousands of messages" that would have to be processed one after the other. At the end of each month, all freshly evaluated chats would be made available.

When asked by ZiB2 moderator Martin Thur whether the suspension of chief public prosecutor Johann Fuchs was a mistake, Zadic said: that she still stood by her decision. "There was a legally binding indictment. As a minister, I felt compelled to act", although "of course" she accepted that the Supreme Court had later lifted the suspension.

The minister also rejected the repeated criticism against her person from the legal protection officer in the judiciary, Gabriele Aicher, who had since resigned. The minister didn't want to hear anything about what Aicher had found to be "hit lists in the judiciary." In terms of content, she did not intervene with Aicher. She had the conversation with her for a different reason. "I wasn't satisfied with the media work beforehand," said Zadic. "The independence of the judiciary must be visible internally and externally. But I'm not telling Aicher how to do her job."

When asked about the Federal President's offensive to relax citizenship law, Zadic said: "We see it the way the Federal President does; we can of course imagine easing it." But there was no parliamentary majority for easing, so this could not be enforced in the current legislative period.

EU embargo on Russian oil

On 30 May, the European Union agreed to a partial embargo on Russian oil imports. Setting the scene for a new clash over further sanctions, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said that there could be no question of suspending gas imports because of the effect on major European economies.

On commercial channel OE24's talk show Fellner! Live on 31 May at 2000gmt, two columnists, authors and former politicians, Sebastian Bohrn Mena and Gerald Grosz, clashed over the decision from Brussels to ban Russian oil and the Western support for Ukraine.

Sebastian Bohrn Mena was "glad that the European Union agreed on the oil embargo, even though Viktor Orban has once again taken advantage on the back of Ukrainian misery". If 90% of oil imports were stopped by the end of the year, it would hurt Russia, he said, although it would take a while due to various global warning currents, but Bohrn Mena considered it an important step and also an important symbolic act.

Europe's economic-political suicide

Gerald Grosz who had recently stated his ambition to run in the Presidential elections, interpreted the oil embargo as a "further piece of the jigsaw on the way to Europe's economic-political suicide".

If you looked closely what EU President Ursula von der Leyen had come up with, Grosz argued, it was "nothing more than a sleaze show, as agreeing on an oil embargo because we are not dependent on it", but at the same time allowing unimpeded imports through the pipeline to Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Croatia, was not a sanction, but at best a "tranquilizer pill intended to reassure us that the EU is once again divided on this issue". Despite many promises, he continued, the sanctions on Russia seemed to have had no effect so far. Why should the sixth package of sanctions take effect when the first five didn't, Grosz asked rhetorically and provided the answer himself: "Okay, the sanctions had an effect: our inflation now reached at 8%, we are sliding towards the greatest economic catastrophe since World War II, fuel prices are going up. If the Russians turn off the gas for us, then within seven days, there will be no more automobile industry because of the aluminium production in Europe, and we can stop all newspaper editions after three days because paper can no longer be produced".

Grosz said that apparently Europe wanted to plunge its own people into misery in view of the misery in Ukraine, while "the cherry picker, Viktor Orban, did something right. Let the French, the Italians, the Brits ... , but he won't let the Hungarian people be hit by an economic atomic bomb, and that would have been an oil embargo that included the pipeline". According to Grosz, now Ukraine had it in its own hands whether or not to blow up the pipeline that ran through its territory, if it wanted to bring Mr Orban to see reason. "But, of course, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky won't do that, because he is getting a billion USD for the oil transits from this despot whom he is so angry about because he slaughters his people, the Ukrainians." In these hours, Grosz continued, on the 90th day of the war, we were experiencing a great deal of hypocrisy and the only substratum of this hypocrisy was that Austrians and all other Europeans were doing even worse economically, that they were getting into social difficulties and that, as a result, they would also get into democratic and political difficulties, since the peoples would not put up with this much longer.

End to petrol tourism in Hungary

In Hungary, on 27 May, the national-conservative government put an end to petrol tourism. Drivers with foreign licence plates were no longer able to buy fuel at Hungarian petrol stations at discounted prices and instead had to pay market prices and thus significantly more for petrol and diesel.

Tank tourism had flourished in Hungary in recent months. The price freeze for petrol and diesel fuel, originally introduced in mid-November, had already been extended twice and is valid until the beginning of July. Refuelling in transit and by commuters who deliberately drove to Hungary from neighbouring countries to fill up their cars had increased fuel sales significantly in recent months. A litre of petrol or diesel costs the equivalent of 1.24 euros. In Austria, the prices are currently around 1.70 euros and more. Therefore, a 60-litre tank filling was around 30 euros and thus around a quarter cheaper in Hungary.

However, on commercial broadcaster Puls 24's news programme Puls 24 News on 27 May at 1755 gmt, Walter Obwexer, Professor for European Law at the University of Innsbruck, argued that Hungary was likely to be violating the EU principle of equal treatment.

"This measure, which bases a payment from car license plates, is an indirect discrimination on the grounds of nationality, because Hungarian citizens primarily have Hungarian car license plates and citizens from other EU member states have not. Such indirect discrimination is in principle prohibited under Union law. But it can take years for a lawsuit to be successful."

The United States on Tuesday blamed Iran for the failure of both sides in reviving the 2015 nuclear deal during a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'s governors in Vienna

united states blames iran's demands on sanction-lifting for failure to revive 2015 nuclear deal[https://static.tnn.in/thumb/msid-92069560,imgsize-28244,width-1280,height-720/92069560.jpg]

Vienna: The United States on Tuesday blamed Iran for the failure of both sides in reviving the 2015 nuclear deal. The US said that Iran's demands on sanctions-lifting were stalling the progress in reaching an agreement on reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, reported news agency Reuters.

After a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'s governors in Vienna, the US issued a statement criticising Iran. The US, in the statement, said that Iran would need to drop demands for sanctions lifting.

The statement reads, "What we need is a willing partner in Iran. In particular, Iran would need to drop demands for sanctions lifting that clearly go beyond the JCPOA and that are now preventing us from concluding a deal."

Earlier in the day, the US along with Britain, Germany and France also submitted a draft resolution to the U.N. nuclear watchdog's board.

The resolution condemned Tehran for not fully answering the watchdog's questions on uranium traces at undeclared sites, reported the news agency. The resolution is expected to be passed easily.

The 2015 Iran nuclear deal is known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). It is an agreement between Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States, the European Union and Germany. The agreement was signed in Vienna in July 2015.

However, in 2018, the US pulled out of the deal. Then-President Donald Trump had said that he would negotiate a better deal.

The Green Brief: EU Parliament hit by ‘tsunami of lobbying’]]

Greetings and welcome to EURACTIV’s Green Brief. Below you’ll find the latest roundup of news covering energy & environment from across Europe. You can subscribe to the weekly newsletter here[https://www.euractiv.com/subscribe-to-the-green-brief/].

It’s a well-known aspect of EU law-making: When key legislation comes to the European Parliament, MEPs become the target of lobbyists of all kinds seeking to influence them.

However, the amount of lobbying happening right now with the EU’s current crop of 2030 climate laws might be unprecedented.

“I can share a fact – it’s a tsunami of lobbying,” said Pascal Canfin, the chairman of the Parliament’s environment committee who oversees the passage of key files under the EU’s ‘Fit for 55’ climate plan.

‘Fit for 55’ refers to the EU’s target of reducing global warming emissions by at least 55% before the end of this decade and is part of wider EU plans to reduce emissions to net-zero by 2050. Both targets were enshrined into a European Climate Law[https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/breakthrough-as-eu-negotiators-clinch-deal-on-european-climate-law/] last year, making them legally-binding objectives for the European Union and its 27 member states.

But as Parliament prepares to vote today on detailed legislative proposals[https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/parliaments-biggest-group-rejects-compromise-on-eu-carbon-border-tax/] to meet these objectives, MEPs are facing a formidable pushback by industries ranging from automakers to steelmakers and chemical manufacturers.

The automotive sector alone held 32 meetings with MEPs working on the EU’s proposed car CO2 legislation between September and March, according to data compiled by InfluenceMap[https://influencemap.org/report/The-Automotive-Sector-and-Climate-Change-18218], a non-profit group.

And the vast majority – 22 meetings – were held with trade associations or companies opposed to EU plans for ending the sale of petrol and diesel cars, with six with supportive voices, and four mixed.

Similarly, records from MEPs dealing with the reform of the EU’s carbon market[https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/CBAM-EU-ETS-MEP-Meetings-Data_31.05.2022-FINAL.pdf] show 52 meetings were held since EU lawmakers were appointed to lead on the file. German steelmaker Thyssenkrupp, steel association Eurofer, and the Federation of German Industries (BDI) were the groups that met the most frequently with MEPs, public records show.

And according to InfluenceMap[https://europe.influencemap.org/policy], these groups are generally opposed to EU plans for ending the current system whereby industries receive most of their CO2 pollution credits for free.

Of course, there is nothing wrong with lobbying as such, Canfin emphasised.

“We are in a democracy, we are in a market economy, it’s legitimate for a company to say ‘I don’t like it’,” he told a press briefing last week.

“But if you take all the lobbying positions of all the industries and put them together, you don’t arrive at -55%, you probably arrive at +30,” he quipped.

“To be honest, it’s irresponsible,” he said.

In an op-ed published in French daily Le Monde[https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2022/06/02/pascal-canfin-a-entendre-certaines-grandes-entreprises-l-action-climatique-c-est-bien-mais-surtout-pour-les-autres_6128710_3232.html], Canfin singled out German carmaker BMW and trade association Eurofer for seeking to “torpedo” the EU’s ‘Fit for 55’ climate package.

Trade associations are often seen as the worst because they tend to align with the least ambitious of their corporate members.

This has led some companies to question associations like BusinessEurope, which has been described by some as “reflecting very much an extreme lowest common denominator”[https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/leaked-memo-exposes-business-rift-on-climate-change/] among the business community.

“The evidence overwhelmingly shows ambitious climate policies can drive economic recovery,” said Ursula Woodburn, head of EU relations at CLG Europe, a group of businesses lobbying to accelerate climate action. “In this context, attempts to weaken the reach and ambition of the ‘Fit for 55’ file of legislative measures are a retrograde step. We are already late to the climate crisis, and to hold up the progress in this package places short-term returns over long-term economic and social stability.”

Canfin is not the only MEP denouncing pressure from lobby groups.

Others, like Michael Bloss[https://twitter.com/micha_bloss/status/1533019252868907011?s=20&t=XE6ipom3QOo2tW-5mAg8_w] (Greens, Germany) and Delara Burkhardt[https://twitter.com/delarabur/status/1534085180461309952?s=20&t=E7tSTu1AnT9kcDY4CoV3mw] (S&D, Germany) have also complained about pressures from parts of industry which they say “are using people’s fears” about food shortages or high energy prices to scale back the ambition of the EU’s ‘Fit for 55’ package.

Worse still, company CEOs may sometimes take green stances in public speeches while their public affairs representatives in Brussels defend opposite positions in closed-door meetings with EU policymakers, Canfin said.

“That’s what I tell students: before joining a company, look at their public affairs positions. Because sometimes, it is more or less the opposite of what is being said in nice Davos-style groupings.”

Disagreeing with policy is fine, Canfin said. But what lobbyists often fail to do is make alternative policy proposals that have the same climate effect as the EU’s original plan.

“So, we have to counter this tsunami of lobbying and stay firm on our climate ambition. Because at the end of the day, beyond all the regulations that are on the table today, there is something much more important than that, which is our capacity to live on this planet,” Canfin said.

News in brief

Industry CEOs call for looser carbon market rules. Almost 300 CEOs from energy intensive industries – mainly steel, glass, paper, and chemicals – have signed a joint letter addressed to EU lawmakers ahead of a key vote in the European Parliament on the Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).

The signatories, representing 400 EU manufacturing companies, expressed their concern with the ETS and CBAM proposals which they say risk hurting their competitiveness on global markets.

Instead of the current proposal to phase out free allowances for industry, they are asking for “predictable measures and realistic timelines”.

“Step changes risk overburdening companies before they can implement the necessary investments and develop the markets for low carbon products. In this regard, the latest proposals on ETS and CBAM weaken carbon leakage provisions, further increase unilateral regulatory costs and harm the competitiveness of European industries in EU or international markets,” reads the letter. The full letter can be accessed here[https://www.eurofer.eu/publications/position-papers/industrys-climate-neutrality-transition-pathways-need-a-predictable-and-enabling-policy-framework-rather-than-abrupt-step-changes/].

Pressure mounts ahead of Parliament’s ‘Fit for 55’ vote. Ahead of the European Parliament’s key votes today on the Fit for 55 climate package, lawmakers have been attempting a final push to support their views.

On Tuesday (7 June), lawmakers debated new and reformed laws, proposed by the European Commission in July, including an overhaul of the carbon market, a new carbon border levy and a reform of land use and forestry legislation. Today, they will vote on their approach to these topics before entering into negotiations with EU countries to finalise the adoption of these laws.

Ahead of the vote, the European People’s Party lawmaker Peter Liese put out a statement about the importance of tackling climate change, saying that a “great deal”[https://www.peter-liese.de/images/Rede_Plenum_ETS-07062022.pdf] has been achieved in reforming the carbon market.

Meanwhile, the Greens have been very active, launching a tracker of the voting procedure and suggesting what amendments to follow[https://www.greens-efa.eu/opinions/fit-for-55/].

On land use and forestry, the rapporteur for the LULUCF regulation, Ville Niinistö, told EURACTIV: “The European Parliament has a historic opportunity to show leadership towards climate-smart and sustainable land use by supporting the environment committee’s progressive report on carbon sinks in the LULUCF regulation. By adopting this view, it promotes the increase of carbon farming in agriculture, more sustainable forest management and restoration of nature in the benefit of both biodiversity and carbon sequestration.”

Meanwhile, Henrike Hahn, the Green rapporteur for the economy committee’s opinion on the social climate fund said: “A green transformation of the economy must be socially just. The Social Climate Fund is now tackling energy and mobility poverty with structural and direct investments – exactly where people in Europe are hurt the most. This will also be necessary if the emissions trading system is extended to the building and transport sectors, as proposed by the European Commission.”

The European Commission is also weighing in. EU climate chief Frans Timmermans spoke to lawmakers in Strasbourg, saying: “I would urge you to vote for a consistent package to reach our climate targets and also I would urge you to make sure that in doing this, we leave no one behind. Our policy will be just or there just will not be a policy,” he said. (You can read his remarks on the emissions trading scheme and Fit for 55 here[https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/nl/SPEECH_22_3526] and on CO2 standards for cars and LULUCF here[https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_22_3534]).

The Fit for 55 package is made up of many complex and interlinking proposals. Lawmakers will have a day to vote in quick succession on their positions. Meanwhile, the need to reduce Europe’s reliance on Russian fossil fuels, high energy prices and climate change have put increased pressure on these files. (Kira Taylor | EURACTIV.com)

Czechs to prioritise ‘energy security’ at EU helm. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has demonstrated that the EU “is able to respond decisively” to new threats, according to a draft memo circulated by the Czech Republic ahead of its six-month EU Council presidency starting on 1 July.

Still, the Russia crisis has shown that Europe must “find the courage to rethink and reevaluate many of our current approaches” taking into account the EU’s diversity, the document adds.

The first priority of the Czech EU Presidency will be to manage the flow of refugees coming from Ukraine and preparing for the post-war recovery. On energy security – the second priority – this means breaking the EU’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels and swiftly adopting EU rules on gas storages ahead of next winter.

“The Czech Presidency will put emphasis on the EU’s energy security issues, which are currently more pressing than the energy transition,” the memo says. It adds, however, that this also means accelerating the implementation of the European Commission’s REPowerEU plan, “an important part of which is diversification of sources including logistics, energy savings and acceleration of the transition to low-emission and renewable energy sources.”

“However, the Czech Presidency will focus especially on thorough implementation of the main short-term objective, i.e. remove dependence on Russian fossil fuels,” it says, citing the crucial importance of developing “transmission infrastructure” for the EU’s energy resilience. More on the Czech Presidency priorities here[https://www.euractiv.com/section/eu-council-presidency/news/leak-the-five-political-priorities-of-the-upcoming-czech-presidency/].

7 EU countries decry lack of ambition on shipping decarbonisation. 7 EU member states have released a joint statement[https://www.permanentrepresentations.nl/documents/publications/2022/06/02/joint-statement-on-fueleu-maritime] criticising the French EU presidency for its lack of ambition in decarbonising shipping.

Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Luxemburg, the Netherlands and Sweden have highlighted their support for the objective of the FuelEU Maritime Initiative, while at the same time asking for a “more proactive legislative framework”.

As part of the ‘Fit for 55’ package of legislative proposals, the FuelEU Maritime Initiative seeks to decarbonise the EU maritime sector by limiting the carbon intensity of the energy used on board ships, setting up a fuel standard for ships and introducing a requirement for the most polluting ship types to use onshore electricity when at berth.

“The unambitious compromise delivered by the French presidency left many countries dismayed,” said Faig Abbasov, Shipping Director at Transport & Environment, a clean mobility NGO.

“The Council position shows that EU member states have failed to practise at home the shipping decarbonisation targets they preach internationally. Above all, it missed an opportunity to put around a quarter of a million tonnes of green hydrogen to be used in shipping every year by the end of this decade,” he added.

The joint statement asks for higher greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets within FuelEU Maritime, an increase in incentives towards the use of clean and renewable fuels in maritime transport, as well as higher ambitions for the EU Member States. (Valentina Romano | EURACTIV.com).

Revision of Energy Taxation Directive voted on in ITRE. A revision of the current EU taxation system for energy products and electricity was voted on 2 June[https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/249382/2022-06-02-roll-call-votes.pdf] by the European Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) with 55 votes to 9, and 11 abstentions.

The revision of the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD) was tabled last year by the European Commission. The proposal[https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_3662] introduces a new structure of tax rates based on the energy content and environmental performance of fuels and electricity, as well as broadening the taxable base through the inclusion of more products and the elimination of some of the current exemptions and reductions.

The proposed switch to a taxation base according to energy content is aimed at encouraging the use of electricity and alternative fuels, and discourage incentives for petrol and diesel[https://www.euractiv.com/section/biofuels/news/eu-energy-tax-plan-seeks-to-end-hidden-advantage-for-fossil-fuels/].

The adoption of the proposal in the EU Council of Ministers will be challenging because it requires unanimity among the 27 EU member states.

Petro Welt Technologies AG

FN 69011 m

Resolutions proposed by the Management Board and the

Supervisory Board

for the 17th Annual General Meeting on 29 June 2022

Agenda item 8:

Sale of the participations in Russia.

The Management Board and the Supervisory Board propose to the shareholders to postpone to another shareholders' meeting the resolution on the approval of the sale of the Company's participations in Russia.

Rationale

The Company currently considers selling its Russian business segment. The Management Board and the Supervisory Board believe that due to current EU and U.S. sanctions against Russia on the one hand and Russian counter-sanctions against the EU and the U.S.A. on the other hand the sale of the Russian subsidiaries is the only option available enabling the Company's Russian subsidiaries to continue their business activities.

1. Current situation

Petro Welt Technologies AG (the "Company") is primarily engaged in oil drilling, fracturing, sidetracking and related oil services for major Russian and Kazakhstan oil producing companies. During the last several years the Company started investigating the Romanian and Oman markets for similar services and entered into similar agreements and holds equipment for the provision of similar services in these countries.

In order to manage its Russian operations, the Company requires Russian managers having knowledge of the local market. Such people are usually Russian citizens or residents and are subject to Russian legislation.

The Company and its subsidiaries in Russia have close ties with the EU and the U.S.A.:

* Depending on the type of services, from 40% to 80% of the equipment used for oil services performed by the Company and its subsidiaries in Russia is imported from the EU and the U.S.A.

* 35% of all spare parts and consumables are imported from the EU.

* The Company's equipment requires regular technical servicing with the involvement of EU technical specialists.

In Russia, 70% of the Company's services are carried out on basis of contracts with Russian energy companies which are either directly or indirectly controlled by the Russian Federation or named in the EU sanctions lists.

EU Sanctions

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) No. 833/2014 (as amended, "General Sanctions Regulation"), and Council Regulation (EU) No. 269/2014 (as amended, the "Personal Sanctions Regulation") the EU introduced certain restrictions in respect of operations and transactions directly affecting the Company, its top managers and its Russian subsidiaries and their operations:

* A significant part of the clients of the Company's Russian subsidiaries are sanctioned persons. Thus, the Company and its Russian subsidiaries cannot continue rendering services to most of their clients. It is generally prohibited to directly or indirectly engage in any transaction with publicly controlled or publicly owned Russian entities listed in Annex XIX of the General Sanctions Regulation. The same prohibition applies to transactions with any legal person established outside the EU that is, directly or indirectly, owned for more than 50% by a listed entity and to any legal entity acting on behalf or at the direction of a listed publicly controlled or publicly owned Russian entity or of a non-EU legal person which is owned for more than 50% by a listed entity.

* Financing the Russian energy sector is prohibited. The Russian subsidiaries of the Company and their clients are companies "operating in the energy sector". Thus, the Company cannot grant loan or credits (or other similar financing or investments) to its Russian subsidiaries. EU Member States are prohibited from participating in providing financing, including loans or credit (also by equity capital) to, or creating new joint ventures with any entity or body incorporated or constituted under the laws of Russia, or any other third country and operating in the energy sector in Russia. EU Member States are also prohibited from providing investment services related to these activities. However, the competent authorities of the EU Member States may authorize specific investment activities under certain conditions. The European Commission qualifies the Russian subsidiaries of the Company and their customers as companies "operating in the energy sector" in the meaning of the General Sanctions Regulation. Thus, the above-mentioned prohibitions apply with respect to financing activities regarding the Company's Russian subsidiaries. It is uncertain whether Austria will approve any financing of the Company's Russian subsidiaries on an individual basis. From today's point of view the Company cannot grant new loans or credits (or other similar financing or investments) to its Russian subsidiaries.

* Providers of software and hardware like Microsoft, Siemens, VMWare, Cisco, TeamViewer, Hewlett Packard, Lenovo and others used by the Russian subsidiaries of the Company ceased supporting their software and refuse to extend licenses in the territory of Russia . This creates an additional significant risk for the operations of the Company's subsidiaries in Russia.

M.12979914.1

* The Company's investment program in respect of the purchase of new equipment for the operations of its Russian subsidiaries, its technical servicing, etc. cannot be performed any longer, which puts the operations performed by the Company's Russian subsidiaries at risk. Besides, normal operations of the Russian subsidiaries of the Company using their existing equipment become virtually impossible in the absence of technical support from the Company or EU contractors. Wide export related prohibitions are in place. It is prohibited to sell, supply, transfer or export, directly or indirectly, listed goods or technology, including certain types of oilfield equipment, whether or not originating in the European Union, to any individual or legal entity in Russia or for use in Russia. Furthermore, the financing or financial assistance and technical assistance related to such goods and technology to any individual or legal entity in Russia or for use in Russia is prohibited. Furthermore, the same export related prohibitions apply in respect of certain listed goods and technology suited for use in oil refining (e.g. chemicals used for oil refining) and such listed goods and technology that could contribute to the enhancement of Russian industrial capacities (e.g. numerous industrial goods, such as propane as produced by Wellprop, one of the Company's Russian subsidiaries).

* As a result of the asset freeze sanctions on Russian banks the Company will need to reconsider any financing arrangements or even maintenance of bank accounts of Russian subsidiaries in long-term used Russian banks to prevent the violation of EU sanctions by the Company (e.g. through approval of financing transactions of Russian subsidiaries with blocked banks or through remittance of funds on bank accounts of Russian subsidiaries in blocked banks). The Company may be unable to provide or may risk violating broad representations and warranties in its financing agreements with foreign banks, if the PeWeTe Group maintains relations with blocked Russian banks. Asset freezes and prohibitions from making funds and economic resources available to sanctions listed individuals and entities were imposed by the EU. Asset freeze sanctions were imposed on significant Russian banks, including VTB. The same sanctions may yet be extended to Sberbank due to the imposition of asset freeze sanctions on Mr. Herman Gref (President and Chairman of the Management Board of Sberbank). Financing agreements of the Company with foreign banks may contain strict representations and warranties that trigger violations in case the PeWeTe Group interacts with entities that are subject to EU asset freeze sanctions. Even if not relevant for current financing arrangements, going forward, foreign banks may request such representations and warranties in new financing agreements given the increased sanctions pressure on Russia.

* The EU sanctions regime, including potential liability for its violation and potential criminal liability, applies to the Company, its management and other persons having the right to direct the Company's decisions in respect of matters affected by EU sanctions. The EU sanctions apply in the territory of the EU, to any legal person or entity in respect of any business done within the EU, an d worldwide to any national of an EU Member State and to any legal entity which is incorporated or constituted under the laws of an EU Member State.

M.12979914.1

In addition to the general and direct applicability of the EU sanctions a legal transaction in breach of EU sanction measures is punishable under the Austrian Sanctions Act (Sanktionengesetz 2010) with administrative fines of up to EUR 50,000 or, in case the transaction relates to assets worth more than EUR 100,000, with criminal penalty (imprisonment of up to one year). Generally, both Austrian administrative penalty and criminal laws are applicable to all offences committed within Austria. In that regard, an offence will be deemed committed in Austria if (i) the offender has acted or should have acted in Austria or (ii) a result corresponding to the offence has occurred in whole or in part or should have occurred according to the offender's conception in Austria.

U.S. sanctions

Pursuant to Executive Orders 14024, 14066, 14071, Directive 2 to Executive Order 13662 and Directive 3 to Executive Order 14024 ("Executive Orders") and in the U.S. Export Administration Regulations ("EAR") the U.S. introduced certain restrictions in respect of operations and transactions directly affecting the Company, its top managers and its Russian subsidiaries and their operations:

* Due to the prohibitions on USD denominated transactions the Company will be unable to provide USD financing to its Russian subsidiaries operating in the energy sector in Russia or any other sector of the Russian economy. The Company will be significantly limited in its ability to receive payments in USD from and to make payments in USD to non-sanctioned Russian counterparties. Any non-U.S. person can be held liable for "causing" a U.S. person, including a U.S. financial institution processing US$ payments, to violate the Executive Orders. It is prohibited that such non-US person undertakes a new investment in the energy sector of Russia in USD cleared through or transferred with the involvement of a US correspondent bank. This includes in particular the commitment or contribution of funds or other assets for, or a loan or other extension of credit to, e.g. the exploration, extraction, drilling and mining of petroleum or other products capable of producing energy, such as coal or wood or agricultural products used to manufacture biofuels, in Russia. Furthermore, any USD denominated transactions involving Russian banks under the U.S. blocking sanctions, which includes such major banks as Sberbank, VTB and Alfa-Bank, may violate U.S. sanctions. Apart from violation risks such transactions will be practically impossible, as U.S. correspondent banks will block any USD transfers. Violations of these prohibitions may be subject to both criminal and administrative penalties. Criminal penalties can include up to 20 years of imprisonment and up to USD 1 million in fines per violation, or both. Administrative penalties can reach up to USD 330,947 per violation or twice the value of the transaction, whichever is greater.

* The Company and its Russian subsidiaries may need to cancel financing products from Russian banks that are subject to blocking sanctions (such as Sberbank) and may need to reconsider other dealings with them. The U.S. may block all property and interests in property, which is in the U.S. or within the possession of any U.S. person, of a non-U.S. person which "materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support

M.12979914.1

of" certain activities or certain sanctioned persons and such property and interests in property may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn or otherwise dealt in.

Significant Russian banks, such as Sberbank, VTB and Alfa-Bank have been designated for the blocking sanctions list under Executive Order 14024.

Financing and other transactions with Russian banks that are subject to the U.S. blocking sanctions may, depending on their scope, volume and conditions, trigger sanctions risks for non-U.S. participants that are not blocked.

Financing agreements of the Company with foreign banks may contain strict representations and warranties that trigger violations in case the PeWeTe Group interacts with entities that are subject to U.S. blocking sanctions. Albeit not relevant for current financing arrangements, going forward foreign banks may request such representations and warranties in new financing agreements, given the increased sanctions pressure on Russia.

* The Company's investment program in respect of the purchase of new U.S. origin equipment for operations of its Russian subsidiaries cannot be performed any longer, which puts the Russian companies' operations at risk. The Russia Export Controls Rule under the EAR requires a license for export, re-export or transfer to or within Russia of all "items subject to the EAR" that are listed on the Commerce Control List ("CCL")) and sets forth a policy of denial for the required licenses. The requirements and restrictions of the EAR apply to "items subject to the EAR", which includes (i) all items in the U.S.A., (ii) all U.S.-origin items, wherever located, (iii) foreign-made software that is commingled with controlled U.S.-origin software, and foreign-made technology that is commingled with controlled U.S.-origin technology, and (iv) certain "foreign direct products" (where a non-U.S. item is the "direct product" of U.S.-controlled software or technology or plants that use certain U.S. software or technology). The CCL list includes oil exploration equipment and other items that may be relevant for oil extraction projects. Violations of the EAR may be subject to both criminal and administrative penalties. Criminal penalties can include up to 20 years of imprisonment and up to USD 1 million in fines per violation, or both. Administrative penalties can reach up to USD 328,121 per violation or twice the value of the transaction, whichever is greater. Violating the regulations can also result in a temporary denial order with respect to the violator or inclusion of the violator on the Entities List which in both cases leads to the prohibition for any third party to carry out export operations subject to EAR with such person temporarily (e.g., for 180 days) or until delisting from the Entity List (the scope of EAR restrictions may vary).

Russian counter-sanctions

Russia introduced certain stringent counter-sanctions in respect of operations and transactions directly affecting the Company, its top managers, its Russian subsidiaries and their top managers:

* According to the Russian government Order No. 430-p of March 5, 2022 Austria was included in the list of hostile states. Legal entities registered as a hostile state such as the Company are subject to various restrictions and prohibitions set forth in Russian legislation.

Warsaw - Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg (Conservative People's Party, VP) has met his Polish counterpart Zbigniew Rau in Warsaw on Tuesday. It was the first visit of an Austrian Foreign Minister to Poland for many years. Schallenberg and Rau assured each other of mutual esteem, including with regard to aid to Ukraine. Schallenberg praised Poland's role in the Ukraine conflict: "Warsaw is the fulcrum of Western aid."

Poland's stance on Ukraine was clear, the territorial integrity of Ukraine must be preserved, Rau stated. Those who commit genocide must be held accountable, he said. Kyiv had every right to receive military and humanitarian aid in the face of Russia's attack.

The sixth sanction package was an important step to change the EU independence of Russian resources, Rau said. "This was however not enough", he stated. There should be a full import stop of oil and gas products from Russia to the EU. Rau also demanded the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian banks from the international payment traffic.

Among friends one could however also address the issue of rule of law, Schallenberg stated. He welcomed steps through which the EU Recovery Fund could be opened. If the Ukraine war has taught us one thing, it is that we must show our colours when it comes to our fundamental values, the Austrian Foreign Minister said. It was crucial that the EU acts united.

In acquiring land for the memorial site of the former concentration camp Gusen in Upper Austria Rau hoped for Austria to do more. "Our countries share a long diverse and changing history, including very dark chapters", Schallenberg said. Therefore, he said, he was glad that Austria was living up to its responsibility by purchasing land belonging to the former subcamp of the Mauthausen concentration camp in Gusen. "Tens of thousands of Poles were disenfranchised, dehumanized and murdered there," Schallenberg said, adding that there was a need for a dignified memorial site. Rau expressed gratitude for the Republic's activities to date regarding Gusen: "We expect that there will be more to come."

The Foreign Minister also met displaced Ukrainians. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR ) more than 6.5 million people have fled the country since the Russian attack on Ukraine. With 3.5 million refugees Poland took in the majority of Ukrainian refugees.

Later Schallenberg met Matteo Mecacci, head of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) in Warsaw.

Austrian Ministry of Justice Wants Better European Cooperation in the Area of Justice

(Vindobona) Justice and Home Affairs Ministers are discussing stricter environmental criminal law, better international cooperation on criminal offenses and Russia sanctions in the European Council. The Austrian Ministry of Justice under Alma Zadic welcomes stricter prosecution of environmental crimes and a united effort to sanction Russian oligarchs.

The Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers of the European Union are discussing environmental criminal law, better international cooperation on environmental crimes and standardization of prosecuting the assets of Russian oligarchs. Austria calls for better European cooperation in these fields of law.

Austria welcomes better cooperation in the European Union to sanction Russian oligarchs.

The Austrian government, more precisely the Ministry of Justice, welcomes a stricter environmental law on an international, especially European level.

Sanctions against Russian oligarchs

Justice Minister Alma Zadic has described the EU Commission's proposal for a simplified confiscation of Russian oligarchs' assets as a reasonable step.

According to the ORF[https://orf.at/stories/3270276/], Zadic expressed her concerns, that due to the inconsistent regulations across Europe, there may well be gaps in the prosecution against Russian oligarchs. Therefore, Zadic demanded, that there is a need for standardization in terms of penalties and offenses.

The EU Commission has proposed making evading sanctions a criminal offense across the EU. According to Zadic, Russian billionaires close to the Kremlin have so far circumvented sanctions by, for example, bringing yachts into international waters or transferring assets to other owners.

According to the ORF[https://orf.at/stories/3270276/], the EU justice ministers are discussing the issue, but there is said to be no agreement yet. They "will have to turn a lot of screws," Zadic said. At the same time, she expressed her conviction "that there will also be some convergence on this issue."

Austria wants better Prosecution of Environmental Criminal law

Austrian Justice Minister Alma Zadic expressed her concerns ahead of the Justice Ministers' meeting, "We need new criminal offenses to make crimes against our environment more punishable. This is what I will be advocating today at the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Luxembourg."

According to the Austrian ministry of justice, Austria has fully implemented the last EU directive on environmental criminal law and supports the Commission's current plan to introduce stricter environmental criminal law.

Alma Zadic commended this positive development in Austrian efforts to protect the environment and stated that more needs to be done. Justice Minister Zadic said, "The relatively low number of indictments and convictions for environmental crimes are a sign that improvements are needed in this area. Environmental offenders should be able to be held accountable for their actions throughout Europe. That is why I support a European solution and am pleased that the French Presidency wants to do something about this."

According to the Austrian Ministry of Justice, Zadic is lobbying at the EU Council level to ensure that the new Environmental Criminal Law Directive also places greater responsibility on companies.

Justice Minister Zadic emphasized "the reckless treatment of the environment by companies in Austria and Europe". Further, the minister stated that "the fight against environmental sinners and polluters must be a priority. They must take responsibility - deterrent penalties are also needed for companies throughout the EU."

Zadic for stronger cooperation in Europe

Justice Minister Zadic advocates greater cooperation in Europe in the field of justice and therefore called for cooperation for common European solutions to global challenges.

In addition to environmental criminal law, the meeting focused on strengthening cooperation between EU countries in criminal matters in general.

"Especially in these challenging times, I welcome the EU's ambitions to continue strengthening international cooperation in criminal matters - whether it is cross-border cooperation in the face of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine or the fight against environmental crime and hate crimes, a European solution is needed. Austria will make its contribution here," concluded the Justice Minister.

Office of the Spokesperson

Canada, Mexico, and the United States share a close relationship based on shared values and priorities. We acknowledge that working together as North America we can bring new ideas and energy to the hemisphere, and we commit to reinvigorating how we address together the issues of our time. As three likeminded countries, we affirm our strong commitment to democratic principles and intend to cooperate closely to stand up for multilateralism and the rules-based international order, support the rule of law, promote inclusive growth, invest in the development of communities, protect and promote human rights, advance gender equality, and reinforce democracy at home and inspire democratic development around the world. We worked together towards ending the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to create the conditions for equitable growth and strengthening North American competitiveness. On the occasion of today’s North American Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Los Angeles, our three countries commit to further enhancing our deep partnership and to continue working together in support of peace and prosperity around the globe.

We reaffirm our support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and condemn Russia’s unprovoked invasion of its sovereign and democratic neighbor in violation of international law. Canada, Mexico, and the United States have repeatedly condemned civilian deaths resulting from Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and stated the importance of upholding international law, including the UN Charter. We also emphasize the urgent need to allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need. These are principles that sustain our rules-based order. We affirm the need to ensure accountability in relevant national and international courts for crimes committed, without exceptions, and support the work of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine established by the Human Rights Council. We are united in our continued support for the people of Ukraine. We also express our commitment to work together in support of those suffering around the world from the global impacts of this invasion, particularly vulnerable populations now experiencing greater food and economic insecurity.

Our coordinated responses to Russian aggression against Ukraine, including calls to establish a diplomatic path forward, demonstrate the importance of North American solidarity. We call on the Russian Federation to withdraw immediately all its military forces and equipment from within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine and return to a path of dialogue and diplomacy. Canada,

Mexico, and the United States – as close hemispheric partners and friends – are committed to further strengthening our relations, which is key to our collective security and prosperity.

We reaffirm our commitment to addressing the root causes of irregular migration and poverty and to investing in the region – prioritizing cooperation for development to create economic opportunity for all. In particular, the three governments are united in efforts towards investing in initiatives that directly benefit the most marginalized communities. We support multilateral efforts to develop value chains and physical infrastructure in the Americas that will generate employment and equitable growth. We acknowledge that addressing irregular migration in the region requires a coordinated approach, and we support the Regional Conference on Migration, the Comprehensive Regional Protection and Solutions Framework and the vision of the Global Compact on Migration.

We celebrate the tradition of our region in welcoming refugees and migrants, and we recognize the positive contributions of refugees and migrants to the socio-economic development of their host communities. We applaud the sustained efforts of States in our hemisphere in ensuring safe, orderly, and regular migration by hosting refugees, providing regular migration pathways, promoting local economic and social integration, facilitating voluntary return, and supporting the reintegration of returnees. We remain committed to collectively leveraging the benefits of migration while addressing its challenges in countries and communities of origin, transit, destination, and return.

We are committed to continuing our cooperation to support and strengthen Haiti’s democratic process, including through our collective efforts to promote an inclusive, Haitian-led political path forward. We are also committed to working closely with the United Nations and other regional partners to promote peaceful, fair, and sustainable growth throughout the hemisphere.

We reaffirm our commitment to protect human rights, particularly for members of vulnerable and historically marginalized communities, like the LGBTQI+ and two spirit community, and afro-descendant communities, as well as the rights of Indigenous peoples. We also stress the importance of individual freedom of expression and media freedom, and together advocate for addressing impunity and inequality.

We collectively commit to taking bold, swift, and coordinated action to address the climate crisis. Climate change threatens our economies and our communities, especially those who are vulnerable and underserved. As we work to address the climate crisis, we recognize the tremendous opportunity to build back better, to create well-paying and reliable jobs in ever-growing markets, and to position North America as a global leader in clean energy solutions.

As partner countries in championing development in the Americas, we reaffirm our commitment to advancing feminist approaches, eliminating structural and indirect barriers for women, girls and marginalized people, and to integrate gender perspectives in our shared priorities. We continue to advocate for feminist approaches for a more effective, fair, relevant and accountable United Nations in support of the Sustainable Development Goals.

We recognize the integral place of Indigenous peoples in North America, and their contributions to the diversity and richness of our culture and society. We acknowledge that cultural diversity and linguistic plurality are part of the heritage of humanity, so we place great value in the historical and cultural legacy of indigenous communities in the region.

By recognizing the historical legacy towards indigenous communities, our vision aims to achieve real progress towards reconciliation and a renewed relationship based on respect, truth, cooperation, partnership, and in recognition of the rights of Indigenous peoples. We reiterate our unwavering commitment to ensure that Indigenous rights, interests, and aspirations are recognized in decision-making. We intend to work together, in partnership with Indigenous peoples from our three countries, to attain our goals of safety, security, well-being, socio-economic development, and empowerment for all Indigenous peoples. We also recognize that ending violence against Indigenous women and girls requires a holistic, multidimensional, and multi-sectoral approach.

During our meeting today, we also discussed planning for the next North American Leaders’ Summit in Mexico in December.

We look forward to our increased cooperation in the years to come.

Alleged collective boycott: České dráhy and ÖBB under EU scrutiny[https://portal.ieu-monitoring.com/editorial/alleged-collective-boycott-ceske-drahy-and-obb-under-eu-scrutiny/379669/?utm_source=ieu-portal]

The European Commission sends its Statement of Objections to České dráhy and Österreichische Bundesbahnen over alleged collective boycott

Brussels, 10 June 2022

The European Commission has informed České dráhy (‘ČD’) and Österreichische Bundesbahnen (‘ÖBB’), the Czech and Austrian rail incumbents, of its preliminary view that they have breached EU antitrust rules by colluding in the market for used passenger railway wagons with the aim to distort competition in the rail passenger transport market.

Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said:

“With healthy competition, European citizens benefit from good quality and affordable rail passenger services. Attractive rail passenger services also encourage travellers to shift from road to rail transport, which is essential for achieving the EU Green Deal’s objectives. In today’s Statement of Objections, we preliminarily found that ÖBB and ČD breached EU competition rules by colluding to hinder access to used wagons to a new entrant, RegioJet, restricting competition on the rail passenger transport market.”

Statement of Objections on the companies’ alleged collective boycott

In 2011, the Czech rail company RegioJet entered the long-distance rail passenger transport market in Czechia. For its operations, RegioJet largely relied on used wagons to be able to compete with ČD and ÖBB.

The Commission preliminarily finds that, between 2012 and 2016, ČD and ÖBB engaged in a collective boycott aimed at maintaining their market position and impeding the expansion of RegioJet both in Czechia and on the international rail route between Prague and Vienna. A collective boycott occurs when a group of competitors agree to exclude or hinder an actual or potential competitor.

In particular, the Commission’s preliminary view is that ČD and ÖBB agreed to hinder RegioJet’s access to ÖBB’s used wagons for long-distance passenger transport. To ensure that RegioJet could not acquire those wagons, ČD and ÖBB coordinated their actions in order to boycott RegioJet in sales of used ÖBB wagons.

If the Commission’s preliminary view were confirmed, ČD’s and ÖBB’s conduct would infringe Article 101[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:12008E101] of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU’) that prohibits anti-competitive business practices such as collusion.

Sending a Statement of Objections does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation.

Background

The Commission’s investigation started with unannounced inspections in June 2016[https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_16_2438].

A Statement of Objections is a formal step in the Commission’s investigations into suspected violations of EU antitrust rules. The Commission informs the parties concerned in writing of the objections raised against them. The parties can then examine the documents in the Commission’s investigation file, reply in writing and request an oral hearing to present their comments on the case before representatives of the Commission and national competition authorities.

If, after the parties have exercised their rights of defence, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence of an infringement, it can adopt a decision prohibiting the conduct and imposing a fine of up to 10% of a company’s annual worldwide turnover.

There is no legal deadline for the Commission to complete antitrust inquiries into anticompetitive conduct. The duration of an antitrust investigation depends on a number of factors, including the complexity of the case, the extent to which the undertaking concerned cooperates with the Commission and the exercise of the rights of defence.

To deliver on the objectives of the EU Green Deal[https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en], emphasis is placed on increasing the efficiency of the transport system, strongly prioritising the rail transport as an environmental-friendly mode of transport. This cannot be achieved without the existence of effective competition.

Algeria: EU and EEAS statement on Algeria’s latest measures against Spain[https://portal.ieu-monitoring.com/editorial/algeria-eu-and-eeas-statement-on-algerias-latest-measures-against-spain/379666/?utm_source=ieu-portal]

Brussels, 10 June 2022

The decision taken by Algeria to suspend the Treaty of friendship and good neighbourly relations signed with Spain in 2002 is of utmost concern. We are assessing the implications of the Algerian actions, including the instruction given to the financial institutions to stop transactions between the two countries, which upfront appear to be in violation of the EU-Algeria Association Agreement, in particular in the area of trade and investment. This would lead to a discriminatory treatment of an EU Member State and adversely affect the exercise of the Union’s rights under the Agreement.

We are in close contact with the Spanish Government and reaching out to the Algerian authorities to rapidly clarify the situation.

Bilateral relations of third countries with individual EU Member States are part of their relations with the EU. Unity and solidarity within the EU remain key to uphold our interests and values in our relations with all countries. Moreover, trade policy is an exclusive EU competence, and the EU is ready to stand up against any type of coercive measures applied against an EU Member State. However, the EU continues to favour dialogue first to solve controversies.

Algeria is an important partner for the EU in the Mediterranean and a key actor for regional stability. We trust that, in the name of our strong and long-term partnership, a swift solution will be found to fully re-establish commercial and investment relations.

We are ready and keen to support these efforts.

Eurobarometer reports broad euro support in non-euro EU Member States[https://portal.ieu-monitoring.com/editorial/eurobarometer-reports-broad-euro-support-in-non-euro-eu-member-states/379660/?utm_source=ieu-portal]

Brussels, 10 June 2022

Today the Commission published its annual Flash Eurobarometer on the introduction of the euro in the Member States which have not yet adopted the common currency. The study was carried out between April 20 and 29, 2022 in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Sweden.

The new survey shows broad support for the euro: on average, 60% of respondents said they were in favor of the introduction of the single currency. The most favorable opinions on adoption come from Romania (77% in favor) and Hungary (69%), while the least favorable are those from Bulgaria and the Czech Republic (44% in both cases) and Sweden (45%).

More than half of respondents believe that the introduction of the common currency would have positive consequences for their country (55%). However, 56% of people who took part in the survey also think that the introduction of the euro will cause prices to rise.

Furthermore, the results of the survey show that the citizens of the Member States which do not yet belong to the euro zone are more aware of this subject than before: 53% of those questioned consider themselves informed about the euro, against 51% last year and 44% in 2015. The full Flash Eurobarometer is available here.

Tax relief within agriculture and forestry – EU Commission answer[https://portal.ieu-monitoring.com/editorial/tax-relief-within-agriculture-and-forestry-eu-commission-answer/379609/?utm_source=ieu-portal]

See question(s) : P-001365/2022[https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-9-2022-001365_EN.html]

Brussels, 9 June 2022

Article 15(3) of the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD) which is currently in force provides for that Member States may apply at national level a level of taxation down to zero for energy products and electricity used, among others, in agriculture, horticulture and pisciculture works, and in forestry.

According to Article 6 of the current ETD Directive, Member States shall be free to give effect to exemptions or reductions in the level of taxation not only directly or through a differentiated rate but also by means of refunding all or part of the amount of taxation. To the extent tax reductions and exemptions constitute State aid, they must be in line with State aid rules.

Under the CAP strategic plans there is no possibility to subsidise the price of fuel for agricultural and forestry holdings.

Police cooperation and information exchange: EU Council adopts next steps[https://portal.ieu-monitoring.com/editorial/police-cooperation-and-information-exchange-eu-council-adopts-next-steps/379654/?utm_source=ieu-portal]

Luxembourg, 10 June 2022

To effectively fight crime and respond to new criminal threats, the Council adopted a recommendation on operational police cooperation. It also adopted the general approaches on an information exchange directive and the Prüm II regulation.

Prüm II regulation

The objective of the Prüm regulation is to facilitate the automatic exchange between law enforcement authorities of DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration data in order to prevent, detect and investigate criminal offences. It allows the law enforcement authorities to consult the national databases of one or several member states, and provides them with a ‘hit’ or ‘no hit’ reply. They can then request the relevant data.

The new text extends this exchange to other data categories, such as facial images, the police records of suspects and convicted criminals, and driving licences.

The new text also aims to modernise the technical infrastructure supporting these exchanges by replacing the multitude of direct connections between national databases with a central router connecting them all. This will make the system more powerful and efficient, allowing authorities to consult multiple databases more easily.

The text also integrates Europol into the Prüm system by allowing the agency to launch queries and to provide access to its databases containing non-EU biometric data.

Information exchange directive

This text will regulate the organisational and procedural aspects of information exchange between law enforcement authorities, contributing to an efficient exchange of information. It will ensure equivalent access for law enforcement authorities to information available in other member states and avoid the proliferation of communication channels used for information exchange, while reinforcing the role of Europol as the EU’s criminal information hub.

Member states will have a single point of contact (SPOC), operational 24/7, for information exchanges with other EU countries. For urgent cases, the information requested should be made available within eight hours if it is directly available to the SPOC and within three days if the SPOC can obtain it from public authorities or private parties. For all other requests, the information should be made available within seven days.

In addition, Europol should be copied in on all information exchanges, with only certain exceptions listed in the text. The Secure Information Exchange Network Application (SIENA), managed by Europol, would become the default channel of communication.

Recommendation on operational police cooperation

Cross-border hot pursuits and surveillance, as well as patrols and joint operations, are key instruments of police cooperation, helping to ensure that people cannot escape law enforcement simply by crossing the border.

The recommendation adopted sets out a series of standards for operational cooperation between police officers operating in another member state or participating in joint operations. Recommendations include:

* a series of principles for cross-border hot pursuits and surveillance

* a list of offences for which cross-border hot pursuit and surveillance should be allowed

* a framework for joint operations

* the introduction of a support platform for joint patrols and other joint operations, as well as ensuring effective access to information and communication through secure channels

* joint training and professional development with a view to setting up a European police culture

Next steps

Negotiations with the European Parliament on the two legislative proposals will start once the latter has adopted its position.

Background

steady-paywall

Terrorist groups and organised crime organisations engage in a wide range of criminal activities, which spread across borders. According to Europol’s 2021 serious and organised crime threat assessment, almost 70% of criminal networks are active in more than three member states.

Therefore, police officers need to be able to cooperate systematically across the EU and have access to information available to their colleagues in other member states if they are to effectively fight crime and respond to new criminal threats.

A number of measures have been taken in recent years, including the implementation of interoperability between EU justice and home affairs databases and the strengthening of Europol’s mandate. However, more can still be done. On 9 December 2021, the European Commission presented these proposals as part of a package to improve police cooperation.

Schengen borders code reform: EU Council adopts its general approach[https://portal.ieu-monitoring.com/editorial/schengen-borders-code-reform-eu-council-adopts-its-general-approach/379645/?utm_source=ieu-portal]

Luxembourg, 10 June 2022

As part of the work carried out under the French presidency to reform and strengthen the Schengen area in the face of new challenges, the Council today adopted its general approach on the reform of the Schengen borders code.

This reform: (i) provides new tools to combat the instrumentalisation of migrant flows; (ii) establishes a new legal framework for external border measures in the event of a health crisis, drawing on the lessons learned from the experience with COVID-19; (iii) updates the legal framework for reintroducing internal border controls in order to safeguard the principle of free movement while responding to persistent threats; (iv) introduces alternative measures to these controls.

The general approach now enables the Council to start negotiations with the European Parliament, once the Parliament has adopted its own position.

The fight against the instrumentalisation of migration flows

The text defines the instrumentalisation of migrants as a situation in which a third country or non-state actor encourages or facilitates the movement of third-country nationals towards the EU’s external borders or to a member state in order to destabilise the EU or a member state. It introduces new measures to combat this phenomenon, including limiting the number of crossing points at the external border or limiting their opening hours, and intensifying border surveillance.

External border measures in the event of a health crisis

The text provides for the possible swift adoption of binding minimum rules on temporary travel restrictions at the external borders in the event of a threat to public health. This will strengthen the currently available tools applied during the COVID-19 pandemic, which have been based on non-binding recommendations.

The binding implementing regulation to be adopted by the Council in such situations will include minimum restrictions, with the possibility for member states to apply stricter restrictions if the conditions so require. It will also include a list of essential travellers to be exempted from certain measures, which will be decided on a case by case basis.

Reintroduction of internal border controls

The text sets out more structured procedures for the reintroduction of internal border controls, with stronger safeguards. It takes into account a recent judgment by the European Court of Justice, which confirmed the principle of freedom of movement within the Schengen area, while specifying the conditions for the reintroduction of internal border controls. In this regard, it offers possible responses to persistent threats to public policy and internal security.

If a continued need for internal border controls is confirmed beyond two years and six months, the member state concerned will need to notify the Commission of its intention to further prolong internal border controls, providing justification for doing so and specifying the date on which it expects to lift controls. The Commission will then issue a recommendation, also relating to that date, and with regard to the principles of necessity and proportionality, to be taken into account by the member state.

Promotion of alternative measures

The text updates the Schengen borders code by providing for alternative measures to internal border controls, in particular by proposing a more effective framework for police checks in member states’ border regions.

The text introduces a new procedure to address unauthorised movements of irregular migrants within the EU. In the context of a bilateral cooperation framework based on voluntary action by the member states concerned, this mechanism will allow a member state to transfer third-country nationals apprehended in the border area and illegally staying in its territory to the member state from which they arrived, in the context of operational cross-border police cooperation.

Home affairs (10 June 2022)

Asylum and migration

The Council very broadly supported the first step of the gradual approach to migration and asylum proposed by the presidency, including the screening regulation, the Eurodac regulation and the solidarity mechanism.

In the coming days, the presidency and the Commission will hold a meeting of the solidarity platform to operationalise the declaration on solidarity. The presidency will also formalise the adoption of the negotiating mandates for the screening and Eurodac regulations.

Schengen borders code: adoption of the general approach

As part of the presidency’s move to strengthen and reform Schengen, the Council today adopted its general approach on the reform of the Schengen borders code. This reform: (i) provides new tools to combat the instrumentalisation of migration flows; (ii) establishes a new legal framework for external border measures in the event of a health crisis, drawing lessons from the COVID-19 experience; (iii) modernises the legal framework for reintroducing internal border controls, to ensure the principle of free movement while addressing persistent threats; and (iv) introduces alternative measures to such controls.

Ministers also discussed the situation of the Schengen area. They responded to the main challenges and conclusions of the Schengen evaluations presented in the Commission’s report on the state of Schengen and discussed the lines of action proposed by the presidency for the coming months. These lines of action aim to strengthen the functioning of the Schengen area and cover several aspects, including the political governance of the Schengen area, external and internal borders, police cooperation, JHA information systems and visa and return policies.

Ministers also adopted without discussion a Council regulation reforming the Schengen evaluation and monitoring mechanism. The regulation is intended to help make the Schengen area more adaptable to current and future challenges. It introduces a more strategic focus for the mechanism, simplified and accelerated evaluation and monitoring procedures, closer cooperation with all relevant stakeholders and a stronger strategic role for the Council.

Over lunch, ministers held a political discussion on the activity of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex). They discussed the deployment of the standing corps, the governance of the agency, their expectations as regards the implementation of its mandate and the prospects for developing Frontex’s cooperation with third countries.

Response to the situation in Ukraine

Ministers took stock of the implementation of the 10-point plan for stronger European coordination on welcoming people fleeing the war from Ukraine. They stressed the need to continue work on the full implementation of the plan, including support for the reception and integration of people fleeing the war and assistance to Moldova. They also examined whether further action might need to be taken in the medium and long term, in particular with regard to contingency plans and possible additional financial needs.

Ministers also discussed measures to prevent and combat the possible trafficking in human beings and firearms and stressed the importance of remaining very vigilant on the evolution of criminal threats.

The Council adopted general approaches for a directive on information exchange between law enforcement authorities and the regulation on automated data exchange for police cooperation (Prüm II).

In addition, in order to effectively combat crime and respond to new criminal threats, the Council adopted a recommendation on operational police cooperation.

Ministers were briefed on the cooperation between competent authorities dealing with counter-terrorism, in the presence of the counter-terrorism group (CTG).

The presidency informed ministers of work done on non-legislative activities, in particular the implementation of the EU drugs strategy and action plan (2021-2025) and the fight against radicalisation.

It also informed ministers about the latest developments in work on current legislative proposals.

The presidency also reported on the preparations and agenda for the next EU-US ministerial meeting in the area of justice and home affairs.

The upcoming Czech presidency of the Council presented its work programme and priorities for the next six months.

Justice (9 June 2022)

Judicial responses to the situation in Ukraine

The Council exchanged views on the appropriate judicial responses in the context of the war in Ukraine.

Ministers confirmed the need to continue the coordination begun by the French presidency to support investigation and prosecution in relation to international crimes. Ministers reiterated their commitment to ensuring that, to the fullest extent possible, this war does not cause even greater suffering for displaced minors. Further to the démarches by Ukraine, they confirmed the importance of a political response at EU level.

Ministers also discussed the Commission’s recent proposal to extend the list of ‘EU crimes’ to violations of EU restrictive measures, given the exceptional situation and the need to ensure the effectiveness of EU sanctions. They responded very positively to the proposal, and discussions at technical level will resume quickly in order to meet the European Council’s call for speed.

Rights of the child

The Council adopted conclusions on the EU strategy on the rights of the child. The conclusions have a particular focus on the protection of children’s rights in crisis or emergency situations, in light of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.

More generally, the member states are called on to develop policies to enforce the rights of all children without discrimination, to increase efforts to prevent and combat all forms of violence against children, to strengthen their justice systems so that they respect the rights of all children and to increase opportunities for children to be responsible and resilient members of the digital society. A network of national contact points will make it possible to provide a more effective response to abduction alerts.

Environmental crime

The Council agreed on a partial general approach on the draft environmental crime directive. The partial general approach covers the articles and recitals defining criminal offences. Instead of the nine offences that currently exist under EU criminal law, ministers agreed on the definition of 20 offences, thus broadening and clarifying the scope of conduct that is prohibited because it harms the environment. This includes timber trafficking, a major cause of deforestation in some parts of the world, the illegal recycling of polluting boats and serious breaches of legislation on chemicals.

Ministers also discussed the harmonisation of sanction levels in order to provide guidance for further work.

Digitalisation of judicial cooperation in criminal matters

To step up the effectiveness of the tools for judicial cooperation in criminal matters and, as a result, the fight against cross-border crime, the Council approved Council general approaches on a proposal regarding digital information exchange in terrorism cases and on a proposal to establish a collaboration platform for joint investigation teams.

These proposals are part of ongoing efforts to modernise and digitalise cross-border judicial cooperation, making it easier for prosecutors and judges to exchange information and bring to justice a growing number of criminals and terrorists acting across borders.

International transfers of personal data

Over lunch ministers exchanged views on data protection in the context of international transfers of personal data. The Commission presented the state of play of discussions with the US regarding the regulatory reforms needed to adopt a new adequacy decision for the transfer of personal data, following the invalidation of the two previous decisions by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ministers stressed the importance of adopting a robust framework that respects the existing rulings of the Court of Justice and provides businesses with the legal certainty they need.

Ministers also discussed more generally the issue of transfers of personal data and the need for a coherent and ambitious European policy on this issue, given that such transfers have become a major strategic challenge in several important areas of public policy.

Ministers took stock of the ongoing negotiations between the Council and the European Parliament regarding the e-evidence proposals. The two institutions are now engaged in in-depth work to confirm a number of points of convergence and to prepare for political discussions on the central points of the text, which are scheduled for 14 June.

During the current presidency, the Council of Europe ad hoc group met for the 13th time. In parallel to this work, experts also focused on the preparation of the internal EU rules that will be needed.

The Commission presented its guidelines on extradition, published on 8 June 2022. This initiative notably follows concerns raised by some member states regarding the instrumentalisation of certain criminal prosecutions launched by third countries against EU citizens, including requests to member states for arrest and extradition.

NATO DSG previews next Strategic Concept at Copenhagen Democracy Summit[https://portal.ieu-monitoring.com/editorial/security/nato-dsg-previews-next-strategic-concept-at-copenhagen-democracy-summit/379601/?utm_source=ieu-portal]

10 Juni 2022

Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoană addressed Russia’s war on Ukraine and the future of NATO at the Copenhagen Democracy Summit on Friday (10 June 2022). Previewing the Alliance’s next Strategic Concept, which will be agreed at the Madrid Summit later in June, he said that the Concept will be a blueprint for NATO’s future adaptation.

Mr Geoană explained that the new Concept will reflect an era of great power competition, and recognise that Russia has become “one of the most important challenges to our security in Europe and also beyond”. He added that China’s role as a transformative player in world affairs will also be acknowledged. The next Strategic Concept will further highlight the importance of resilience and new technologies for Euro-Atlantic security.

Speaking about deterrence and defence, the Deputy Secretary General noted that NATO anticipates “a new generation of our presence in the East”. At the Madrid Summit, leaders will adapt the Alliance’s posture on the eastern flank for the longer term to reflect the new security reality. Mr Geoană said this is likely to include measures for faster and more effective reinforcement.

The Copenhagen Democracy Summit is an annual conference bringing together political and business leaders, including current and former heads of government, from the world’s democracies. It is led by Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Founder and Chairman of The Alliance of Democracies Foundation. Mr Rasmussen served as Secretary General of NATO from 2009 to 2014.

Mayor Paweł Adamowicz Award: nominations open[https://portal.ieu-monitoring.com/editorial/mayor-pawel-adamowicz-award-nominations-open/379594/?utm_source=ieu-portal]

Brussels, 9 June

​​Prize in honour of advocates of freedom, solidarity and tolerance offered by the City of Gdańsk, the European Committee of the Regions and the International Cities of Refuge Network.

​The Mayor of Gdańsk, Aleksandra Dulkiewicz[https://cor.europa.eu/EN/members/Pages/memberprofile.aspx?MemberId=2037047], announced the opening of nominations for the 2022 Mayor Paweł Adamowicz Award for local champions of freedom and solidarity and the fight against intolerance, oppression and xenophobia. She was speaking at the oday, at the general assembly of International Cities of Refuge Network.

The award is to city leaders, civic leaders, or organisations working in partnership with local and regional authorities, who build bridges and tear down walls, with a clear sense of responsibility for future generations and who does not shy from any urgent battle for human rights and civil liberties, locally, nationally or internationally.

The award honours the life and example of Paweł Adamowicz, Mayor of Gdańsk from 1998 until his murder on 13 January 2019. His murder was preceded by an upsurge of hate speech directed against him. The establishment of this Award is also recognition of everyone who works with courage and integrity against intolerance, radicalisation, hate speech, oppression and xenophobia, and who works to promote equal opportunities, social integration and fundamental rights.

Mr Adamowicz was committed to promoting the fundamental values of the EU, and he was an active member of the European Committee of the Regions. In 2016, Mayor Adamowicz launched the Gdańsk ‘Immigrant Integration Model’ after meeting Pope Francis. It has served as a model that inspired other Polish cities.

Speaking at the ICORN general assembly, the First Vice-President of the European Committee of the Regions, Vasco Alves Cordeiro[https://cor.europa.eu/en/about/vice-president/Pages/first-vice-president.aspx], said that the kind of inspiration provided by Mayor Adamowicz is needed because “it makes us stronger when democracy is challenged and when fundamental rights are attacked. It makes us stronger to build solidarity and cohesion in Europe and beyond”. [use a direct quote here, if we can]

Nominees for the Award may be proposed by 15 members of the European Committee [of the Regions? Or what committee? Why “15 members”?], [this seems unnecessary], any city or regional council as well as by international organisations with strong engagement and relevant expertise in the fields of the Award. Nominees for the Award may come from or be active in any country in the world. The deadline for submitting nominations is 31 October 2022. The award ceremony will take place in January 2023.

The first Laureate of the Mayor Paweł Adamowicz Award is Henriette Reker[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henriette_Reker], the Lord Mayor of Cologne [https://www.stadt-koeln.de/politik-und-verwaltung/oberbuergermeisterin]in Germany, in recognition of her extraordinary dedication and work in her city in promoting tolerance, inclusiveness, and the integration and non-discrimina​tion of citizens with migrant backgrounds, whilst fighting hate-speech and xenophobia. Amongst the many personal and professional challenges that she has faced in carrying out this work, she survived a near-fatal xenophobia-motivated knife attack in October 2015.

The European Committee of the Regions, as the political assembly of local and regional politicians in the EU, on the initiative of the Polish delegation, unanimously adopted, on 7 February 2019, a resolution [https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/7cb7cdda-7883-11e9-9f05-01aa75ed71a1]condemning hate speech and threats of all kinds against political leaders.

The International Cities of Refuge Network (ICORN) [https://www.icorn.org/]is an international organisation of 75 cities and regions in Europe and beyond, offering safe haven to persecuted writers and artists, advancing freedom of expression, defending democratic values and promoting international solidarity. More than 250 writers and artists have been offered residency in an ICORN city. In a safe environment, they continue to play a vital role, both in highlighting violations of human rights and freespeech in their home countries, and in supporting colleagues in their country of origin. Mayor Pawel Adamowicz brought the City of Gdańsk into ICORN on 30 August 2017.

By joining ICORN, the cities become part of a dynamic and global network of solidarity and creativity. ICORN connects and cooperates with relevant public institutions and civil-society organisations that are active in the field of human rights, culture, arts and migration, as well as governmental and inter-governmental bodies, locally and internationally.

Response to public health threats: EU Commission signs arrangement with the USA[https://portal.ieu-monitoring.com/editorial/response-to-public-health-threats-eu-commission-signs-arrangement-with-the-usa/379590/?utm_source=ieu-portal]

Brussels, 9 June 2022

Following the statement by President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Joe Biden marking the second Global COVID-19 Summit, the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have signed an arrangement to strengthen cooperation on preparedness and response to public health threats. This will enable the Commission and the U.S. to work together on a broad range of topics to jointly tackle health emergencies, contributing to establishing a strong global health architecture.

Stella Kyriakides, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said:

“Today’s first transatlantic arrangement on cooperation in the area of health is an important step in our already close working relationship with the US to counter COVID-19. We share broad mutual interests in the control and prevention of infectious diseases globally. Today we put this cooperation on new footing, to jointly identify health threats, work together on procuring medical countermeasures and prepare for health threats together. As the pandemic has shown us, joining forces will enable us to better deal with future health crises and better protect citizens across Europe and globally.”

Xavier Becerra, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said:

“Strengthening our collaboration with the European Commission through this formal arrangement signifies the importance the U.S. places on working together toward our shared pandemic preparedness and response goals. In addition, this arrangement gives us an opportunity to jointly assist other countries, including those outside of the European Union, with building up their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to public health threats.”

The transatlantic arrangement, signed on 19 May in Berlin, will be coordinated by the European Commission Health Emergency and Preparedness Response Authority (HERA) and the Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety on the EU side and the Department of Health and Human Services on the U.S. side. As part of the arrangement, the European Commission and the U.S. will work together on epidemic and supply chain information, research and innovation, and production of medical countermeasures, including vaccines and therapeutics. By facilitating information, knowledge, and data sharing, the arrangement will reduce duplication and ensure strong synergies in our preparedness and response efforts. In particular, the European Commission and the U.S. will strengthen cooperation on:

Reviewing joint threat assessments with the goal of identifying at least one most relevant public health threat per year on which to collaborate on.

Sharing secured data for global surveillance for the early detection of emerging health threats.

Supporting procurement activities, including the assessment of vaccine platforms and exchange of best practices on vaccine arrangements.

Coordinating support for the research and development of innovative medical countermeasures.

Supporting third countries on preparedness and response to public health threats.

Tackling mis- and disinformation on health threats by exchanging good practices and initiating joint actions.

Background

The present administrative arrangement is a deliverable of the U.S.-EU Agenda for Beating the Global Pandemic, Vaccinating the World, Saving Lives Now, and Building Back Better Global Health Security. It is part of the joint actions announced in the 12 May statement reaffirming the Joint Agenda by President von der Leyen and President Biden on the occasion of the second global COVID-19 summit. It also complements the United States–European Commission Joint Statement on the launch of the joint COVID-19 Manufacturing and Supply Chain Taskforce.

Eurojust: Italian authorities halt fraud against national healthcare system[https://portal.ieu-monitoring.com/editorial/eurojust-italian-authorities-halt-fraud-against-national-healthcare-system/379624/?utm_source=ieu-portal]

The Hague, 10 June 2022

Supported by Eurojust, judicial and law enforcement authorities in Italy and Albania have dismantled a criminal network suspected of committing fraud against the Italian national health system, as well as corruption and drug trafficking. During an action day, nine suspects were arrested. More than EUR 500,000 was seized from the suspects’ bank accounts, together with drugs with a value of EUR 20,000.

The organised crime group (OCG) allegedly operated between the Italian province of Milan and Albania. With the complicity of doctors and nurses working in Italian hospitals, the OGC offered Albanian citizens a variety of expensive and unnecessary medical services that would allow them to enter Italy illegally.

The investigation documented the issuing of false medical certifications stating that the Albanian citizens required urgent life-saving medical treatment in Italy, thereby allowing them to enter the country and receive medical and pharmaceutical services under an exemption regime. Corrupt medical practitioners allegedly cooperated with the OCG in exchange for money or sexual services.

The OCG members are also believed to be involved in trafficking drugs that they illegally obtained from the Italian national health system and sold in Albania. Some of these drugs were used to treat COVID-19 patients and were in high demand during the pandemic.

The investigations ascertained the irregular registration in the Italian national health system of at least 82 Albanian citizens between January 2020 and June 2021. These patients received at least 383 outpatient services and 1 554 specialist visits, inpatient stays and prescriptions, under a total exemption regime.

Eurojust supported the authorities in Italy and Albania with the setting up and funding of a joint investigation team (JIT) in March 2022. Two coordination meetings were also hosted by Eurojust to facilitate judicial cooperation and provide support for the coordinated investigative efforts.

During an action day on 10 June, six suspects were arrested in Italy, three suspects were placed under house arrest and one was under the obligation to sign. Authorities seized over EUR 500 000 from the suspects’ bank accounts, as well as drugs with a value of EUR 20 000.

The following authorities took part in this investigation:

* Italy: Anti-Mafia Milan District Directorate

* Albania: Albanian Special Anti-Corruption Structure (SPAK)

EU facilitates increased exports for Moldovan agricultural products[https://portal.ieu-monitoring.com/editorial/eu-facilitates-increased-exports-for-moldovan-agricultural-products/379587/?utm_source=ieu-portal]

Brussels, 9 June 2022

More Moldovan plums, grapes and other agricultural products should soon be coming to European markets tariff-free. The European Commission has today proposed a regulation allowing for temporary improved market access for the remaining seven products from Moldova which are still subject to tariff rate quotas when entering the EU. This is a demonstration of EU’s solidarity designed to help Moldova deal with the loss of its main markets and transit hubs for these key agricultural products resulting from Russia’s unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, said:

“Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified aggression is not only severely affecting the economy of Ukraine, but also that of its and our neighbours, in this case Moldova. Today’s decision, more than doubling seven quotas for key Moldovan agricultural exports, is a tangible sign of EU solidarity.”

European Commission Executive Vice-President and Commissioner for Trade, Valdis Dombrovskis, said:

“Moldova’s ability to trade with the world has been dealt a severe blow by Russia’s brutal and illegal war. By facilitating market access for key agricultural products, the EU is helping Moldova to redirect affected trade. This will directly help Moldovan producers, supporting the country’s economic resilience in current difficult circumstances. The EU is once again stepping up to support a European neighbour.”

European Commissioner for Agriculture, Janusz Wojciechowski, said:

“I hope that this unprecedented measure will support Moldovan producers in alleviating some of the market pressures in the short-term. In the longer run, we encourage our Moldovan counterparts to invest in processing capacities and higher added-value production. Raising the quality of their products even further will help strengthen the position of Moldovan producers on the EU market. We stand ready to provide technical assistance in this respect.”

Virtually all Moldovan products can already enter the EU tariff-free under the EU-Moldova Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA).

The proposed measures cover the remaining seven products for which exports from Moldova into the EU are not yet fully liberalised: plums, table grapes, apples, tomatoes, garlic, cherries and grape juice. The regulation more than doubles – for the duration of one year – the amount of these products that can be imported tariff-free from Moldova into the EU. The potential tariff-free volumes will now be worth around €55 million, including approximatively €10 million of plums and €27 million of table grapes.

The additional liberalisation of imports into the EU will help Moldovan producers and exporters overcome the market losses they have suffered as a result of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Together with increased access to road transport in the EU (currently being negotiated between Moldova and the EU), the liberalisation should considerably facilitate the export of Moldovan products to and via the EU. In addition, we are open to discuss further reciprocal liberalisation, which would make the EU and Moldova advance one more step in the direction of full trade liberalisation.

Next Steps

The proposal now needs to be considered and agreed by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.

Background

Moldova has benefitted from an Association Agreement, including the DCFTA, with the EU since 2014. This preferential trade system has allowed Moldova to take advantage of the elimination of tariffs for exports to the EU of all goods except seven agricultural products. Moldova also enjoys increased access to the EU services market and better investment conditions. For its part, Moldova has committed to approximating its legislation with the EU acquis in a wide range of areas.

The temporary and exceptional measures proposed by the European Commission today will further support and foster the existing trade flows from Moldova to the EU and support Moldova’s economy. This is in line with the main objectives of the Association Agreement, which are to establish conditions for enhanced economic and trade relations, leading towards Moldova’s gradual integration in the EU Internal Market, as well as to contribute to the strengthening of democracy and political, economic and institutional stability in Moldova.

The EU also supports Moldova with significant financial assistance to help the country deal with the situation created by the Russian aggression in Ukraine.

Ukraine’s association agreements to Horizon Europe and Euratom Programmes enter into force[https://portal.ieu-monitoring.com/editorial/security/diplomacy/ukraines-association-agreements-to-horizon-europe-and-euratom-programmes-enter-into-force/379582/?utm_source=ieu-portal]

Brussels, 9 June 2022

Today, the agreement associating Ukraine to Horizon Europe, the EU research and innovation programme[https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en] (2021-2027) and the Euratom Research and Training Programme[https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/euratom-research-and-training-programme_en] (2021-2025) entered into force, following its ratification by Ukraine. The Ukrainian research and innovation actors can now fully participate in these programmes on equal terms with entities from the EU Members States.

In view of the ongoing Russian war of aggression against Ukraine and the EU’s commitment to offer tangible means of support to the Ukrainian research and innovation community, Ukraine will participate in Horizon Europe and Euratom Programmes without having to contribute financially for years 2021 and 2022. Its waived contribution was estimated at around €20 million.

This support is complementary to ongoing ERA4Ukraine[https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/ukraine], Horizon4Ukraine [https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/ua-opportunities]and ERC4Ukraine [https://erc.europa.eu/funding/additional-opportunities/ERC-for-Ukraine-research-jobs]initiatives as well as the dedicated fellowship scheme of €25 million under the Marie Skłodowska Curie Actions (MSCA) for displaced researchers of Ukraine. Among other support measures, the Ukrainian start-ups and deep tech SMEs will benefit from a targeted €20 million action [https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_3533]led by the European Innovation Council (EIC).

Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth Mariya Gabriel said:

In these critical times, Ukraine’s association to Horizon Europe and Euratom Research & Training Programmes demonstrates the strength of our partnership, which can only grow stronger, as the EU continues to stand with Ukraine. The EU’s strong commitment to nurturing Ukraine’s research and innovation talent is vital both for building broader collaboration under our Association Agreement as well as for the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine.

The association supports the ’Global Approach to Research and Innovation[https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2465]’ and reconfirms Europe’s commitment to a level of global openness needed to drive excellence, pool resources for faster scientific progress and develop vibrant innovation ecosystems.

Background

Relations between the EU and Ukraine in the field of research and innovation date back to 2002 when the European Community and Ukraine signed an Agreement on cooperation in Science and Technology.

In 2015, Ukraine became fully associated to Horizon 2020 with 170 Ukrainian entities receiving close to €46 million in EU funding and showing innovation leadership and excellence in researchers’ mobility, under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, as well as in transport and energy.

The prominent examples of success stories include: DIABOLO[http://diabolo-project.eu/], developing harmonised information for forest ecosystems management, SENSKIN[https://www.senskin.eu/] offering new maintenance techniques in transport infrastructure, RESPONSE [https://h2020response.eu/]focusing on eco-solutions to power the cities of the future, and EURAD [https://www.ejp-eurad.eu/]handling radioactive waste management.

In 2016, Ukraine and the EU also concluded an agreement on the association of the country to the Euratom Research and Training Programme. The Euratom Research and Training Programme aims at improving the levels of nuclear safety and radiation protection.

MEPs: Do not approve Polish recovery plan until conditions are met[https://portal.ieu-monitoring.com/editorial/meps-do-not-approve-polish-recovery-plan-until-conditions-are-met/379617/?utm_source=ieu-portal]

Strasbourg, 9 June 2022

* Parliament criticises Commission for endorsing the Polish government’s €35.4 billion Recovery and Resilience Facility plan

* Call on Council to not approve the plan until all conditions are met

* Need for robust monitoring and verification mechanisms each step of the way

MEPs worry that the Commission’s milestones are not enough and stress that full compliance with EU values is a prerequisite for Recovery and Resilience Facility funding.

In a resolution adopted on Thursday with 411 votes in favour, 129 against, and 31 abstentions, Parliament expresses grave concerns about the Commission’s endorsement[https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_3375] of Poland’s €35.4 billion plan under the Recovery and Resilience Facility[https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/recovery-coronavirus/recovery-and-resilience-facility_en] (RRF).

MEPs once again point to the existing and continued breaches[https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200910IPR86860/poland-council-has-to-finally-act-to-protect-minorities-and-the-rule-of-law] of the values enshrined in Article 2 TEU[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/treaty/teu_2012/art_2/oj], including of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, and deplore that, because of the Polish Government’s actions, funding has not yet reached the people of Poland.

No money until compliance with EU law and values is guaranteed

MEPs reiterate that the rulings of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), as well as the primacy of EU law[https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20211014IPR14911/poland-meps-call-for-the-primacy-of-eu-law-to-be-upheld], cannot be treated as bargaining chips. They point out that compliance with EU values is a prerequisite to have access to the Facility and that the rule of law conditionality mechanism is fully applicable here.

They strongly urge the Council to only approve Poland’s plan once it has fully complied with the provisions of the RRF Regulation[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021R0241] on conflicts of interest and fraud and with all European Semester[https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/european-semester/european-semester-timeline/2022-european-semester-cycle_en] country-specific recommendations in the field of the rule of law. Poland also needs to implement all relevant judgments of the ECJ and the ECtHR before its plan can be approved. MEPs also highlight that the key steps towards implementation (milestones) related to the financial interests of the European Union must be fulfilled before a first payment request is submitted.

Commission’s conditions not enough, and will need consistent monitoring

The closure of the illegal Disciplinary Chamber and the transfer of its functions to another chamber of the Supreme Court is one of the Commission’s key conditions. A robust system will need to be in place to verify this process and a probation period, to ensure that the relevant standards are met.

MEPs regret that the issues regarding the illegitimate Constitutional Tribunal[https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20211015IPR15016/poland-constitutional-tribunal-is-illegitimate-unfit-to-interpret-constitution] and the illegitimate National Council of the Judiciary are not addressed in the milestones, and call for an infringement procedure. Lastly, they recall that whether or not a country is observing the rule of law and managing EU funds correctly are to be evaluated continuously, including to ensure that reversals are avoided. Based on this monitoring and assessment taking place, the Commission must stop disbursing funds at any point in the RRF cycle, or should even recover them where applicable.

Background

In 2017, the Commission initiated a procedure under Article 7[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012M007] to address a possible risk of breach of EU values in Poland. Parliament has since repeatedly asked the Council to act, and in 2020 warned about further backsliding[https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20211210IPR19220/eu-values-in-poland-meps-concerned-about-continuous-deterioration]. MEPs have repeatedly called for the conditionality mechanism[https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220304IPR24802/rule-of-law-conditionality-commission-must-immediately-initiate-proceedings] to be activated to protect the EU budget from breaches of the rule of law in Poland.

ECB monetary policy decisions on 9 June 2022[https://portal.ieu-monitoring.com/editorial/ecb-monetary-policy-decisions-on-9-june-2022/379615/?utm_source=ieu-portal]

9 June 2022

High inflation is a major challenge for all of us. The Governing Council will make sure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term.

In May inflation again rose significantly, mainly because of surging energy and food prices, including due to the impact of the war. But inflation pressures have broadened and intensified, with prices for many goods and services increasing strongly. Eurosystem staff have revised their baseline inflation projections up significantly. These projections indicate that inflation will remain undesirably elevated for some time. However, moderating energy costs, the easing of supply disruptions related to the pandemic and the normalisation of monetary policy are expected to lead to a decline in inflation. The new staff projections foresee annual inflation at 6.8% in 2022, before it is projected to decline to 3.5% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024 – higher than in the March projections. This means that headline inflation at the end of the projection horizon is projected to be slightly above the Governing Council’s target. Inflation excluding energy and food is projected to average 3.3% in 2022, 2.8% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024 – also above the March projections.

Russia’s unjustified aggression towards Ukraine continues to weigh on the economy in Europe and beyond. It is disrupting trade, is leading to shortages of materials, and is contributing to high energy and commodity prices. These factors will continue to weigh on confidence and dampen growth, especially in the near term. However, the conditions are in place for the economy to continue to grow on account of the ongoing reopening of the economy, a strong labour market, fiscal support and savings built up during the pandemic. Once current headwinds abate, economic activity is expected to pick up again. This outlook is broadly reflected in the Eurosystem staff projections, which foresee annual real GDP growth at 2.8% in 2022, 2.1% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024. Compared with the March projections, the outlook has been revised down significantly for 2022 and 2023, while for 2024 it has been revised up.

On the basis of its updated assessment, the Governing Council decided to take further steps in normalising its monetary policy. Throughout this process, the Governing Council will maintain optionality, data-dependence, gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy.

Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)

The Governing Council decided to end net asset purchases under its asset purchase programme (APP) as of 1 July 2022. The Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance.

As concerns the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.

In the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions at any time. This could include purchasing bonds issued by the Hellenic Republic over and above rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, which could impair the transmission of monetary policy to the Greek economy while it is still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic.

Key ECB interest rates

The Governing Council undertook a careful review of the conditions which, according to its forward guidance, should be satisfied before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates. As a result of this assessment, the Governing Council concluded that those conditions have been satisfied.

Accordingly, and in line with the Governing Council’s policy sequencing, the Governing Council intends to raise the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at its July monetary policy meeting. In the meantime, the Governing Council decided to leave the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.

Looking further ahead, the Governing Council expects to raise the key ECB interest rates again in September. The calibration of this rate increase will depend on the updated medium-term inflation outlook. If the medium-term inflation outlook persists or deteriorates, a larger increment will be appropriate at the September meeting.

Beyond September, based on its current assessment, the Governing Council anticipates that a gradual but sustained path of further increases in interest rates will be appropriate. In line with the Governing Council’s commitment to its 2% medium-term target, the pace at which the Governing Council adjusts its monetary policy will depend on the incoming data and how it assesses inflation to develop in the medium term.

Refinancing operations

The Governing Council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy. The Governing Council will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance. As announced previously, the special conditions applicable under TLTRO III will end on 23 June 2022.

The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, incorporating flexibility if warranted, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2% target over the medium term. The pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and conduct of asset purchases has helped to counter the impaired transmission of monetary policy and made the Governing Council’s efforts to achieve its goal more effective. Within the ECB’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability.

The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.

Main themes on selected current affairs programmes on Austrian TV on 4-8 July

Austrian media public broadcaster ORF's prime news show ZIB2, commercial channel OE24's daily debate Fellner! Live, and commercial broadcaster Puls24's programme Newsroom Live continued to focus on the domestic economic woes during the period under review.

Party analysis

As parliament broke off for the summer, public broadcaster ORF's prime news show ZIB2 on 4 July at 2000 gmt analysed the work of the OeVP ruling party. Political analyst Thomas Hofer, thought the problem of the OeVP was the cumulative effect, which was slowly manifesting itself and which could result in really lasting damage to the image of the People's Party.

Hofer noted two streams that had coincided: On the one hand, a situation "wherein every government is a passenger, with this wave of price increases, with inflation, with the consequences of the war, it's clear that you're just being driven there."

However, the crux of the problem from the point of view of the OeVP was that inflation goes hand in hand with a perpetual party crisis, with almost weekly stories of potential corruption affairs, which from the point of view of the OeVP, "started to grow into a serial novel".

According to Hofer, "that's a toxic mixture, because in a crisis everyone understands that it's not easy for politicians, but at the same time, of course, the party has given the impression that some party members embezzled or misused public funds, at least in the past. And that doesn't end well."

Hofer saw a lack of strategy in the OeVP and thought that Federal Chancellor Karl Nehammer could have chosen a much more offensive strategy, like by making a big impact with the Freedom of Information Act, the Transparency law, or the Party law, to seize control of the narrative.

Hofer remarked on "uncertainty in the OEvp because of some targeted voter groups that are now significantly smaller, but still cling to the era of former chancellor Alexander Kurz, whom Nehammer didn't want to alienate, and therefore stop him from going on the offensive".

The result was, according to Hofer, a haphazard course, which did not reflect positively in surveys and did not allow the OeVP to improve.

Inflation fears

On commercial channel OE24's daily debate Fellner! Live on 5 July at 1900 gmt, two political analysts and authors, Sebastian Bohrn Mena and Gerald Grosz, talked about the galloping inflation in Austria.

Bohrn Mena questioned whether the federal government had any options to stop the price hikes. "So I understand that it doesn't hit the alarm button when it really doesn't have anything to react with". Bohrn Mena cited Federal Minister of Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology, who had argued that in an emergency there was a legal basis for the government to nationalise the Austrian gas storage facilities, to make sure that in winter all energy resources could be used for the benefit of the country. "So in winter, when push comes to shove, we can take them, even though they don't belong to us."

Bohrn Mena admitted that Austria would not be able to get the gas that it was storing on behalf of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany and thought that the saving tips, recently offered by individual ministers, such as venting radiators were unnecessary.

The political expert opined that the government would need to provide financial aid to the Austrian population: "What I would expect in the current situation is, I think we're up from 5,000 euros, because that's going to be swallowed up by the gas bills. We need to go closer to 10,000 euros. I believe that we really need 10,000 euros per household, socially graded."

He cited a recent study pointing to the unequal distribution of income and wealth "and you can see some are getting richer and richer in the crisis." The study showed that 20% of Austrians managed to earn more in the last three years, while there were 1.8 million people who earned less.

"There are more and more people going to the social markets," Bohrn Mena said, "but the social markets also have empty shelves because nothing more comes in. That means what we are experiencing right now is actually a total redistribution from bottom to top again."

He argued that the federal government would actually be required to act, "because we cannot change that at the checkout, we cannot change that even at the thermostat, and even if I can do without meat that will not change anything about the fact that some people are benefiting from the crisis as always and hurt a lot".

Gerald Grosz responded that the sanctions imposed by the European Union on Russia has had a strong impact on Austrian finances. "The economy is faltering. We are in an age of de-industrialization because the economy is being deprived of energy resources."

Grosz recalled that "only four weeks ago", Bohrn Mena had celebrated an announcement by the government to pay 3,000 euros as a one-off payment to each household "as an epochal sociopolitical achievement".

"Now you sit here and say we need 10,000 euros but now I'll tell you the following, Grosz argued: "the 10,000 euros will fizzle out again. It will fizzle out again because two months ago we talked about gas price increases of 134%. But today I saw a gas bill from a Viennese company that has to pay a surcharge of 500%. From week to week we discuss price increases from 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 200, and now 500%."

Grosz reminded his counterpart of the basic needs of people: gas, heating, electricity, food, basic foodstuffs. "We are talking about the basic needs that are currently being stolen from people. and now I come back to what said around 13 March 2022, when I warned that these sanctions will lead to the destruction of our economy. Grosz argued that the six sanction packages that the EU had directed against "the aggressor in Moscow", did not affect the aggressor. "He's celebrating the highest rouble levels since 2019 and we're being killed here."

Grosz demanded an immediate price cap on fuel, gas, heating oil, electricity, staple foods and an intervention by the Austrian federal government for the immediate "lifting of these sanctions that are destroying our economy - that is the order of the day".

Party law, inflation, energy shortages

Commercial broadcaster Puls24 dedicated its news show Newsroom Live on 8 July at 1755 gmt to a discussion on the newly-adopted party law, the rising inflation, fears of energy supply shortages, and the low level of trust in politics.

In an interview with PULS 24 anchor Fabian Kissler, Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler (Greens) talked about the "massive burden" caused by inflation, which the government was trying to mitigate, although he spoke against a price cap for electricity and gas.

The vice chancellor admitted that the current rise in gas and electricity prices was an immense burden for the population. This was "of course a massive increase in price, a massive burden". In the future, however, this would "have a lot to do with the energy transition". But in the short term, the government was taking measures to "mitigate inflation". Families would "actually" be relieved and supported "with emergency aid and direct aid" - "usually" with "several thousand euros a year".

In response to the criticism of the measures taken by the government, Kogler replied that it was "dishonest" "to pretend that inflation can be magically eliminated".

Kogler agreed with his German colleague Robert Habeck when he said that economic upheavals "can lead to these price increases". But one should not act as if one could turn back energy prices.

Still, Kogler rejected a cap on electricity and gas prices: "If we were to do this alone in Austria, we would be subsidising electricity prices in Germany, the Benelux countries, Poland and Czech Republic". Rather, the problem had to be solved at EU level.

But with "a 20% increase in inflation" the state would "have to intervene". In addition, however, one had to realise that the gas market was fundamentally organised privately, which was a "huge problem". In the event of a gas shortage, however, the energy management would take effect anyway. In this case, Austria would have full access to its "huge storage facilities".

But Austria was also dependent on the lines, so cooperation was needed, said Kogler. Gas pipelines would have to be made available "from Rotterdam, down from Norway, up from Trieste". "And we could make our storage capacities available."

Kogler admitted to the public's low level of trust in the government and saw "certainly room for improvement". However, he said he "merely glanced at party preferences" and that he "really had something else to do than look at opinion polls."

The Green politician rejected criticism of the party law that had been passed by the political party the New Austria and Liberal Forum (NEOS). "Nevertheless, it remains the case that this is a really big hit." There were now "strict regulations that the donations have to be disclosed at all". The Court of Auditors could take a look when associations that were linked to parties crossed the sphere - every transfer of a donation could now be checked. Austria was one of the countries with the "strictest laws in Europe," said Kogler.

EU minister meeting on tightening Russia sanctions, says Schallenberg

Kyiv/Moscow - The EU foreign ministers were due to meet in Brussels on Monday to discuss the EU Commission suggestion for sanctions against Russia. According to Austrian foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg (conservative People's Party, VP), the meeting was about tightening the sanctions against Russia, and filling in loopholes - it was not about "another sanction package".

On the subject of gas coverage, "sound judgement" was needed. The EU sanctions against Russia would have a long-term effect, he said.

"I know that there is an increasing discussion, also within Europe, concerning sanctions", said Schallenberg. The sanctions were "not a measure with an immediate effect", but with a long-term effect. One needed to avoid the trap and take up the Russian narrative that sanctions did not work. They were expecting the Russian economy to collapse by ten percent, while the EU would still have just over two percent growth.

97 percent of the Russian automobile industry had to stop production, and three-quarters of Russian air travel was grounded as the plane maintenance was stopped. In addition, hundreds of thousands of Russians had also already left their home country.

There was no alternative to sanctions against Russia over its war of aggression against Ukraine. "Do we want a work which is based on rules, or do we want the law of the jungle?", he said.

Main themes on selected current affairs programmes on Austrian TV on 19-20 July 2022

The war in Ukraine and the economic woes of the population were the main topics covered by Austrian media during the period under review. Commercial broadcaster OE24's debate programme Fellner! Live focussed on inflation, the commercial channels Puls24's news programme Newsroom Live accompanied the foreign minister on his trip to Ukraine; while public broadcaster ORF's prime news show ZIB2 asked how one of Austria's regions would implement measures to reduce energy consumption.

Causes of inflation

The commercial broadcaster OE24's debate programme Fellner! Live on 19 July at 1900 gmt witnessed as every Tuesday, a clash over the reason behind the soaring inflation between the two political authors, Sebastian Bohr Mena and Gerald Grosz.

After Bohrn Mena blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for the rising energy prices around the world, Gerald Grosz who announced that in the autumn he would be running for the country's presidency, argued that inflation had nothing to do with the war in Ukraine:

"If the Russian army fires missiles at Donetsk, it has no effect on Europe. It does have an impact on the tormented population over whose heads explosive devices go off. But it's not an impact on Europe, and the fuelled inflation".

Russian rockets don't reduce gas flow

Grosz thought that the main drivers of any inflation were the energy resources and there was no doubt that in today's scenario inflation was pushed by gas on the one hand and oil on the other. "I am not aware of Putin's armies having blown up gas tanks. However, I do know that the European Union threatened to stop importing gas into the European Union and that Mr Putin turned off our gas supply in response to six sanction packages".

The right-wing author blamed the European Union for burying the Nord Stream 2 project and being surprised that no more gas was coming to Europe. "No wonder the prices are going up," he said.

Grosz recalled that "we live in a globalised world, where the economy is so tricky that when the big market in Europe is smashed like it is right now and on the other hand the big market in China is being massively strengthened, America itself falls behind here", and argued that inflation did not stop at the shores of the Atlantic in Spain or Portugal, but was a poison that equally gripped large parts of the world.

Russia's budget surplus

He contrasted "the disastrous inflation" with that week's news that Russia had a budget surplus of several billion euros and that "the euro was now weaker than ever".

Grosz explained that a failed economic policy in the context of the Corona crisis management in Austria also had its effects on inflation. Another reason was the collapse of the global supply chains that were caused by China's zero-Covid policy. "We also have a problem there, because China is the main supplier to Europe. Of course we also have a problem with the logistics, no question. But the main drivers of inflation in Europe at the moment, and all experts agree, are the commodities gas and oil. And as long as you play and turn these cogs, you don't have to be surprised that inflation skyrockets," said Grosz.

Inflation profiteering

Sebastian Bohr Mena recalled that the Association for Consumer Information (VKI) had filed a lawsuit against the Verbund AG. The state-owned energy provider, who advertised "100% from Austrian hydropower" and generated large amounts of electricity from hydropower, "tied its prices to the global market, where they had gone through the roof". The VKI was therefore - on behalf of the Ministry of Social Affairs - seeking a judicial clarification as to whether such a pricing clause was permissible.

"This has nothing at all to do with the fact that Russia attacked Ukraine and the European Union is therefore sanctioning Putin," Bohrn Mena argued and thought that a committee to oversee inflation or cost-of-living should be created, "because in the current situation there are people and companies who were lining their pockets".

Benefits of weak euro

Bohrn Mena picked up on Gerald Grosz "panic with regard to the weak euro". According to Bohrn Mena, many Austrian companies were rejoicing over the falling euro-dollar exchange rate, because exports were much cheaper and "the Austrian economy was making much, much more sales because in some areas there was a 90% export orientation". Therefore, he rejected Grosz's argument that the weak exchange rate would be so fatal for the domestic economy, as Austria were generating a foreign trade surplus. "It's not all black and white".

He, therefore, insisted that the war in Ukraine, initiated and driven by Russia, was having a significant negative impact not only on the people there, but also on the people here. In any case, Bohrn Mena concluded, the solution could not be "that we let the Ukrainians die or that we now send our money back to Putin".

Junk currency, beneficial for export

Gerald Grosz responded that according to Bohrn Mena's theory, "we should have a junk currency. Then our foreign trade relations should be at its best".

"So if your theory is that our currency has to be so weak for us to be able to export properly, then we should send the euro to hell at all, because that's obviously the best way to go". Grosz thought that this theory was wrong as the strength of a currency also showed the strength of the economic area: the weaker the currency, the weaker the economy.

He continued by saying that "our economic area is currently being destroyed because we are destroying our economy because we are marching into an age of de-industrialization, on the one hand as a result of the Corona measures and on the other hand through a destructive sanctions policy that has achieved nothing."

Purpose of sanctions

According to Grosz, sanctions had only one purpose, and that was to divert the country that was being sanctioned from its current path. We knew, however, that Russia would not be dissuaded, and still we were sending our seventh package of sanctions, "which will not work either. We destroy and but ourselves."

He argued that the goal of the sanctions was never achieved. Russia would not be stopped in its actions and would continue to pursue its security policy interests. While the sanctions looked like punishment, the punishment did not have an impact in Moscow.

Bohrn Mena disagreed and argued that these sanctions helped because "we are sending a sign of solidarity with Ukraine and because we are systematically cutting off the Russians from doing business with the world". Unfortunately, we were still far too dependent, he said, which was why the sanctions were not taking effect to the extent that the Western alliance would have liked.

Sanctions need time

Bohrn Mena referred to experts and said that sanctions, unlike war, took a long time and compared them to a marathon "and with the marathon you have to be prepared that it will take time."

Still, he insisted, as with the Corona plans, one could not stop relying on protective measures, as many people continued to get infected with the virus. And just because we had no way of stopping Russia from throwing bombs on Ukraine, we could not stop aiding the victims.

"I believe that we must implement the sanctions with full force. I am of the opinion that they still need to be strengthened, but and this is very, very important, we will only stick to these sanctions as the European Union if we compensate our citizens and ask the companies who are now making billions in profits to pay accordingly," said Bohrn Mena.

High-level visit to Ukraine

On Wednesday, 20 July, Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg (OeVP) and his Czech counterpart Jan Lipavsky went to Ukraine and visited the airport in the Kiev suburb of Hostomel as well as Irpin. In Irpin, faced with the numerous ruins of residential buildings, Schallenberg emphasized that these pictures would "get under your skin". The trip to Ukraine was initially planned in the so-called Slavkov format (Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia), but the Slovakian Foreign Minister Ivan Korcok had to cancel at short notice due to a corona disease.

In an interview with commercial channels Puls24's news programme Newsroom Live on 20 July at 0905 gmt, Schallenberg pointed out that as an Austrian, one had to realize that all this happened "in the immediate vicinity", just a few hours by train from Vienna. "It also shows something, as we saw earlier at the airport, how massively the Russian Federation, especially Vladimir Putin, has miscalculated." The Russian troops actually thought that "they will be received with bread and salt and that they will not be shot at". This showed how heroically Ukraine defended itself, but also that there was never anything nice about war. "War is horrific, war is death, war is destruction," said the Foreign Minister.

Citing Irpin's Mayor Oleksandar Markushin, Schallenberg the foreign minister said that 95 percent of the residents of Irpin, a city of about 100,000 people, had fled the community during the fighting. In the meantime, 75 percent of the residents had returned. According to Schallenberg, Markushin had asked Austria to help with the reconstruction, because more than 100 buildings in the city, including schools and kindergartens, as well as numerous residential buildings had been completely destroyed. Schallenberg promised to help "to give people perspective again where possible".

Law of the jungle

Shortly before the outbreak of war the Austrian politician had already been to Kyiv with his counterparts from the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Schallenberg recalled during the trip. At that time there was still hope for diplomacy. "Less than two weeks later, there was a brutal breach of civilization, which we honestly didn't think was possible at the time," said the Foreign Minister.

"It's a question of whether the law of the jungle applies or whether a rule-based order applies. We need a world where international law applies, where the rule of law applies, where the principle of pacta sunt servanda applies, where the law of the strongest does not apply," he emphasized. The Foreign Minister was convinced that what Russian President Vladimir Putin certainly had not expected was the strong unity in Europe.

As a neutral state, Austria was primarily providing humanitarian aid, with around 80 million euros in financial support. "We brought 980 tonnes of relief supplies to Ukraine by truck and we were the first European country to set up an airlift from Moldova for displaced people," stressed Schallenberg.

Aid for Ukraine will not end

80,000 Ukrainian refugees have found refuge in Austria, and his country had also provided 38 fire and rescue vehicles, Schallenberg revealed and promised: "This aid will not end. We will continue to stand by Ukraine in solidarity. We will rebuild this country - if it is possible again," said Schallenberg.

In any case, this trip was "a clear sign of solidarity from Central Europe, that the Slavkov-3 are acting as one," because the three states are also among the four states that have taken in the most Ukrainian refugees per capita", according to Austria's foreign minister. "The goal is that Putin doesn't win. Putin didn't succeed in destroying Ukraine, he didn't succeed in dividing the West," said Schallenberg.

On the same programme, the Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky added that his country would continue to provide military support to Ukraine and that the goal was for Ukraine to win the war. "Czech Republic has been in Russian orbit for 40 years and we don't want to get under Russian influence again," Lipavsky said.

Measures to reduce energy consumption

On public broadcaster ORF's prime news show ZIB2 on 20 July at 2000 gmt the governor of Austrian region Carinthia, Peter Kaiser (SPOe) spoke out in favor of speed reductions on motorways. Official price controls for groceries or rent upper price limits against inflation had also to be discussed, said Kaiser.

When asked about specific energy-saving plans, Kaiser said that in the event of a gas emergency, priority would have to be given. It would be about areas where there was higher energy consumption, such as heating swimming pools and schools. If he had the choice, he would rather keep important industrial companies running and strive for a speed reduction of a few km/h, Kaiser suggested in an interview with ZIB2 moderator Martin Thuer.

There were several ways of making food more affordable, Kaiser continued: "Either you do something with the tax - that's a nationwide decision - or you say the price for my roll, which in my bakery went up from 0.20 to 0.30 euros, do not exceed a certain limit. That's the affordability. It is important here that the federal government weighs up which is the better way."

In general, he was concerned with "protecting the poorest and making sure that the middle class doesn't get crushed," even in the face of inflation, warned Kaiser. In this way, the average consumption that a household in Carinthia needed should be made available in an affordable way. In the case of additional consumption, higher tariffs could then also apply, said the Carinthian governor.

Information on the organizational and technical requirements for participation in the virtual shareholders' meeting

English translation of original German version for convenience only

Petro Welt Technologies AG

FN 69011 m

Resolutions proposed by the Management Board and the

Supervisory Board

for the Extraordinary General Meeting on 16 August 2022

Agenda item 1:

Sale of the participations in Russia.

The Management Board and the Supervisory Board propose to the shareholders to approve the sale of the Company's participations in Russia.

Rationale

Petro Welt Technologies AG (the "Company") currently considers selling its Russian business segment (the "Transaction"). The Management Board and the Supervisory Board believe that due to current EU and U.S. sanctions against Russia on the one hand and Russian counter-sanctions against the EU and the U.S.A. on the other hand the sale of all of the Russian subsidiaries is the only option available (i) enabling the Company's Russian subsidiaries to continue their business activities and (ii) for the Company to receive the current fair market value for its Russian business segment.

The current EU and US sanctions and Russian counter-sanctions regimes still allow the Transaction to be carried out with the proposed terms and conditions. There is a possibility that the sanctions regimes will be tightened or changed in the future, which may adversely affect the possibility of the Transaction or its terms and conditions.

1. Current situation

The Company is primarily engaged in oil drilling, fracturing, side-tracking and related oil services for major Russian and Kazakhstan oil producing companies. During the last several years the Company started investigating the Romanian and Oman markets for similar services and entered into similar agreements and holds equipment for the provision of similar services in these countries.

In order to manage its Russian operations, the Company requires Russian managers having knowledge of the local market. Such people are usually Russian citizens or residents and are subject to Russian legislation.

The Company and its subsidiaries in Russia have close ties with the EU and the U.S.A.:

* Depending on the type of services, from 40% to 80% of the equipment used for oil services performed by the Company and its subsidiaries in Russia is imported from the EU and the U.S.A.

* 35% of all spare parts and consumables are imported from the EU.

* The Company's equipment requires regular technical servicing with the involvement of EU technical specialists.

In Russia, 70% of the Company's services are carried out on basis of contracts with Russian energy companies which are either directly or indirectly controlled by the Russian Federation or named in the EU sanctions lists.

EU Sanctions

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) No. 833/2014 (as amended, "General Sanctions Regulation"), and Council Regulation (EU) No. 269/2014 (as amended, the "Personal Sanctions Regulation") the EU introduced certain restrictions in respect of operations and transactions directly affecting the Company, its top managers and its Russian subsidiaries and their operations:

* A significant part of the clients of the Company's Russian subsidiaries are sanctioned persons. Thus, the Company and its Russian subsidiaries cannot continue rendering services to most of their clients. It is generally prohibited to directly or indirectly engage in any transaction with publicly controlled or publicly owned Russian entities listed in Annex XIX of the General Sanctions Regulation. The same prohibition applies to transactions with any legal person established outside the EU that is, directly or indirectly, owned for more than 50% by a listed entity and to any legal entity acting on behalf or at the direction of a listed publicly controlled or publicly owned Russian entity or of a non-EU legal person which is owned for more than 50% by a listed entity.

* Financing the Russian energy sector is prohibited. The Russian subsidiaries of the Company and their clients are companies "operating in the energy sector". Thus, the Company cannot grant loans or credits (or other similar financing or investments) to its Russian subsidiaries. EU Member States are prohibited from participating in providing financing, including loans or credit (also by equity capital) to, or creating new joint ventures with any entity or body incorporated or constituted under the laws of Russia, or any other third country and operating in the energy sector in Russia. EU Member States are also prohibited from providing investment services related to these activities. However, the competent authorities of the EU Member States may authorize specific investment activities under certain conditions. The European Commission qualifies the Russian subsidiaries of the Company and their customers as companies "operating in the energy sector" in the meaning of the General Sanctions Regulation. Thus, the above-mentioned prohibitions apply with respect to financing activities regarding the Company's Russian subsidiaries. It is uncertain whether Austria will approve any financing of the Company's Russian subsidiaries on an individual basis. From today's point of view the Company cannot grant new loans or credits (or other similar financing or investments) to its Russian subsidiaries.

M.12979914.1

* Providers of software and hardware like Microsoft, Siemens, VMWare, Cisco, TeamViewer, Hewlett Packard, Lenovo and others used by the Russian subsidiaries of the Company ceased supporting their software and refuse to extend licenses in the territory of Russia . This creates an additional significant risk for the operations of the Company's subsidiaries in Russia.

* The Company's investment program in respect of the purchase of new equipment for the operations of its Russian subsidiaries, its technical servicing, etc. cannot be performed any longer, which puts the operations performed by the Company's Russian subsidiaries at risk. Besides, normal operations of the Russian subsidiaries of the Company using their existing equipment become virtually impossible in the absence of technical support from the Company or EU contractors. Wide export related prohibitions are in place. It is prohibited to sell, supply, transfer or export, directly or indirectly, listed goods or technology, including certain types of oilfield equipment, whether or not originating in the European Union, to any individual or legal entity in Russia or for use in Russia. Furthermore, the financing or financial assistance and technical assistance related to such goods and technology to any individual or legal entity in Russia or for use in Russia is prohibited. Furthermore, the same export related prohibitions apply in respect of certain listed goods and technology suited for use in oil refining (e.g. chemicals used for oil refining) and such listed goods and technology that could contribute to the enhancement of Russian industrial capacities (e.g. numerous industrial goods, such as propane as produced by Wellprop, one of the Company's Russian subsidiaries).

* As a result of the asset freeze sanctions on Russian banks the Company will need to reconsider any financing arrangements or even maintenance of bank accounts of Russian subsidiaries in long-term used Russian banks to prevent the violation of EU sanctions by the Company (e.g. through approval of financing transactions of Russian subsidiaries with blocked banks or through remittance of funds on bank accounts of Russian subsidiaries in blocked banks). The Company may be unable to provide or may risk violating broad representations and warranties in its financing agreements with foreign banks, if the PeWeTe Group maintains relations with blocked Russian banks. Asset freezes and prohibitions from making funds and economic resources available to sanctions listed individuals and entities were imposed by the EU. Asset freeze sanctions were imposed on significant Russian banks, including VTB and Sberbank. Financing agreements of the Company with foreign banks may contain strict representations and warranties that trigger violations in case the PeWeTe Group interacts with entities that are subject to EU asset freeze sanctions. Even if not relevant for current financing arrangements, going forward, foreign banks may request such representations and warranties in new financing agreements given the increased sanctions pressure on Russia.

M.12979914.1

* The EU sanctions regime, including potential liability for its violation and potential criminal liability, applies to the Company, its management and other persons having the right to direct the Company's decisions in respect of matters affected by EU sanctions. The EU sanctions apply in the territory of the EU, to any legal person or entity in respect of any business done within the EU, and worldwide to any national of an EU Member State and to any legal entity which is incorporated or constituted under the laws of an EU Member State. In addition to the general and direct applicability of the EU sanctions a legal transaction in breach of EU sanction measures is punishable under the Austrian Sanctions Act (Sanktionengesetz 2010) with administrative fines of up to EUR 50,000 or, in case the transaction relates to assets worth more than EUR 100,000, with criminal penalty (imprisonment of up to one year). Generally, both Austrian administrative penalty and criminal laws are applicable to all offences committed within Austria. In that regard, an offence will be deemed committed in Austria if (i) the offender has acted or should have acted in Austria or (ii) a result corresponding to the offence has occurred in whole or in part or should have occurred according to the offender's conception in Austria.

U.S. sanctions

Pursuant to Executive Orders 14024, 14066, 14071, Directive 2 to Executive Order 13662 and Directive 3 to Executive Order 14024 ("Executive Orders") and in the U.S. Export Administration Regulations ("EAR") the U.S. introduced certain restrictions in respect of operations and transactions directly affecting the Company, its top managers and its Russian subsidiaries and their operations:

* Due to the restrictions on certain USD denominated transactions the Company will be significantly limited in its ability to provide USD financing to its Russian subsidiaries operating in the energy sector in Russia or any other sector of the Russian economy. The Company will be significantly limited in its ability to receive payments in USD from and to make payments in USD to non-sanctioned Russian counterparties. US sanctions measures do not, as a general matter, bind non-US persons in their transactions outside the United States. However, those measures apply to transactions that involve the provision of banking and other financial services within the United States, even if other activities related to the transaction occur elsewhere. Because USD-denominated electronic transfers will, in practice, be processed through a financial institution within the United States, such transactions are required to comply with U.S. sanctions. It is prohibited that such non-US person undertakes a new investment in the energy sector of Russia in USD cleared through or transferred with the involvement of a US correspondent bank. Further, new investments in Russia are generally prohibited This includes, inter alia, lending funds to Russian entities and purchasing debt or equity securities issued by Russian entities; before or after 6 June 2022. The maintenance or divestment of investments made prior 6 June 2022 is not prohibited, unless this involves expansion of any pre-existing projects or operations beyond those in effect prior to 6 June 2022. Furthermore, any transactions involving Russian banks under the U.S. blocking sanctions, which includes such major banks as Sberbank, VTB and Alfa-Bank, may violate U.S. sanctions.

M.12979914.1

U.S. financial institutions are required to block such transactions, which would result in the funds being frozen and as a practical matter lost for the foreseeable future, or in some cases reject the transactions, which would result in the funds being returned and the payment not processed. In addition, causing or attempting to cause a prohibited transaction could subject the company and its employees to criminal or administrative penalties. Criminal penalties can include up to 20 years of imprisonment and up to USD 1 million in fines per violation, or both. Administrative penalties can reach up to USD 330,947 per violation or twice the value of the transaction, whichever is greater.

* The Company and its Russian subsidiaries may need to terminate financing products from Russian banks that are subject to blocking sanctions (such as Sberbank) and may need to reconsider other dealings with them. The U.S. may block all property and interests in property, which is in the U.S. or within the possession of any U.S. person, of a non-U.S. person which "materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of" certain activities or certain sanctioned persons and such property and interests in property may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn or otherwise dealt in. The property of significant Russian banks, such as Sberbank, VTB and Alfa-Bank have been blocked under Executive Order 14024. Financing and other transactions with Russian banks that are subject to the U.S. blocking sanctions may, depending on their scope, volume and conditions, trigger sanctions risks for non-U.S. participants that are not blocked. Financing agreements of the Company with foreign banks may contain strict provisions that trigger an event of default or other consequences if the PeWeTe Group transacts with entities that are subject to U.S. blocking sanctions. Albeit not relevant for current financing arrangements, foreign banks may in the future insist on including such representations and warranties in new financing agreements, given the increased sanctions pressure on Russia.

* The Company's investment program in respect of the purchase of new U.S. origin equipment for operations of its Russian subsidiaries cannot be performed any longer, which puts the Russian companies' operations at risk. The EAR requires a license for export, re-export or transfer to or within Russia of all "items subject to the EAR" that are listed on the Commerce Control List ("CCL") and sets forth a policy of denial for the required licenses. The requirements of the EAR apply regardless of the nationality of the exporter, to "items subject to the EAR". Such items include (i) all items in the U.S.A., (ii) all U.S.-origin items, wherever located, (iii) foreign-made software that is commingled with controlled U.S.-origin software, and foreign-made technology that is commingled with controlled U.S.-origin technology, and (iv) certain "foreign direct products" (where a non-U.S. item is the "direct product" of U.S.-controlled software or technology or plants that use certain U.S. software or technology). The CCL includes, as export-controlled items, certain oil exploration equipment and other items that may be relevant for oil extraction projects.

Hungary's Orban defends 'cultural standpoint' in race remark row

Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Thursday defended his comments against creating "peoples of mixed-race", saying they represented a "cultural" standpoint.

"It happens sometimes that I speak in a way that can be misunderstood... the position that I represent is a cultural... standpoint," Orban told reporters during a visit to neighbouring Austria.

Orban sparked a storm of criticism after he warned against mixing with "non-Europeans" in a speech in Romania's Transylvania region, home to a Hungarian community, on Saturday.

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said in a joint press conference with Orban that the issue had been "resolved... amicably and in all clarity", adding his country "strongly condemned... any form of racism or anti-Semitism".

The International Auschwitz Committee has urged the European Union -- and Nehammer specifically -- to distance themselves from "Orban's racist undertones".

Austria is the first EU country to host Orban for talks since he won a fourth straight mandate in an April landslide.

Besides the race row, the two leaders discussed migration and energy security amid tensions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Vienna sees itself "as an honest broker" and is anxious not to sideline Hungary, an Austrian official told AFP on condition of anonymity.

Jewish community representatives voiced alarm after Orban, an ultra-conservative known for his anti-migrant policy and virulent rhetoric, said that "we do not want to become peoples of mixed-race".

The 59-year-old also seemed to allude to the Nazi German gas chambers when criticising a Brussels plan to reduce European gas demand by 15 percent following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Hungary was the only EU member to oppose the plan, which passed on a majority vote this week.

An adviser to Orban, Zsuzsa Hegedus, resigned on Tuesday, slamming his speech as "a pure Nazi text".

In response, Orban stressed his government's "policy of zero tolerance when it comes to anti-Semitism and racism", according to a letter made public.

"I am proud of the results which Hungary achieved against racism in recent years," Orban told reporters on Wednesday.

Both Orban and Nehammer said they would not support any embargo on Russian gas, on which their countries are heavily dependant, with Orban describing any such embargo as a "wall".

"My advice to the European Union is not to hit this wall," said the Hungarian, who recently slammed the EU's sanction policy against Russia as "Europe shooting itself in the lungs".

He added that he wished Brussels would come up with a new "strategy that is good for the Ukrainians, good for us, good for the European economy and good for the households that have to pay the price of energy".

"Only open anti-immigration politician in EU", says Orban

Vienna - During his visit in Vienna the controversial statement on "race mixing" and gas chambers of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was addressed. "I am the only open anti-immigration politician in the EU", Orban said. This was "not an issue of race, but of culture", he said after meeting Chancellor Karl Nehammer (Conservative People's Party, VP) on Thursday.

Nehammer made it clear "that we in Austria reject in the strongest possible terms any form of trivialisation and relativisation of racism and anti-Semitism".

His critique on migration was "not a racist, but cultural question". He does not want migration to intensify, Orban said.

In a speech in Romania on Saturday, Orban had given a heavily criticised rejection of "race mixing". He also caused outrage with a joke alluding to the Nazi gas chambers.

"It happens that I sometimes formulate things in a misleading way. However, Hungary's position in this regard is "not a biological one, but a civilizational one".

Orban and Nehammer both emphasised the joint fight against illegal migration.

Nehammer critiqued the EU Commission for tardiness regarding the joint gas purchase by EU countries. "A joint energy platform would be more important than ever", Nehammer said - then EU countries would not compete with each other.

The EU member states have laid the path for a decision-making procedure for an emergency plan to curb gas consumption. The plan was aimed at reducing the risks which could result from a total stop of Russian gas deliveries.

Orban criticized the EU sanction strategy against Russia in general as a means to the war in Ukraine. Nehammer was confident that the sanctions against Russia would sooner or later have an effect.

Orban also warned of future war economy and recession. A mandatory rationing of natural gas "is the first sign of a war economy", Orban said after meeting Nehammer. If the war did not end soon, this would lead to a recession and in consequence to mass unemployment in Europe, Orban warned.

Iran inflexible on IAEA probe as EU tables nuclear deal revival

The only changes after four days of talks in Vienna to a draft Borrell circulated on July 21 were the resolution of some technical questions, diplomatic sources said of the final text.

The European Union has put forward a "final" text to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal[https://www.jpost.com/tags/iran-nuclear-deal], a senior EU official told reporters on Monday, but Iran said it still is not ready to reach an agreement, continuing to demand that an investigation into alleged clandestine nuclear activities be dropped.

Indirect talks between Iran and the United States to save the 2015 pact[https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-714081] resumed in Vienna last Thursday, with talks’ coordinator, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell, writing days earlier that there would not be “additional significant compromises” anymore.

“Given the continuation of discussions on some remaining important issues, we’re not yet at a stage to finalize the text. Iran has presented its constructive views to other party so as to move forward & the result is up to their political decision.”

Iranian Foreign Ministry official

The only changes after four days of talks in Vienna to a draft Borrell circulated on July 21 were the resolution of some technical questions, diplomatic sources said of the final text. Among the technical matters were restoring cameras meant to monitor Iran's nuclear program, which Tehran removed in protest in June, and a small amount of uranium enriched to 60% purity, which cannot be shipped out of Iran as stipulated by the deal.

Russia’s lead negotiator Ambassador Mikhail Ulyanov tweeted that “the participants in the Vienna Talks now need to decide if the draft is acceptable for them. In case of no objection the nuclear deal will be restored.”

However, an Iranian Foreign Ministry official told state media outlet IRNA that “given the continuation of discussions on some remaining important issues, we’re not yet at a stage to finalize the text. Iran has presented its constructive views to other party so as to move forward & the result is up to their political decision.”

The Islamic Republic’s nuclear negotiators planned to return to Tehran as the latest round of talks came to a close, according to IRNA.

Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said on Sunday that the nuclear pact depended on Washington's flexibility.

Iran's non-JCPOA demands

Tehran, however, continued to make demands that were external to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the 2015 deal is known. Iran has insisted since February that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps be removed from the US State Departments Foreign Terrorist Organization list, but has reportedly dropped that, agreeing to negotiate it separately with the US.

However, Iran continued to demand that the International Atomic Energy Agency[https://www.jpost.com/international/article-713903] drop its probes into undeclared nuclear sites.

The IAEA has said Iran failed to provide credible responses to its questions about the origins of the uranium particles. The West suspects the particles are proof that Iran had a nuclear weapons program.

“The Iranian regime seems to prefer to protect some individuals involved in clandestine activities 20 years ago instead of freeing its economy and opening up the future for its people," a European diplomat told Politico.

The JCPOA lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for limiting – but not eliminating – its nuclear program. Those restrictions would be lifted over time, in what is known as sunset clauses, through 2030, and most would be gone by 2025.

The US left the JCPOA in 2018, with then-president Donald Trump[https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-713856] calling it weak and ineffective and opting to sanction Iran instead. The US under President Joe Biden entered indirect talks to revive the deal in early 2021.

However, Washington was skeptical that the latest round of talks in Vienna would yield a return to the JCPOA.[https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-713026]

The State Department said last week that the US has “been prepared to close a deal and immediately begin reimplementation based on the outline on the table since March.”

“In order to reach a deal, Iran will have to drop demands that are extraneous to the JCPOA,” said a State Department spokesman. “We hope that will be the case, though at this stage our overall expectations remain low.”

Iran Urges US to Retreat from Unconstructive Positions in Talks

TEHRAN (FNA)- Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian reiterated that removal of sanctions against Tehran is a prerequisite for striking a deal with the world powers, and stressed the need for the United States to end its unconstructive policies during the negotiations.

The Iran’s top diplomat made the remarks in a Monday phone conversation with the European Union Foreign Policy Chief, Josep Borrell, in which the two sides discussed the latest developments surrounding the nuclear talks in the Austria's capital.

Amir Abdollahian told Borrell that the Iranian delegation has been serious and determined to achieve an agreement in Vienna and has offered its constructive ideas for the resolution of outstanding issues.

“Iran’s views and considerations on the ideas offered by [Borrell’s deputy] Enrique Mora have been conveyed to him and all parties [to the deal] are expected to show seriousness and resolve in order to achieve the final text of the agreement,” the high-ranking official noted.

Iran’s foreign minister added any final agreement must meet the rights and interests of the Iranian nation and guarantee sustainable and effective removal of sanctions imposed on the country.

He expressed hope that the path to a final agreement would be paved through realism and by avoiding adoption of nonconstructive positions, especially by the United States.

Earlier in the day, a senior official in Iran’s Foreign Ministry stated during fresh talks on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) revival in Vienna, Tehran informed the opposite parties of its positions and “relative advances were made on a number of issues".

Pointing to Mora's several ideas on a number of outstanding issues, the unnamed official noted, "As soon as we received these ideas, we informed him of our answers and primary considerations. Naturally, such issues need more comprehensive discussions and we will convey our additional views and considerations to the [JCPOA] coordinator and other parties.”

The official added that relative progress has been made during the new round of talks, but progress has been slow in some other areas.

After several months of impasse, sanction removal talks resumed on Thursday. Expert-level negotiations had been held between Iran and the P4+1 group of countries.

Late Monday, a top official of the European Union declared that the negotiations on finalizing a draft text for potential agreement on the revival of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal have come to an end, and that the delegations (the P4+1 group, including Britain, France, Russia, China plush Germany), as well as Iran and the United States would leave Austria.

Meanwhile, an Iranian Foreign Ministry official dismissed the reports that a text for restoring the 2015 accord with Tehran had been completed and that negotiations in Vienna were finished.

"Given the continuation of discussions on several important remaining issues, we are not yet at a stage where we can talk about the finalization of the text," the unnamed official was quoted as saying by IRNA news agency late Monday.

"The negotiating team of the Islamic Republic of Iran has presented its constructive opinions to the other side with the aim of advancing the negotiations, and the outcome of the talks depends on the will of the other side to make the necessary political decisions," the foreign ministry official continued.

"We still believe that if appropriate decisions are made by the other side, the negotiations can be concluded quickly, but we are not at this stage yet," the official added.

Iran: Agreement in Vienna Depends on US to Adopt Realistic Approach https://t.co/Rlqu1lnlHy[https://t.co/Rlqu1lnlHy] pic.twitter.com/A7JwBiGH7x[https://t.co/A7JwBiGH7x]

— Fars News Agency (@EnglishFars) August 9, 2022[https://twitter.com/EnglishFars/status/1556859615073165314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]

Iranian officials say the ball is in the US' court, and the administration of President Joe Biden should assure Tehran that it will not repeat Donald Trump's past mistakes.

Iran and the five remaining parties to the nuclear deal have held several rounds of negotiations since April last year to restore the agreement, which was unilaterally abandoned by Trump in May 2018.

In quitting the agreement, Trump restored sanctions on Iran as part of what he called the “maximum pressure” campaign against the country. Those sanctions are being enforced to this day by the Biden administration, even though it has repeatedly acknowledged that the policy has been a mistake and a failure.

Iranian officials have criticized Washington for raising excessive demands from Tehran during the nuclear talks, and blocking efforts to reach an agreement on the JCPOA. They emphasized the Tehran's will to reach a good, strong and lasting agreement, and stressed that the US should lift unilateral sanctions, and assure Iran that it will not repeat its past mistakes.

OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome, and thank you for joining the Vienna Insurance Group conference call.

(Operator Instructions)

I would now like to turn the conference over to Nina. Please go ahead.

NINA HIGATZBERGER-SCHWARZ, HEAD OF IR, VIENNA INSURANCE GROUP AG: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to our 2022 half year results call of Vienna Insurance Group.

Here in Vienna, Hartwig Loger, our Deputy CEO, Liane Hirner, our CFO; and Peter Hofinger, member of the Managing Board in addition to his country responsibilities in charge of corporate business and reinsurance. We will start with an overview and update on VIG 25 given by Hartwig Loger, and Liane Hirner will guide you through the financial results details.

I now hand over to Hartwig Loger.

HARTWIG LOGER, DEPUTY GM & DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE MANAGING BOARD, VIENNA INSURANCE GROUP AG: Thank you, Nina. Very warm welcome also from my side. On behalf of VIG, it's a pleasure to welcome you to this presentation of half year 2022 results. Before I give an overview and then actual information about the status of VIG 25. I want to, on Page 2, give you an overview about the results of '22, which will be then in detail presented by Liane Hirner. I think, first of all, it's a strong half year result from VIG Group at all, which underpins also the resilience which we see coming out from our business model, which as you know, is very specific in the management principles. And in the way we are giving flexibility to the local management, the entrepreneurship.

It is the possibility also in the times we have now that they are acting local. And this, I think, decentralized approach of VIG is really now also showing a beneficial in that case. What we also want to remark in the summary is that our strong capitalization in the solvency ratio of 285% is also on the 1 side, a safety basis and gives us also the chance for growth, which is part of our VIG 25 strategy.

And of course, we all the time are looking for opportunities in which way we can go on in our positioning as #1 in Central Eastern Europe. The positive top line performance, you have already seen is important for us that it is out of all segments. And so in this case, it shows that this resilience is not only coming from some regions, but it is really on a broad basis over the whole group.

Strong technical results underline also by a very positive way of the combined ratio we are showing. And what we also announced is that the measures we are taking for the Russian government and corporate bonds. We are also increasing and 3/4 of the overall exposure we have in safe.

So it is, at the moment, of course, always the interest from all sides to hear a clear expectation about the outlook for the year-end. In this case, we want to announce that we are really expecting to achieve a positive operative performance at the end of the year, showing the strong result of half year. But please be aware that we are not able due to the ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainties, mainly coming out of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the war there that we are not able to define it in detail now. Now I want to go on as it was announced with maybe a short information about the status of VIG 25.

As you know, last year in April, it was confirmed by the Supervisory Board of VIG to start this strategic program, VIG 25. We took the chance in May, this year, to do a first evaluation together jointly with all the CEOs of our group. So it was important because the program also was developed with all CEOs and now with the impact of the situation, as I mentioned, Ukraine, but also inflation and the framework around, we decided after 1 year to check in which form our frame, we discussed for this program, is still remaining and in which form we have maybe also to go on.

On chart #5, you see the frame on the basis shown in this kind of flower. These have been the main trends when we discuss the VIG 25 program starting 2 years ago. And in a very short term, you here can see in which discussions with the CEOs evaluated and where we see the impact of the changing environment which is shown maybe -- and I don't go in detail now, but overall, that we have, of course, still the discussion about the interest rates basis. And here, in this case, we, on the one side, see that the real interest rates, especially on the European Union level or euro room is remaining still rather low.

On the other side, of course, the nominal interest rate has a different impact also, if we call on the capital side. The pressure out of this, what we see now is that the pressure on technical result is increasing, of course, of inflation increase. This and was also part of our initiatives we started last year already. And what we see now also for this half year results '22, that these trends and also the initiatives and actions we set and started already are really working in the right form and the strong technical result also showing now is also in connection to what we already started.

So in this case, we still see it's valid that we are on the right track concerning also these topics. What we see on the other side is that, of course, we also get opportunities out of what we've see now because when we have on the worldwide situation of supply chain issues that there might be also possibilities of investments that foreign direct investments, regional independence is also driving opportunities for near shoring, which also came a little bit underlying and strengthen our positioning in the possibility of the market. Concerning the customer access and the trends, we also said in the VIG 25 with clear initiatives on that way.

We, on one side, see that there might be a lack of growth tailwinds because when we see economic slowdown and the impact on the purchasing power, this might a little bit shift the spending patterns. But on the other side, we also develop in a strong form, platforms, digital platforms, we are creating ecosystems where we go beyond insurance. And we see that this already is bringing also positive impact in the way for future growth and also the possibility to be near to the customers.

The latent demand concerning also insurance and financial products, we had, as a trend, at the beginning of VIG 25. Here, of course, we have this nominal interest rate hike. And here, we see also positively influencing the demand of life insurance in the direct way, but we see also that these latent demand will even be more persistent out of the development we see now.

On the next page, going deeper to the actual discussion about the rise of the inflation. First of all, it's important to mention that there are, of course, very different numbers in the ratios of inflation in the markets we are working on. But overall, we have, of course, the impact, which is on the motor and property side, mainly concentrated in the discussion about claims inflation because the costs there are, of course, increasing. And out of that, it is important that in the possibility to go against, we see the chance of premium increase, but also on the side of product modification, also claims handling processes which we already started also as parts of initiatives in our VIG 25 program.

Out of the discussion I mentioned with our CEOs, it is clear that there is a higher dynamic in the way we have to act in this way to bring down the costs on one side and to -- I would say, also develop the technical results and the combined ratio, especially in this way. So there are a lot of activities over the companies of the group.

And as I mentioned in the overall results, this is one of our USP that we have a lot of creativity in the regional markets, and there is a big change in between the best practice models we can take there. Especially in Austria, we have, in this case, the indexation for various lines of business. In the CE countries, we have mainly year-by-year contracts where we also see the chance to increase premium in the renewal of the yearly-based contracts.

Life & Health, the inflation, of course is also influencing, maybe on one side that there might be lower interest for new business. But on the other way, we also see the possibility on the cost side that they're -- we have partnerships with private clinics. We have the chance also here for premium increase, also in combination with the market. And in Life, we see that the profitability of in-force business will also benefit from better investment margin on the saving products. And so out of this, we have also here the possibility for improvement.

The next chart #7 shows an overview about the basis of our initiatives defined in this VIG 25. We have, on the one side, the horizon named optimize the current business model. So here, we are focusing really in simplification of processes and automation. It was already mentioned that this is one important factor in the activities to really have a decrease in costs. And out of that, this is also underlying and influencing positively, the running and also the future results we are showing in that way, also in underwriting and pricing and also in changing the best practices out of that.

Enhancing the second horizon, this is to give additional customer value. And in that form, we are in the way of bringing in new services, new products in combination with insurance products. This also is over the last year, a very positive factor in improving premium and income. And the third horizon in the name of expand is all we call beyond insurance. There, we really expand the value chain in the way that we are creating the way of platforms. We are also the ecosystems in a definition that shows that, for example, in health, but also in motor, we have a lot of opportunities to create also new forms in the way of the services for our customers.

The next slide, #8, is one of, I think, the main factors also showing that VIG 25 is a clear definition about 1 side, the core markets of Central Eastern Europe. So the 20 core markets described and shown here, segmented on 1 side in top 5 CEE markets. You'll see in the color red shown here, Austria included also in this definition of CEE markets, Czech, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland. So there is a special focus in between these 20 core markets on these 5 top markets.

And about the other CEE markets, of course, we are also developing a strong clear target in the positioning. Overall, we are in the VIG 25 strategy program defining that there we are ready, and we are looking forward to become top 3 position in all our Central Eastern markets. And besides that, there are the special markets, 10 special markets where we act in the way of niche players with specific goals and also specifically concentrated on product lines.

Now touching maybe also the current situation about the Aegon CEE. We had in the transaction also of the first half of '22. To give this current information, we had the chance already to close Aegon Hungary. It was in the 23rd of March this year. And immediately after that, we also could close the agreement in the partnership with the Hungarian government. And out of that, we are now in Hungary, as we defined it in the strategy in the #1 position of this top 5 market in between our core markets with 19% market share.

And we are really expecting a strong win-win partnership between VIG and Corvinus, which is the company aligned with the Hungarian government, and so the first actions already started and give a positive expectation also in the development of this positioning in Hungary.

We also, on the 21st of April, closed Aegon Turkey. So also in that way, it is the base is fixed that we can go on in taking the synergies out of the activities together of these 2 companies we are now running. And this transaction also opened the chance for us to start life business in Turkey besides the already running property. Aegon's remaining CEE business to touch in that form, we are still in the way of working that Poland and Romania will also be able to close the transaction until the end of this year. And so in this way, also a positive expectation.

At least on the Slide #10, I want to touch in the introduction also the successfully placement of EUR 500 million bonds, which was successful in 2.7x oversubscribed demand. And so this was despite challenging capital markets environment, I think, also a very positive important step. The background was that there was also accompanied by a partial repurchase of a bond issued in 2013 with first call date in 2023. So this was also in the strategy, the background of this successful bonds despite. So altogether, I think that this first half result is fitting well in the activities. We started with VIG 25. It shows that strong resilience is also based on clear definition of strategic expectation.

And now I want to hand over to our CFO, Liane Hirner, which will now give you detailed information about the financial results of the first half. Over to you.

LIANE HIRNER, MEMBER OF THE MANAGING BOARD, CHIEF FINANCE & RISK OFFICER, VIENNA INSURANCE GROUP AG: Thank you, Hartwig. And also a warm welcome from my side. Now let's move to Slide 12. I am happy to present a strong set of key figures for the first half of 2022. VIG once again demonstrates an excellent operating performance and the resilience of its business model in challenging times. Premium growth continued to be strong in the second quarter, which increased in all lines of businesses and segments, leading to gross written premiums of EUR 6.4 billion in the first 6 months of this year. The increase in profit taxes by 10.3% was supported by a very good technical result in P&C.

Please note that the result of EUR 277 million includes impairments and precautionary measures related to the Russian bond exposure on which I will come back in more detail in a few minutes. We are pleased that not only our profit increased, but our net result was up by 8.6% leading to earnings per share of EUR 3.05.

Our combined ratio improved by 0.9 percentage points and is a favorable 94.3% driven by a better claims and cost ratio. Last year's cost ratio of 32.2% was impacted by costs for IT and digitalization projects. The group solvency ratio came in strong at 285% based on the increase in the risk-free euro yield curve and the issue of the Tier 2 capital, which Hartwig mentioned before, with a nominal value of EUR 500 million, the solvency ratio of VIG improved substantially from 250% at year-end 2021 to 285% as of June 2022.

In spite of the repurchase of part of the Tier 2 bond issued in 2013, which already been mentioned before by Hartwig and the stock market declines. Let me add that 1/3 of the increase of the solvency ratio is stemming from own funds increase, 2/3 are coming from reused SCR.

Now let's have a quick look on the income statement on the next slide, Page 13. Overall, the strong profit performance of VIG in the first half of 2022 is mainly driven by a better technical result. The decline of around 10% in the financial result is coming from measures in relation to the Russian sovereign and corporate bond exposure, which I already mentioned before.

Overall, we have provided for more than 3/4 of the roughly EUR 165 million exposure, which -- with measures taken in the first half of this year. Our tax ratio of 25% is in line with the previous year, and we expect it to be at this level or so at year-end. Over the page on Slide 14, we show the premium development by segment. It has already been mentioned that all our segments recorded strong growth, once again demonstrating the advantages of local entrepreneurship.

Our group companies know best about the local insurance needs, which is reflected in the top line growth of 11.6%. Among the main contributors were Czech Republic and Extended CEE with double-digit growth rates in motor and other properties.

Group functions recorded a plus of 22.7% in order -- in other property with positive contributions from corporate business as well as internal and external reinsurance. This leads me to Slide 15, where we provide an overview of our premiums by line of business. As you can see, on this slide, not only all segments, but also all business units grew in the first 6 months of 2022. The trends are similar to the first quarter this year with motor, other property and Health showing double-digit growth rates. The extraordinary growth of 20.3% in motor third-party liability business was mainly driven by Romania year after the bankruptcy of City Insurance, more than 3 million clients had to search for a new insurance provider.

Now let's move on Page 16, where we show the profit before taxes by segment. Let me start with the most obvious development, which is in Austria. The decrease in this segment is mainly caused by the measures taken in relation to the Russian investment exposure. There is a small impact due to these measures also in the Extended CEE segment, but this was offset by the good results, especially from Bulgaria, Romania and Albania. The result development in the Czech Republic was driven by the increased combined ratio due to higher claims frequency and weather-related claims. In Poland, the decrease of EUR 5.2 million resulted from a declined financial result mainly due to less income from disposals of investments.

Over the page, Slide 17, let's have a look at the combined ratio in the P&C business, which shows a rather mixed picture in the first half year. Overall, the group's combined ratio improved to 94.3% based on positive developments in Austria, Poland and Extended CEE. Increases in the combined ratios in the Czech Republic in special markets are among others, due to higher claims frequency. Claims frequency is also the driver for the increase in claims ratio in Turkey and Georgia, bringing the combined ratio despite the decrease in cost ratio to 94.4%.

With this, I move to the financial results, which shown on Page 18. In the first 6 months this year, we had higher income from the disposal of investments compared to last year, driven by the sale of investment funds and bonds.

However, overall, the financial result decreased by 10% due to the sanction driven trading suspension of Russian sovereign and corporate bonds, impairments in the amount of around EUR 83 million have become necessary.

In addition, we have also included a further precautionary measure booked in other expenses. With these measures, we have provided for more than 3/4 of the Russian, sovereign and corporate bond exposure of, in total, around EUR 165 million.

Now let's move on Slide 19. The split of the EUR 34.4 billion investment portfolio is stable compared to year-end with a solid bond rating structure and no substantial changes in the bond issuance split. The share in deposits and cash of 11.1% compared to 9.3% at year-end 2021, derived from the newly issued EUR 500 million subordinated Tier 2 instrument and the partially repurchased bond in the amount of EUR 215.6 million.

Before we move to the Q&A, I would like to once again highlight the good operating performance our group in a challenging market environment. And I would like to point out that we will stick to our successful business model. The upcoming and long expected accounting changes under IFRS 17 and 9 will have no impact on our business model.

We have made further progress in the implementation of IFRS 17 and 9 and decided on relevant accounting options. Moreover, we have decided on the valuation approaches for the defined IFRS 17 portfolios, Property & Casualty, Life and Health Insurance. The detailed description is given in our half year financial report 2022, which is available on our website as of today. At this stage, the impact on the balance sheet of the first-time adoption of the new accounting standards cannot be reliably quantified, but we expect to be able to announce the effects on equity and the contractual service margin, CSM, at the date of first time adoption on January 1, 2022 in the course of the first month 2023.

With this, I end my presentation, and we are ready to take your questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) The first question is from the line of Youdish Chicooree from Autonomous Research.

YOUDISH CHICOOREE, NON DESIGNATED MEMBER, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: I've got 3 questions, please. The first one is on claims inflation in your P&C business. Could you tell us in which markets and lines of business are you seeing the greatest inflationary pressures, and how confident are you that you'll be able to take the necessary actions to maintain your combined ratio at the current 94%, 95% level? That's my first question.

My second question is on the premium growth in P&C. I mean you told us what happened in Romania and why we are seeing very strong growth. But I was wondering if you could give us some color as well on the growth we are seeing in the Austrian and the Czech Republic as well, please?

And finally, it's more a clarification on what you said on IFRS 17. So just to be clear, I mean, so we will not see basically like a pro forma financial statement before January 2023. Is that correctly understood? Those are my 3 questions.

HARTWIG LOGER: Thank you for the questions. I'll take the question for claims inflation. Again, it's a very mixed picture all over the place, how claims inflation is developing. But there are various factors. On one hand side, we see overall in the group in the first half year, an increase, specifically also in motor business of the average premium to counterbalance issues of an increased average claim. As mentioned in the introduction, Principal and CEE, we have 1-year contract. So therefore, we also have the possibility to have a quite quick reaction time on the claims situation. In Austria, we have indexations and we have very specific indexation. So for example, for the CASCO business in Austria, there is a car repair cost index, which is not just the consumer price index, but specifically on the repair costs.

In motor business, you also have to be aware that the average age of the cars we are insuring in Central Eastern Europe is around 14 years, quite different maybe to Western Europe or to markets like in Germany where we talk about 4 or 5 years, which also means that certain topics of spare parts and supply chain topics and microchips problems. We do not have here in Central Eastern Europe. As spare parts are not a new technology, you [have] them from aftermarket topics.

Another topic, even though it has been mentioned that there is a certain increase of our frequency. Nevertheless, our frequency level in motor business is still below the market pre-COVID crisis. This is also driven, I assume, by one topic in Central Eastern Europe. There is a much stronger correlation between gas prices and mileage driven as the disposable income of our customers in CEE is significantly lower in Western Europe. Gas prices are on a similar level. Therefore, if gas prices are close to doubling, automatically, people have a lesser mileage driven.

I think this is to the topic of how we see certain instruments in tackling the issue of claims inflation. If I also come to the premium growth in P&C, looking at Austria. On one hand side, you see a quite stable growth in Motor TPL. You see an increased growth in CASCO, which is on 1 hand side, driven by higher prices of new cars, is the deduction of new cars is not any more than in the past, which is the denominator for the premium level and the indexes, which I was mentioning.

Other property, it's similar. On one hand side, it is certain indexes and new clients in the retail business. On the corporate side, we have been able in the renewal last year for [January 1, '22] to push for rate increases successfully, which can be seen in the premium growth. Quite similar. The top is in Czech Republic and additionally here also a certain exchange rate effect, which is very much a pushing up the premium growth on the euro level.

LIANE HIRNER: Thank you for your question regarding IFRS 17 and 9. Let me say that, in general, the project is progressing according to plan, and we are currently intensively working on the opening balance sheet as of January 2022. But we will not show a performance financial statements for 2022 before beginning of 2023. So this is.

OPERATOR: The next question comes from the line of Thomas Unger from Erste.

THOMAS UNGER, ANALYST, ERSTE GROUP BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. I would start with the Aegon acquisition. And I was wondering what is causing the delay right now to complete the overall transactions for the remaining parts of the transaction? And then relating to the acquisition, what was the impact of Hungary and Turkey -- of the Hungary and Turkey purchases on the Q2 results and also the solvency ratio.

And staying with the solvency ratio, next question would be your -- would you consider -- I mean, excluding the transitionals, you're at 256% now. That's way above your 150% to 200% range that you would target. Do you consider this as excess capital ready? Are you looking at some larger M&A transactions or anything on the horizon right now or any other use of capital if you're in such, if you would describe it as excess capital territory.

And then another one on OMV's share at refinery. Are you involved in this. Do the shutdowns have any impact on you, the shutdowns now in Q2 of the refinery. Is that any impact on your financials?

And then lastly, on your outlook, 2022, I'm just wondering why you like ready to give any more specific targets for the end of the year? Maybe if you could talk about what you're targeting in terms of premium growth for the end of the year. I would really appreciate that.

HARTWIG LOGER: So thank you for your question. I will start in the answer for the Aegon transaction. As I also, in my introduction, mentioned, we could close in Hungary and Turkey, and we are still working in Poland and Romania. The special topic there is that the Romanian company is branch of the Polish company. So we are here in -- working in the combination of the institutions in Poland and Romania in parallel. There are some communication links we have to fulfill. And this is why there is a little delay in the way of closing that. So there is no, I would say, situation that we cannot expect in closing over the autumn of the next month.

And out of that, we are in line to fulfill all demands, which are given there. So out of that, we are really looking forward that end of this year, we will have the final closing overall.

Maybe I hand over to Liane for your question about the financial impacts.

LIANE HIRNER: Okay. Thank you. Regarding the financial impact, the first time consolidation of Aegon Hungary and Aegon Turkey has not taken place so far. We are introducing the -- including the 2 companies in our systems currently. So it's the first time consolidation is planned in the third quarter retrospectively April 1, 2022 for Aegon Hungary and May 1, 2022 for Turkey. So no effect on premiums or results in the half year financial statements. We only have booked the investments.

Regarding solvency, the same situation, only the investments are included in the assets. If Aegon will be closed, after the closing, the solvency -- group solvency ratio, impacted negatively by approximately 15 percentage points less group solvency ratio.

HARTWIG LOGER: Concerning O&D Mr. Unger, I can understand your interest to this topic. Please let us respect the Data Protection Act that I can't even say that OMV is a client from us. But I would like to ensure you that we do have a conservative reinsurance policy. So even single large manmade losses should not have a significant impact on our balance sheet.

LIANE HIRNER: And regarding your second question, which relates to our high group solvency ratio as of half year. Here, I would like to remind you again that Aegon deal has not been included so far. So there should be a reduction of around 15 percentage points. And currently, we are -- according to our VIG 25 strategy, have a clear focus on organic growth but also M&A as Hartwig already mentioned, in our core countries, we are aiming to have the -- or to be amongst the leading companies in the various countries. So there's a clear focus on that. And last but not least, times are quite uncertain, also the economic and political environment. So we feel quite safe with this high ratio at half year. Hope this answers your question.

THOMAS UNGER: Okay. Thank you very much. Yes, it does. I really appreciate it. And maybe if there's anything you can say about the outlook 2022 and premium growth?

HARTWIG LOGER: So I will try, but I hope you're not angry about when I will repeat what I did in my introduction. So we really yes, expect a strong operative result, not only on a technical basis, also on a growth basis, but we do not see the change at the moment to give a detailed definition about this growth ratio.

OPERATOR: The next question is from the line of (inaudible) from HSBC.

UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: A couple of questions from my side. The first one would be on the Russia-Ukraine investment you have given an amount of EUR 165 million nominal exposure to corporate and government bonds. During first quarter presentation, you spoke about close to EUR 190 million of total investment exposure. Just wanted to understand, would you say that the remaining part is less respectable to impairment for precautionary charges? That would be my first question.

The second one would be again on Romania. You have grown quite significantly in the MTPL line, obviously, because of Citi's exit from the market. But at the same time, your combined ratio has improved versus 1H '21 versus 1H '22. I presume that MTPL land is quite competitive with significantly higher combined ratio.

So just wanted to understand what is it that you are doing very differently in Romania, which is allowing you to put a strong combined ratio over there? Those were my 2 questions.

LIANE HIRNER: I'm happy to take your first question regarding the Russian sovereign and corporate bonds exposure, which amounts to EUR 165 million impaired the difference to the EUR 190 million, which we gave you in the first quarter are super-nationals, it is a bond in the amount of approximately EUR 30 million, which is now excluded from the exposure.

HARTWIG LOGER: Thank you for your question to Romania. The bankruptcy of Romania, which had a market share of 45% in Motor TPL. Maybe one could also assume or think that bankruptcy was maybe caused by insufficient technical premiums. The market has changed since then. So there is a different premium level in the market, even though there is certain limitation by the authorities of the premium level, which we are having -- one has to be aware that there is an obligation to contract in Romania for Motor TPL. So if you are having the Motor TPL license, you have to sell to the client to your tariffs, which have been approved by the authorities. We're also benefiting currently from economies of scale, having the higher volume and having it same time, a strict cost management and premium level is now technically on a better level than it was the years before.

OPERATOR: There are no more questions at this time. I hand back to Nina for closing comments.

NINA HIGATZBERGER-SCHWARZ: So thank you, everybody, for your interest and for listening in. In case of further questions or if you're interested in a follow-up call, please get in touch with Investor Relations. We are happy to help. Goodbye.

OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded, and you may disconnect your telephone. Thank you for joining, and have a pleasant day. Goodbye.

Sanctions against Putin - Resistance in Austria

No longer a majority for EU punitive action. Growing pressure on Chancellor Nehammer

Christoph B. Schiltz

Vienna

Is this just a slip or already a foretaste of winter in Germany and Europe? In view of rising energy prices and high inflation, the mood in Austria is turning toward Russia sanctions. According to a new survey for the newspaper "Standard ", 40 percent of Austrians are already mostly (18 percent) or definitely (22 percent) against continuing the sanctions imposed as a result of the Ukraine war. Only 46 percent are currently in favor of the punitive measures.

In Brussels, developments in Austria are viewed with concern. EU diplomats are wondering whether the mood in Germany, the Netherlands or Italy will soon change as well. One thing is certain: European consumers are unlikely to really feel the impact of the energy price explosion, which is largely due to reduced natural gas exports from Russia, until the fall and winter. This could then lead to heated debates in several member states, said one diplomat. "Then even the sanctions as a whole could be called into question," a scenario that would play into Russia's President Vladimir Putin's cards - but seems entirely conceivable. After all, the European Union's decision on sanctions requires unanimity. In addition, the punitive measures have to be renewed every six months.

In Austria, the debate is currently picking up steam. According to a joint poll by the APA news agency and the ATV television channel, 42 percent of Austrians do not believe that the sanctions against Russia will have any effect - "neither now nor in the future." Only 28 percent, on the other hand, expect them to have an effect in the medium or long term. How will the coalition of the conservative ÖVP and the Greens react to this mood in the country? A week ago, Chancellor Karl Nehammer (ÖVP) said that anyone calling for sanctions against Russia to be lifted was "irresponsible." The Foreign Ministry said in a statesmanlike manner: "The sanctions are having an effect - a little more every day (...) We want a rules-based world order, not the law of the jungle, where the strongest can simply take what he wants." But for days now, the pressure on Nehammer has been increasing.

In the latest Sunday polls, the ÖVP is doing poorly and would only get 21 to 22 percent in parliamentary elections - depending on the institute. The Social Democrats (SPÖ), on the other hand, are at 28 to 30 percent. On the other hand, the right-wing nationalist FPÖ is breathing down the ÖVP's neck, with a current approval rating of 20 to 22 percent. Unlike the ÖVP, the Freedom Party is strictly opposed to sanctioning Russia. So if the mood in the country continues to turn against the imposed punitive measures, the ÖVP risks soon being overtaken by the FPÖ. That would be a nightmare for the governing party.

At the same time, four state elections are just around the corner. In September, elections will be held in Tyrol, and next spring in Lower Austria, Carinthia and Salzburg. The ÖVP is already facing disaster in its traditional strongholds of Tyrol (2018 election result: 44.2 percent) and Lower Austria (2018: 49.6 percent), with forecasts predicting results of only around 30 percent for the conservatives, who were once used to success.

For weeks, Austria's media and the opposition have been speculating about the end of Chancellor Nehammer and early elections. Parliamentary Speaker Wolfgang Sobotka (ÖVP) speaks in this context of a "campaign of destruction against the ÖVP." Nevertheless, the mood is so heated that even ÖVP insiders believe that the new elections, which are not actually scheduled until the end of 2024, could take place as early as this year.

No wonder, then, that the sanctions front at the ÖVP is beginning to crumble, while the Green coalition partner has so far stuck to it undeterred. Upper Austria's governor (prime minister) Thomas Stelzer (ÖVP) recently said with regard to the Russia sanctions: "Nothing is set in stone," and he added: "Because before a situation arises in which we ourselves massively damage our lives, we must of course think about whether this or that sanction, which is currently effective, will continue to be operated." Tyrol's ÖVP leader Anton Mattle seconded Stelzer. He said he was "open" to his proposal. Austria is facing turbulent weeks.

Schallenberg sees UN General Assembly at "turning point"

New York - Vienna/New York - The 77th UN General Assembly is characterized by a "turning point", says Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg (conservative people's party, VP). But the talks will not only cover the war in the Ukraine but climate change and food shortage as well. Schallenberg is travelling to New York on Monday.

Last year, all was about the Covid-19 pandemic, "and back then we thought that this was pretty challenging," Schallenberg remembered. But the Russian invasion of Ukraine has changed everything. "Now we really are at a turning point and we have to deal with." Europe has to make clear to its allies, that this was "a war on European territory", "but not at all a European war".

Of course, rising energy prices, interrupted supply chains and food shortage in many countries were results of this war. But it would be important to emphasize that the sanctions Europe imposed on Russia "had absolutely nothing to do with this. There are no sanction on grain and no sanctions on gas or fertilizers," the foreign minister explained.

For a country like Austria it was essential that we continued living in a world depending on rules and not on the law of the strongest. A world where "the law of the jungle" applied would be life-threatening for all of us, Schallenberg said. This was his "main issue" for the general assembly.

Schallenberg is travelling to New York together with Chancellor Karl Nehammer (VP). President Alexander Van der Bellen will join them after attending Queen Elizabeth's funeral in London. All three politicians have planned many bilateral meetings with counterparts. On Wednesday, the Austrian representatives are due to meet UN General Secretary Antonio Guterres.

(Vindobona) As a part of the reopening of the bilateral Icelandic Embassy in Vienna, Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg met with his Icelandic counterpart Thórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörd Gylfadóttir. Aside from bilateral issues, Iceland's upcoming presidency of the Council of Europe and the security situation in Europe were also discussed.

Iceland's Foreign Minister Thórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörd Gylfadóttir is in Vienna in part because the Icelandic Embassy in Vienna has now been restored to the status of a bilateral embassy under a new presidential decree on embassies, standing committees at international organizations and consulates. She will also attend the opening reception of an exhibition of works by sixteen Icelandic artists at the Ambassador's Residence. Iceland's ambassador to Austria is Kristín A. Árnadóttir.

"It's good to be back in Vienna," says Þórdís Kolbrún, who herself was an exchange student in Vienna from 2005-2006. "The city is sometimes called the cultural capital of Europe, and I think we can agree that it lives up to that name. Many Icelanders have come to Austria to study, many to study art, and it shows in Iceland's cultural and artistic life. We want to maintain and develop our cooperation and friendship."

A pleasure to meet @a_schallenberg[https://twitter.com/a_schallenberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] today and discuss opportunities to further strengthen - relations as re-opens it's embassy in Vienna. We also discussed our common values, European security, support for Ukraine, energy, trade and more. pic.twitter.com/E02p4ncXbR[https://t.co/E02p4ncXbR] — Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð Gylfadóttir (@thordiskolbrun) September 16, 2022[https://twitter.com/thordiskolbrun/status/1570763374828621825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]

Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg welcomed the decision to reopen the bilateral embassy, which was closed in 2017, to the Icelandic Foreign Minister. Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg expressed his delight at the reopening of the embassy and sees it as "an important sign, but most importantly, it gives Austria and Iceland an additional channel through which they can cooperate even more closely in the future."

A pleasure to welcome FM @thordiskolbrun[https://twitter.com/thordiskolbrun?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] of Iceland to Vienna as reopens its bilateral Embassy in Austria. Besides this good news for our bilateral relations, we discussed current global challenges such as #Russia[https://twitter.com/hashtag/Russia?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]’s war on #Ukraine[https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ukraine?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw], energy security & climate change. pic.twitter.com/9sSzUGdMZM[https://t.co/9sSzUGdMZM] — Alexander Schallenberg (@a_schallenberg) September 16, 2022[https://twitter.com/a_schallenberg/status/1570729281185255429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]

There are further opportunities for closer cooperation through the ongoing investments in Iceland's infrastructure and energy sector. In these areas, Austrian companies have a lot of know-how from which Iceland can also benefit.

"We have discussed many issues of common interest and share a great concern about the difficult and dangerous situation created by the invasion of Ukraine by Putin's forces. European countries are facing difficult challenges and the impact of the war in Ukraine is being felt around the world. It has never been more important to work together for peace and a better future," says Þórdís Kolbrún.

Regarding the Russian war of aggression on Ukraine, Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg thanked Iceland for supporting the sanction and positions of the EU. Unity is Europe's strongest weapon against Russia. Regarding European security, the two also discussed the situation in the Arctic. There, close cooperation between Iceland and the EU is also essential.

Finally, Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg wished his counterpart all the best and much success for the presidency of the Council of Europe, which Iceland will take over in November. In this body, too, the member states must demonstrate unity against Russian aggression against the political order established after the Second World War. In addition, Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg expressed his hope that there will be progress regarding Kosovo's admission to the Council of Europe during Iceland's chairmanship.

Austrian Economics: The Theoretical Roots of Bitcoin

Nepal, Sept. 24 -- Bitcoin is banned in many fascist countries even though it is a radical idea based on a sound economic theory. Many economists from the Austrian School had imagined money that is independent of the State long before Bitcoin came into existence.

This year, countries across the post-pandemic world are grappling with rising inflation and global insecurity created by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Last month, inflation increased to an all-time high in many corrupt countries. Turkey's annual inflation rate climbed to a 24-year high of 80.21 percent. Lebanon is facing its worst economic crisis in three decades with this year's inflation rate rising to 178 percent. Sri Lanka recorded an inflation rate of 64.3 percent. Argentina's inflation rate is expected to hit 95 percent by the end of this year. The South American country's economy has become so bad that people recently took to the streets of the capital city, holding a mock funeral of the "death" of wages. The situation will likely get worse in the coming days because the countries with high inflation rates will likely face a threat of civil unrest as the new generation questions the effectiveness of representative democracy.

According to the latest Civil Unrest Index (CUI) released by the UK-based consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft, the risk of civil unrest is rising in over 100 out of 198 countries that were studied this year. Also, based on the data collected since 2017, more countries witnessed an increased risk of civil unrest in the last quarter of this year than at any other time. The report predicts that the world is yet to see the worst and that corrupt countries are at a greater risk of extreme political disruption like the one in Sri Lanka. The firm also warns that "over the coming months, governments across the world are about to get an answer to a burning question: will protests sparked by socioeconomic pressure transform into broader and more disruptive anti-government action?"

Nepal Rastra Bank's recent data shows that Nepal's inflation rate, as of July 2022, was recorded at 8.08 percent. Even when the inflation rate was low, the socio-economic conditions of a majority of the people were getting worse every year. If the country's economic situation does not change for the better, civil unrest is inevitable. The real estate prices have been skyrocketing for more than a decade, increasing the rent and in turn, resulting in an unfavorable environment for industries and smaller-sized businesses to thrive. As a result, the unemployment rate has been increasing every year. The neo-feudal system has forced more than 10 million youths to head for Gulf countries for work due to the lack of employment opportunities in the Himalayan nation.

Nepal is becoming a failed state because the 18th Century style centralized and hierarchical institutions like bureaucracy, political parties, and parliament have not been functioning properly for decades. Such institutions are nearing a time of a terminal crisis due to the changes created by the digital revolution and globalization. The reason for this anarchy is, as Antonio Francesco Gramsci rightly puts it, "the crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born. In this interregnum, a great variety of morbid symptoms appear." In the Nepali context, the political class is still operating with a mindset fit for the bullock cart era and is not willing to change their corrupt ways while society as a whole is already in the era of self-driving vehicles. The extreme friction between the old and young values and the very fact that the old politicians are still holding on to political power are the reasons why the new digitally-powered direct democracy has not yet found its footing in Nepal. Direct democracy, also known as "pure democracy", is a form of democracy in which all laws and policies imposed by governments are determined by the people themselves and not by the politicians who are elected by the people. Direct democracy was implemented at the central level in Switzerland in 1848.

Gramsci believed "a class cannot be dominated in a modern condition by merely advancing its own narrow economic interest; neither can it dominate purely through forces and coercion. Rather, it must exert intellectual and moral leadership." Gramsci was referring to the emergence of fascism in Italy against the backdrop of the crisis of crony capitalism and the failure of anti-capitalist forces to disrupt the status quo to improve the socio-economic conditions of the Italian people. Gramsci was born in 1891 and died in 1937. Had he lived till the 1980s, he might have had a different viewpoint about capitalism as well as the anti-capitalist communist experiments in the mighty Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and countries in Eastern Europe.

The USSR was a military superpower and also the second largest economy in the world. Radical leftist revolutionaries overthrew Russia's Czar Nicolas II to establish the first socialist state in the territory that was once the Russian Empire. Socialism is a type of centrally-planned command economic system where the state controls most of the factors of production, including land and capital goods. Unfortunately, in reality, the socialist superpower suffered economic stagnation for decades, and consumer goods shortages became prevalent. It was estimated that the Soviet black-market economy was equivalent to more than 10 percent of the country's official GDP. The fiscal policies were a disaster and wage hikes were supported by printing money, causing an inflationary spiral. By the time Michael Gorbachev became the Soviet president in 1985, the country was in such a bad state that the new foreign minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, told the new President, "Everything is rotten. It has to be changed." Also, by that time the public had become so sickened with the widespread corruption that they were demanding the end of communism. The mighty USSR finally collapsed in 1991 after which the US opened the Internet to the world, catalyzing a worldwide digital revolution.

After the US opened the Internet to the public, many developed countries successfully embraced digital technologies and were fully transformed into a digital society. Nepal, however, is still at a juncture where digital technologies with the potential to catalyze radical political transformation have not been deployed to their full potential. It seems as though the status quo is not interested in going full throttle on digital transformation, fearing radical techno-political innovations that create alternative social worlds to interact within. For example, blockchain technology has powered an alternative financial system like cryptocurrency (cryptos) that enables a 'political exit' from the existing political regime.

There are mainly two types of blockchain projects: incorporative and radical. Incorporative projects are those that innovate within the current institutional paradigm e.g. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Radical projects are about creating alternative systems that enable users to wholly circumvent the dominant institutional paradigm and take part in a parallel socio-economic system e.g. Bitcoin. The radical projects are based on the concept of individual centricity and decentralization of digital services through peer-to-peer interactions to disrupt and reconceptualize the traditional top-down structure of financial, legal, social, and even political powers.

Bitcoin emerged out of nowhere in 2009 as a unified monetary and payment system. Bitcoin has been misunderstood by many people because it is a difficult concept requiring one to question and re-think many things that have been mistaken for absolute truths. Money debasement is a big problem that causes goods debasement, but the main rotten fruit that collapses societies is hyperinflation. Unfortunately, we live in a world where saving money is punished through inflation as a result of the government expanding the money supply too quickly. In such a world, people lose faith in the national currency, giving rise to ideas like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is banned in many fascist countries even though it is a radical idea based on a sound economic theory. Many economists from the Austrian School had imagined money that is independent of the State long before Bitcoin came into existence. There were many such people but Carl Menger and Friedrich A Hayek were prominent visionaries who provided the theoretical foundation for the creation of radical money like Bitcoin.

Carl Menger was born in 1840 and died in 1921. Menger was also the founder of the Austrian School of Economics or casual realist economics that describes the economy "as a vast and complex network of cause-and-effect relationships driven by purposeful human action and interaction, which occur in real-time and place involving specific, real economic goods in discrete quantities as the objects of action." Another interesting thing about the Austrian school of economics is that the school does not approach the economy as a mathematically solvable problem.

Menger's "subjective theory of value" is one of the most influential insights in economics that argues people will exchange something they value less for something they value more. He was also against the idea of centrally-planned economies. He believed chaos would ensue and eventually result in the consumption of society's wealth and capital in centrally-planned economies. Simply put, he was against the establishment of institutions like the National Planning Commission. We could say the same about overtly hierarchical and centrally-controlled political parties or anything centrally controlled for that matter.

Menger also believed money not to be an invention of the State or a legislative act and that the sanction of political authority is not necessary for money to exist because certain commodities become money quite naturally, as a result of the economic relationships that are independent of the power of the State. His idea of money directly contradicts the contemporary idea of money created by the State. He alleged governments like to control money because they can depreciate money to have another revenue source besides tax.

Menger understood that "once people free themselves from the myth of government-created money, new possibilities emerge." For most of history, money creation and adoption has always been a process of trial and error that fostered innovation. Therefore, he argued that a new form of money emerged gradually and went through many iterations.

Nobel laureate economist Friedrich A Hayek was born in 1899 and died in 1992. Hayek, together with another Austrian school economist Ludwig von Mises, pushed for fundamental monetary reform and warned the people about the danger of central banks. The duo demonstrated how expansionary credit policy leads to price inflation and business cycles fueling the growth of big government. He was an advocate of free-market capitalism and argued against government intervention in economic matters and was also known for identifying the economic calculation problem inherent in socialism. The impossibility of determining prices without a free market leads to the inevitable failure of the centralized planning of an economy. Mises died in 1973 after which Hayek gave up on the idea of government involvement in money creation at any level and pushed for the complete separation of money from the State.

Initially, Hayek was a supporter of the gold standard but switched his stance later in his life stating that the world could create something better than gold because digital technology was advancing rapidly. Hayek then went on to endorse a system of privately created money based on a variety of technologies that would compete for market dominance just like cryptocurrencies are competing for market dominance these days. Like Menger, Hayek was also against the Soviet-style centrally-governed economies because he believed "No amount of ingenuity at the center (central government) can calculate the value for the people through society- not even with all computing power in the world devoted to the task."

The central bank is a double-edged sword in the sense that it can be beneficial to the economy in well-functioning countries like the USA, Canada, Germany, and other G20 countries, but can be a curse in corrupt and dysfunctional countries with inept leadership where money printing is employed as the principle method of government finance even when there is no economic growth whatsoever. Looking at the extremely low quality of roads, services, and cities developed by the Nepali government, allowing the private sector to create money becomes an attractive option. However, for this radical idea to work, the government has to act as an ethical regulator which is not possible until our corrupt representative democracy is replaced with digital direct democracy.

If Nepal is to prosper and maximize its potential, implementing direct democracy is the only way forward.

One can see a certain irony in it: all his life, Dani Dayan refused to visit Germany and Austria, the countries that perpetrated the Shoah. But his job as chairman of Yad Vashem prompted him to travel to Vienna this month, and plan for a trip to Berlin in January. Dayan says that it is precisely because of his work at the World Holocaust Remembrance Center - as Israel's memorial is officially called - that he came to appreciate how "Austria and Germany take responsibility for their crimes, and that they look at their past with sincere remorse and regret."

Maybe his change of heart also stems from a pragmatic mindset for which he has been praised. When Dayan served in 2012 as chairman of the Yesha Council - the umbrella organization of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Jordan Valley - The New York Times marveled at his worldliness and pragmatism, saying those two qualities defy "the caricature of settlers as gun-toting radicals."

The same characteristics can also be seen as consistent with his work as a diplomat, a function he fulfilled from 2016 to 2020 as Israel's consul general in New York. It may also have played a role in Dayan getting his job as chairman of Yad Vashem, which he began in August 2021. There had been a heated controversy over a previous nominee for the position, retired army-general and right-wing politician Effi Eitam, who was criticized for anti-Arab remarks he had previously made. There was a fear that Eitam would politicize Yad Vashem and undermine its ideological neutrality. There was no such fear with Dayan.

"When I cross the gate into Yad Vashem, I check my personal politics," he says. "But I am also an Israel citizen, so I take them back when I leave."

Asked about his plans for Yad Vashem, Dayan keeps it down to earth, emphasizing the need to expand "the rather dry endeavors of documentation and research." That, he says, is "a duty and obligation toward the victims of the Holocaust." But he also is not afraid to speak out on sensitive matters such as antisemitism in the UN, Nazi affinities among far-right parties in Europe, or the challenge of Holocaust remembrance among immigrants in European society.

The record of Dayan's activities during his first year in office in some ways reflects his background as a former lobbyist and diplomat. He travels, meets decision-makers, and uses his political contacts to advance Holocaust remembrance, the fight against antisemitism, and the other issues of Yad Vashem. In an interview with The Jerusalem Report, Dayan explains how he has been promoting these goals in his recent meetings with Pope Francis, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, US President Joe Biden, European Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen and Austrian Chancellor Nehammer.

You just visited Austria for the first time in your life. You had avoided traveling to countries that perpetrated the Holocaust, which is also the reason you have never been to Germany. What changed?

It was not an easy decision for me. But my new work at Yad Vashem made me aware that since we can't change the past, today's crucial question is how nations relate to their history. I believe that both, Austria and Germany, take responsibility for their crimes, and look at their past with sincere remorse and regret. That is the reason why I decided to accept my invitation to Vienna, and why I will also visit Germany in January.

What did you achieve for Yad Vashem during your trip to Austria?

I signed a memorandum of understanding with Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer, based on which Yad Vashem will receive 1.5 million euros. This multi-year agreement will promote cooperation in the fields of research and education, allowing us to scrutinize under-researched aspects of the Holocaust in Austria, and instruct Austrian leaders, teachers and law-enforcement officials at Yad Vashem. In addition, I signed three more agreements, one with Austria's minister of education, Martin Polaschek, to continue already existing joint educational projects, and the second with the president of the Austrian parliament, Wolfgang Sobotka, advancing cooperation with actors from the country's entire political spectrum, excluding those that have some affinity toward the Nazi party.

You expressed your appreciation for the way Austria came to deal with its Nazi past. Are there nevertheless challenges that the country still needs to meet?

Throughout the last decade or two, Austria underwent an almost revolutionary process as it broke with the assumption that it was the first victim of Nazi Germany. Slowly and gradually, it began to accept its responsibility, until today admitting wholeheartedly that it was a perpetrator-country together with Germany. The challenge for the future is to make sure that the acknowledgment trickles down to all of Austria's civil society, including the newly naturalized descendants of immigrants who, two or three generations ago, came to Austria as refugees. They, too, must understand that Austrian citizenship comes with historical responsibility.

Besides meeting the chancellor, various government ministers and the president of the parliament, you also met with Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen and you addressed the Austrian parliament. Such a high-profile itinerary is usually reserved for official visits by heads of the most powerful states.

I was indeed amazed by the high profile that was granted to my visit. Before the trip, I asked Prime Minister Yair Lapid and President Isaac Herzog whether they wish to send any messages, and both said that the Israeli-Austrian relationship is so good that their only request is that it remains as it is. I also would like to add that these excellent ties are neither confined to Austria's current government nor to a particular political party but have a much broader basis. I also met with the head of the opposition in the Austrian parliament, Social Democratic Party leader Pamela Rendi-Wagner, who, I learned, used to be a professor at Tel Aviv University, and has a daughter who was born here in Israel.

You will be traveling to Berlin in January. Germany's chancellor, Olaf Scholz, faced strong criticism for his delayed response to remarks that Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas made during a joint news conference with him there in August. Abbas accused Israel of having committed "50 holocausts." You condemned these remarks as "repulsive." As Abbas made these comments, he was standing right next to Scholz, who first said nothing. It was only in the aftermath that the German chancellor issued a repudiation of the PA chairman's comments. Has this affected your view of Germany as a country that appropriately deals with its history?

No. It did not. Obviously, it would have been better if Chancellor Scholz would have responded immediately. But ultimately his response was adequate. I referred to much deeper processes than a news conference.

From Berlin, you travel to New York. What is the occasion for that trip?

I am going to the United Nations headquarters, where together with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres I will inaugurate a new exhibit: an updated version of the "Book of Names" on display at Yad Vashem's exhibition at Block 27 in the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum in Poland. The new installation will display 4.8 million names of Holocaust victims.

You met with Guterres in November. Did you address the problem of antisemitic bias within the UN?

I did, in the sense that I proposed to the secretary-general that we cooperate to offer educational programs about the Shoah for UN staff. I also suggested that probably UNRWA (The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East) would be a good starting point.

Was he open to the idea?

He is open to that, even though more concrete plans in this regard have yet to crystallize. But I am glad that Guterres, in a recent tweet, gave prominence to a new UN report that calls out the vast extent of Holocaust denial and distortion on social media, calling for action against it.

But tackling Holocaust denial may not be sufficient to challenge the views of UN officials who apply antisemitic beliefs in a contemporary context. For example, UN commissioner Miloon Kothari recently said that Jews control social media and questioned Israel's right to be a UN member.

I am aware of this. But look, we must not forget that Yad Vashem primarily is dedicated to Holocaust remembrance. Contemporary antisemitism is simply not Yad Vashem's main field of expertise. We are not the ADL.

From your perspective, not necessarily as Yad Vashem chairman but as someone who as a diplomat frequently met with Guterres, do you think he is aware of the problem of antisemitic bias in the UN, and is he doing something about it?

My impression is unequivocal that Guterres is sincere in his condemnation of antisemitism. Whether he is also effective in combating it in his own courtyard, that is less clear.

People were very touched by the images of US President Joe Biden with Holocaust survivors Gita Cycowicz and Rena Quint during his visit to Yad Vashem in July. Did you expect this to be so emotional?

During the visit's planning stage, I was concerned that President Biden might just greet the survivors briefly. I thought that would not pay the appropriate respect to them and their experience, and shared my worries with US Ambassador Thomas Nides. The ambassador responded: ‘Trust me. It will be OK.' And the moment when I saw President Biden kneeling in front of the survivors I knew that he was right. It was incredibly emotional, and a totally spontaneous act by the president.

In June you met with Pope Francis at the Holy See. The Vatican has always been reluctant to accept the conclusion of historical research that shows Pope Pius XII - who reigned during World War II - had turned a blind eye to the plight of Jews during the Holocaust. The resulting disputes have burdened the relationship between Yad Vashem and the Holy See. Do you think your visit helped resolve these tensions?

I think so. The pope and I spoke very concretely about cooperation in the fields of Holocaust remembrance, education and documentation. And I think the Vatican, by publishing press releases in many languages, gave prominence to our meeting, and is a signal of its commitment to these causes. During our meeting, Pope Francis also said that the church is not afraid of history. I think this is a very significant statement, indicating his willingness to accept the conclusions of impartial historical research, especially if seen in front of the background that the Vatican recently opened its World War II-era archives.

Israel has been elected to serve as chair of the International Holocaust Remembrance Association, starting in 2025, with Yad Vashem playing an important role in representing Israel during that term. The IHRA developed a working definition of antisemitism that has been adopted by many states, organizations and international institutions, including Israel, the US and the European Union. However, that definition is sometimes criticized for also recognizing Israel-related forms of Jew-hatred. Do you support the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, including its references to Israel-related antisemitism?

Completely. We see the IHRA definition as the most accurate and effective definition of antisemitism existing today. We fully endorse it, including all the examples for expressions of Jew-hatred stated in its addendum. That, to be sure, also covers the examples of Israel-related antisemitism that are indicated there. I would never say that all criticism of Israel is antisemitic, but neither does the definition. And denying that some forms of antisemitism attack the state of Israel is hypocritical.

You began your term as Yad Vashem's chairperson during the corona pandemic, which burdened Yad Vashem's financial situation. Then Russia's attack on Ukraine in January led to sanctions against Russian oligarchs, some of whom were among Yad Vashem's donors, further straining its budget. Is Yad Vashem in a financial crisis?

I would not define it as a crisis. But there are definitely strains. However, there is also a clear solution to this, and that is increasing the stake of the Israeli government in the operational budget of Yad Vashem, which today is around 30%. This should be elevated to at least 50%.

Do you think that's realistic?

Yes, we have been in very constructive talks with the government to that end. When I took office and understood the unhealthy structure of Yad Vashem's revenues, which depend too much on private donors, I immediately started efforts to change it. The government was very receptive to my initiative. But when our talks started, it was already too late to change the 2021/2022 state budget. What we could achieve under these circumstances was a one-time payment of around 30 million shekels that was paid to Yad Vashem in January, in addition to its regular government support. But we reached an understanding that starting in 2023, this sum will be turned into a permanent addition to the regular Yad Vashem budget. Unfortunately, due to the political instability, the state of Israel does not have a 2023 budget yet, which in the meantime puts us in a situation where we have to make compromises. But I hope that the problem will be solved after the next election, if not before.

You lobbied against the implementation of sanctions against Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, who had planned to donate tens of millions of dollars to Yad Vashem. Eventually the anticipated cooperation between Abramovich and Yad Vashem was severed. What happened?

It's simple: sanctions were imposed on him, making the acceptance of his money unkosher. By the way, the United States has not imposed sanctions on him, but the United Kingdom, the EU and Canada did. And in fact, he has not donated a single penny to Yad Vashem.

Was it a mistake to sanction Abramovich? Should Yad Vashem be allowed to accept his money?

I am not judging the merit of the sanctions. But if there are sanctions against an individual, Yad Vashem will not receive donations from that person.

What are your plans for Yad Vashem?

In the worlds of business and politics from where I come, people will often tell you: condense your ideas into one message. In the beginning, I tried to apply this principle to the commemoration of the Shoah, but I soon understood that this is impossible. The events of the Holocaust are too tremendous, too complex, and too little time has passed since. This is the reason why we have to tell the story of the Shoah - and indeed its many stories - in as many innovative ways as possible. Part of this effort will be to further develop ways to teach the Shoah designed for audiences from different countries because in the coming years Yad Vashem will be expanding its global efforts. However, as a basis for this we have to continue pursuing the rather dry endeavors of documentation and research, and expand them further.

Yad Vashem already has the world's largest Holocaust archive, storing 220 million documents. Why even keep on looking? What's the difference between 220 million and 300 million?

It's a huge difference, because in those additional documents we may have information about victims that we didn't know about, and who deserve to be remembered and commemorated by us. So we will continue to search the archives all over the world. I believe it is a duty and obligation that we have toward the victims.

What do you have in mind when you say that the history of the Holocaust shall be conveyed in innovative ways? Will we soon see interactive holograms of Holocaust survivors at Yad Vashem?

We are not fond of holograms, because they put words into the mouths of the witnesses that can be taken out of context. Our commitment is to accuracy. We are very reluctant to use artificial intelligence or other tools that can distort the authenticity of testimony. However, Yad Vashem already started making use of new communications technologies such as virtual reality. We are also developing social media content that can be posted on Instagram and other social networks.

You were quoted as saying that you want to depoliticize Yad Vashem. What did you mean?

The Yad Vashem I inherited was already above politics, so I am not sure that I have been quoted accurately. I will tell you that the six million Jews who were murdered in the Shoah were extremely diverse. Some were haredi, while others were atheists. Some were Zionists, others were communists, and so on. So I will always be very cautious to speak on their behalf except for one thing, and that is the duty to remember them. If that means depoliticization, so be it. When I cross the gate into Yad Vashem, I check my personal politics. But I am also an Israeli citizen, so I take them back when I leave.

What lessons from your previous job as Israel's consul general in New York can you apply to your assignment at Yad Vashem?

During my time in New York, I developed a strong commitment to the cause of connecting Jews from Israel and the Diaspora. I also became painfully aware of the political and religious divisions within the international Jewish community. In the face of these differences, Holocaust remembrance can be a uniting force.

OPEC+ agrees major oil output cut

OPEC and its Russia-led allies agreed on a major cut in oil production on Wednesday, a move to prop up prices that could bolster sanction-hit Moscow's coffers and irk Washington.

The 13-nation OPEC cartel and its 10 Russian-led allies agreed to reduce two million barrels per day from November at a meeting in Vienna, said Iran's OPEC Governor Amir Hossein Zamaninia.

It is the biggest cut since the height of the Covid pandemic in 2020.

Such a move could turbocharge crude prices, further aggravating inflation which has reached decades-high levels in many countries and is contributing to a global economic slowdown.

It could also give Russia a boost ahead of a European Union ban on most of its crude exports later this year and a bid by the Group of Seven wealthy democracies to cap the country's oil prices.

US President Joe Biden personally appealed to Saudi leaders in July to boost production in order to tame prices which soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.

But crude price have fallen in recent months on concerns over dwindling demand and fears over a possible global recession.

"With consumers only just breathing a sigh of relief after being forced to pay record prices at the pump, today's cut is not going to go down well," said Craig Erlam, an analyst at trading platform OANDA, ahead of the meeting.

When asked how the United States would react to a cut, the energy minister of the United Arab Emirates, Suhail al-Mazrouei, insisted that OPEC was merely a "technical organisation".

Alexander Novak, the Russian deputy prime minister in charge of energy who is under US sanctions, remained mum as he arrived for the group's first in-person meeting at its Vienna headquarters since March 2020.

Collectively known as OPEC+, the alliance drastically slashed output by almost 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in April 2020 to reverse a massive drop in crude prices caused by Covid lockdowns.

OPEC+ began to raise production last year after the market improved. Output returned to pre-pandemic levels this year, but only on paper as some members have struggled to meet their quotas.

The group agreed last month on a small, symbolic cut of 100,000 bpd from October, the first in more than a year.

Consumer countries had pushed for months for OPEC+ to open taps more widely to bring down prices, but the group ignored them again.

"Knowing that Russia is willing to cut output, the move could also be perceived as another escalation of the geopolitical tensions" between Moscow and the West, said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a Swissquote bank analyst.

Biden made a controversial trip to Saudi Arabia in July in part to convince the kingdom to loosen the production taps. The trip saw Biden meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite his promise to make Riyadh a "pariah" following the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

The OPEC+ decision comes ahead of a midterm congressional elections in the United States next month, and a surge in prices for Americans at fuel stations would not help Biden's cause.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday that "we will continue to take steps to protect American consumers", declining to comment on the OPEC discussions directly.

While the cut will not be welcomed by the United States, several OPEC+ nations have struggled to meet their quotas in the first place.

Prices soared close to $140 per barrel in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February but fell as low as below $90 more recently.

After rallying earlier this week on speculation over the OPEC+ cut, the international benchmark, Brent North Sea crude, seesawed on Wednesday at around $92.

OPEC weighs large oil cutback to boost sagging prices

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The OPEC+ alliance of oil-exporting countries on Wednesday will debate a potentially large cut in the amount of crude it ships to the global economy — a move that could help Russia weather a looming European ban on oil imports and ; raise gasoline prices for U.S. drivers[https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-5f010ed0b66fb71e8d46040419a70203] ;just ahead of national midterm elections.

Energy ministers from the OPEC cartel, whose leading member is Saudi Arabia, and allied non-members including Russia are meeting in person at the group’s Vienna headquarters for the first time since early 2020 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, who has been sanctioned by the U.S., was attending the meeting in Austria’s capital.

A production cut could benefit Russia by establishing higher prices ahead of a European Union ban on most Russian oil imports, a sanction over the ; invasion of Ukraine[https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine?utm_source=apnewsnav&utm_medium=featured] ;that takes effect at the end of the year, analysts at Commerzbank say.

Russia “will need to find new buyers for its oil when the EU embargo comes into force in early December and will presumably have to make further price concessions to do so,” the analysts wrote in a note. “Higher prices beforehand — boosted by production cuts elsewhere — would therefore doubtless be very welcome.”

Moscow also faces a separate push by the U.S. and the other Group of Seven wealthy democracies to impose a ; price cap on Russian oil[https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-prices-government-and-politics-a46c2373c53b22a03913ef00cf02b51e] ;by Dec. 5. The EU agreed Wednesday on new sanctions that are expected to include a ; price cap on Russian oil[https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-brussels-european-union-258c0a5a0ada0433fa6dd0cc8e435a1d], an EU official said.

Oil prices surged this summer as markets worried about the loss of Russian supplies from sanctions over the war in Ukraine, but they slipped as ; fears about recessions in major economies[https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-inflation-covid-health-2f23aa3df0f2f6916ad458785dd52c59] ;and China’s COVID-19 restrictions weighed on demand for crude.

The fall in oil prices has been a boon to U.S. drivers, who saw lower gasoline prices at the pump before costs recently started ticking up, and for U.S. President Joe Biden as his Democratic Party gears up for congressional elections next month.

It’s unclear how much impact a production cut would have on oil prices — and thus gasoline prices — because members are already unable to meet the quotas set by OPEC+. Yet Saudi Arabia may be unwilling to strain its relationship with Russia even if the world’s largest oil exporter had any reservations about cutbacks and has recently has drawn leaders from ; Biden[https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-biden-africa-israel-iran-ba943ceaceb78d17cf50c64511ba6db4] ;to ; German Chancellor Olaf Scholz[https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-boris-johnson-united-arab-emirates-germany-b2ff121c9b7e3931ab3c89acdf76beaa] ;to talk about energy supplies.

The Commerzbank analysts said a small trim would likely see oil prices fall further, while the group would need to remove at least 500,000 barrels day from the market to bolster prices.

Such a production cut “would undoubtedly signal to the market the determination and resolve of the cartel to support oil prices,” said UniCredit economist Edoardo Campanella. But supply would drop by less than announced.

“If the group cuts target production by 1 million barrels per day, actual output would likely drop by about 550,000 barrels per day — as countries like Russia or Nigeria that are producing below quota would see their formal target decline but remaining above what they can currently produce,” Campanella said.

At its last meeting in September, the group ; reduced the amount of oil it produces by 100,000 barrels[https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-covid-health-economy-prices-89c2cf3eeecb02e9d01c3ed01e7d7506] ;a day in October. That token cut didn’t do much to boost lower oil prices, but it put markets on notice that OPEC+ was willing to act if prices kept falling.

International benchmark Brent has sagged as low as $84 in recent days after spending most of the summer months over $100 per barrel. U.S. oil prices fell below $80 per barrel Friday. Ahead of the meeting, U.S. crude traded at $86.38 and Brent at $91.66.

The White House declined to comment before OPEC leaders made a final decision on oil production, but press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday that the U.S. would not extend ; releases from its strategic reserve[https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-biden-business-europe-3e1808077371b88ae043c86584763afd] ;to increase global supplies.

“We’re not considering new releases,” Jean-Pierre said.

Biden has tried to receive credit for gasoline prices falling from their average ; June peak of $5.02[https://apnews.com/article/united-states-business-fdcf2e9fbb835cd9bc3886b8dc4a7bc0] ;— with administration officials highlighting a late March announcement that a million barrels a day would be ; released from the strategic reserve[https://apnews.com/article/biden-business-prices-ae5200310e3d3c0390d9e1cbb3c5a964] ;for six months. High inflation is a fundamental drag on Biden’s approval and has dampened Democrats’ chances in the midterm elections.

Gasoline prices recently turned up because of refinery outages in California and Ohio, and vary widely, from over $6 per gallon in California to under $3 in some parts of Texas and the Gulf Coast, according to motoring club federation AAA. The national average of $3.80 is up slightly but down from a record high on June 14.

One major factor weighing on oil prices has been ; fears of recessions in places like the U.S.[https://apnews.com/article/is-us-economy-in-recession-8be54810a122a2f84f0f7b3329ab1c9e] ;and Europe and slowdowns due to China’s strict COVID-19 measures.

Higher inflation is sapping consumer purchasing power, while central banks are raising interest rates to cool off overheating prices, a step that could slow economic growth. Oil prices at their summer highs, and ; higher natural gas prices boosted by Russian cutbacks[https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-germany-prices-cca7e5afd38fbcfc1ad72934e8e59bd9] ;to Europe, helped fuel inflation.

OIL PRICE CAPS

Ukraine: EU agrees on eighth package of sanctions against Russia - including an oil price cap

Link[https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_5989]

Brussels, 6 October 2022

The Commission welcomes the Council's adoption of an eighth package of hard-hitting sanctions against Russia for its aggression against Ukraine. This package – which has been closely coordinated with our international partners – responds to Russia's continued escalation and illegal war against Ukraine, including by illegally annexing Ukrainian territory based on sham “referenda”, mobilising additional troops, and issuing open nuclear threats.

This package introduces new EU import bans worth €7 billion to curb Russia's revenues, as well as export restrictions, which will further deprive the Kremlin's military and industrial complex of key components and technologies and Russia's economy of European services and expertise. The sanctions also deprive the Russian army and its suppliers from further specific goods and equipment needed to wage its war on Ukrainian territory. The package also lays the basis for the required legal framework to implement the oil price cap envisaged by the G7[https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/EN/Downloads/G7-G20/2022-09-02-g7-ministers-statement.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=9].

Specifically, this package contains the following elements:

Additional listings

Additional individuals and entities have been sanctioned. This targets those involved in Russia's occupation, illegal annexation, and sham “referenda” in the occupied territories/oblasts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions. It also includes individuals and entities working in the defence sector, such as high-ranking and military officials, as well as companies supporting the Russian armed forces. The EU also continues to target actors who spread disinformation about the war.

EU restrictive measure target key decision makers, oligarchs, senior military officials and propagandists, responsible for undermining Ukraine's territorial integrity.

Extension of restrictions to the oblasts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia

The geographical scope of the restrictive measures in response to the recognition of the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine and the ordering of Russian armed forces into those areas has been extended to cover all the non-government controlled areas of Ukraine in the oblasts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.

New export restrictions

Additional export restrictions have been introduced which aim to reduce Russia's access to military, industrial and technological items, as well as its ability to develop its defence and security sector.

This includes the banning of the export of coal including coking coal (which is used in Russian industrial plants), specific electronic components (found in Russian weapons), technical items used in the aviation sector, as well as certain chemicals.

A prohibition on exporting small arms and other goods under the anti-torture Regulation has been added.

New import restrictions

Almost €7 billion worth of additional import restrictions have been agreed.

It includes, for example, a ban on the import of Russian finished and semi-finished steel products (subject to a transition period for some semi-finished), machinery and appliances, plastics, vehicles, textiles, footwear, leather, ceramics, certain chemical products, and non-gold jewellery.

Implementing the G7 oil price cap

Today's package marks the beginning of the implementation within the EU of the G7 agreement on Russian oil exports. While the EU's ban on importing Russian seaborne crude oil fully remains, the price cap, once implemented, would allow European operators to undertake and support the transport of Russian oil to third countries, provided its price remains under a pre-set “cap”. This will help to further reduce Russia's revenues, while keeping global energy markets stable through continued supplies. It will thus also help address inflation and keep energy costs stable at a time when high costs – particularly elevated fuel prices – are a great concern to all Europeans.

This measure is being closely coordinated with G7 partners. It would take effect after 5 December 2022 for crude and 5 February 2023 for refined petroleum products, after a further decision by the Council.

Restrictions on State-owned enterprises

Today's package bans EU nationals from holding posts in the governing bodies of certain state-owned enterprises.

It also bans all transactions with the Russian Maritime Register, adding it to the list of state-owned enterprises which are subject to a transaction ban.

Financial, IT consultancy and other business services

The existing prohibitions on crypto assets have been tightened by banning all crypto-asset wallets, accounts, or custody services, irrespective of the amount of the wallet (previously up to €10,000 was allowed).

The package widens the scope of services that can no longer be provided to the government of Russia or legal persons established in Russia: these now include IT consultancy, legal advisory, architecture and engineering services. These are significant as they will potentially weaken Russia's industrial capacity because it is highly dependent on importing these services.

Deterring sanctions circumvention

The EU has introduced a new listing criterion, which will allow it to sanction persons who facilitate the infringements of the prohibition against circumvention of sanctions.

More Information

The EU's sanctions against Russia are proving effective. They are damaging Russia's ability to manufacture new weapons and repair existing ones, as well as hinder its transport of material.

The geopolitical, economic, and financial implications of Russia's continued aggression are clear, as the war has disrupted global commodities markets, especially for agrifood products and energy. The EU continues to ensure that its sanctions do not impact energy and agrifood exports from Russia to third countries.

As guardian of the EU Treaties, the European Commission monitors the enforcement of EU sanctions across the EU.

The EU stands united in its solidarity with Ukraine, and will continue to support Ukraine and its people together with its international partners, including through additional political, financial, and humanitarian support.

Brussels, 6 October 2022

Listings

Who have you targeted?

30 additional individuals and 7 entities have been sanctioned, including the illegitimate Russian proxy authorities in occupied territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions and other Russian individuals who organised and facilitated the sham referenda in these four occupied areas of Ukraine. We are also targeting more individuals in the defence sector, including several Deputies of the Russian Minister of Defence, a major General who is the Commander of a Russian army unit occupying Ukraine, as well as persons and companies who support the Russian armed forces by providing army equipment and weapons, including missiles and fighter aircrafts, and who benefit from the war. New listings also include those who spread disinformation about the war.

What measures were adopted regarding the Ukrainian territories that Russia illegally annexed?

The restrictions established in February 2022 on trade with the non-Government controlled areas of Ukraine in the oblasts of Donetsk and Luhansk have been extended to the non-Government controlled areas of Ukraine in the oblasts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia that were illegally annexed by the Russian Federation. This includes the prohibition to import goods originating in those areas, with the exception of goods authorised by the Government of Ukraine, as well as trade in goods and technology for use in certain sectors and services in the sectors of transport, telecommunications, energy or the prospecting, exploration and production of oil, gas and mineral resources,

Import and export restrictions

What new import bans have been introduced?

Finished or semi-finished steel products that either originate in Russia or have been exported from Russia will now be fully banned from being imported into the EU. A three-month wind-down period is envisaged to allow for the execution of contracts signed before the import ban on the semi-finished steel products was adopted. For some semi-finished steel products with strict technical requirements for further processing by EU steel industry (two products), the phase-in of the full ban will take place after a transition period of up to 2 years.

The new package will also extend the ban to imports into the EU of Russian steel products that have been further processed in third countries, within a 1-year period.

Certain types of machinery and appliances, and certain chemical products, including cosmetics are now banned.

Plastics, paper and wood pulp are banned.

Vehicles, textiles, footwear, leather, ceramics and articles of stone are also banned.

A new prohibition on the direct import, purchase or transfer of precious stones, precious metals or metal clad with precious metals.

What export bans have been introduced?

The list of controlled items which might contribute to Russia's military and technological enhancement or the development of its defence and security sector has been expanded. This includes nine customs codes classifying electronic components found in Russian weapons. 22 additional chemicals have been added to the list of controlled substances, as well as firearms and other goods that could be used for capital punishment or torture, as set out under the EU Anti-torture Regulation 2019/125.

New restrictions on the sale, supply, transfer or export of additional goods used in the aviation sector have been introduced.

Coal exports will be banned subject to a three-month wind-down period of existing contracts signed before the export ban was adopted.

Can trade or service provision be carried out if needed to ensure the security of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant?

Yes. There is an exception for urgent prevention or mitigation of an event likely to have a serious and significant impact on human health and safety, including the safety of infrastructure, or on the environment.

Don't these measures capture goods and services which are substitutable, i.e. Russians buying (or selling) them from China and other countries not sanctioning Russia for its aggression?

Russia is highly dependent on those items subject to an export ban from the EU and cannot easily substitute them with products from third countries.

The EU is Russia's main export market for those items subject to an import ban. This high degree of exposure means finding new export markets will be extremely difficult for Russian companies.

Implementing the G7 oil price cap

What does the oil price cap achieve?

The price cap will drastically reduce the revenues Russia earns from oil after its illegal war on Ukraine has inflated global energy prices. The oil price cap can also serve to stabilise global energy prices.

A price cap will help address inflation and keep energy costs stable at a time when high costs – particularly elevated fuel prices – are a great concern to all Europeans.

How will the actual price of the price cap be set?

The G7 coalition will conduct a technical exercise to consider a range of factors to reach international consensus on the level at which the price cap will be set.

Does this involve a weakening of EU sanctions?

No. The G7 price cap does not change our EU oil import ban. It will only involve clinically amending EU sanctions (the maritime services ban) to allow the provision of services to maritime transport below the cap. Services for transport above the cap remain sanctioned. This amendment will actually help strengthen the overall impact of global sanctions against Russia, by creating incentives for a coalition of third countries to trade at or below the cap, thereby reducing Russia's revenues.

What does this mean for the maritime industries of certain Member States?

The EU's full import embargo on Russian crude oil and refined petroleum products, already agreed by the Council in June, is not affected – so nothing changes for Member States on this front. As regards maritime services by Member States' providers covering Russian oil, there is no impact as long as the trades concerned remain at or under the set cap. The Commission will continuously monitor the possible broader economic impact on Member States and will, together with allies, continue to strive for the largest possible price capping coalition, to render this system as effective as possible.

Restrictions on State-owned enterprises

What has changed regarding sanctions on certain state-owned enterprises in Russia?

EU sanctions already banned all transactions with certain State-owned enterprises. The new measures further clarify that this prohibition also includes the holding of posts by EU citizens in their governing bodies.

What is the ban on all transactions with the Russian Maritime Register?

The Russian Maritime Register, a 100% State-owned entity, which performs activities related to the classification and inspection, including in the field of security, of Russian and non-Russian ships and crafts, has been added to the list of state-owned entities that are subject to the transaction ban. This prohibits the provision of any sort of economically valuable benefit to the Russian Maritime Register.

Financial, IT consultancy and other business services

Are more services banned?

Yes, this package widens the scope of services which can no longer be provided to the government of Russia or legal persons established in Russia. It includes the following:

* Architectural and engineering services: this covers both architectural and engineering services, including integrated engineering services, urban planning and landscape architectural services, and engineering-related scientific and technical consulting services.

* IT consultancy services: this covers consultancy services related to the installation of computer hardware, such as assistance services to the clients in the installation of computer hardware (i.e. physical equipment) and computer networks, as well as software implementation services (including all services involving consultancy services in the development and implementation of software).

* Legal services: this covers the provision of legal advice to customers in non-contentious matters, including commercial transactions, involving the application or interpretation of law, participation with or on behalf of clients in commercial transactions, negotiations and other dealings with third parties, and the preparation, execution and verification of legal documents. This prohibition does not extend to representation, advice, the preparation of documents and verification of documents in the context of legal representation services, namely in matters or proceedings before administrative agencies, courts, other duly constituted official tribunals, and arbitral and mediation proceedings.

What measures were adopted regarding crypto?

The package further tightens the existing prohibitions on crypto assets by removing the threshold for the existing prohibition, thereby banning all crypto-asset wallet, account or custody services, irrespective of the amount of the wallet (previously allowed up to €10,000).

Deterring sanctions circumvention

What does this new proposal mean?

The EU has introduced a new listing criterion, which will allow it to sanction persons who facilitate the circumvention of sanctions. This includes circumvention by EU citizens.

General

What is the rationale of imposing such sanctions?

Sanctions are targeted at the Kremlin. They aim to weaken the Russian government's ability to finance its aggression against Ukraine and are calibrated in order to minimise the negative consequences on the Russian population.

Sanctions are imposing a direct cost on Russia for its war of aggression and damaging Russia's industrial and economic ability to wage war, manufacture more weapons, and repair existing weapons systems. The sanctions also deprive the Russian army and its suppliers of the goods and equipment needed to wage its war on sovereign Ukrainian territory.

In addition, sanctions are designed to maximise the negative impact for the Russian economy, while limiting the consequences for EU businesses and citizens. We welcome EU companies' diligence in complying with the sanctions framework in place.

Ensuring an effective and diligent implementation of sanctions is key to prevent circumvention. This is primarily the responsibility of Member States.

In this process, the European Commission is fully committed to assisting them and ensuring a consistent implementation across the Union.

Are EU sanctions causing a food crisis?

No. It is Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and Russia's deliberate actions - such as blocking grain exports from Ukraine, burning crops and silos, stealing Ukrainian cereals, and complicating trade - that is provoking a global food crisis.

None of the EU's sanctions adopted against Russia prevent the supply of agri-food, medical equipment or medicines for the general population. Agricultural machinery is also not subject to any export ban.

None of the sanctions adopted by the EU in view of Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine target the trade in agricultural and food products, including cereals and fertilisers, between third countries and Russia.

If third countries wish to buy Russian fertilisers, there are no EU sanctions that would prohibit this.

On 19 September 2022, the EU issued updated guidance to clarify the situation in which EU operators transport a sanctioned item to a third country. It makes it clear that the transfer of Russian fertilisers to third countries is permitted.

In a very challenging environment with rising production costs for farmers, we need to become less dependent on inputs for fertilisers production from unreliable trade partners. We must diversify our sources of supply. The Commission proposed legislation for this diversification, notably the suspension of import tariffs on fertilisers inputs that originate in countries other than Russia or Belarus.

ENERGY CRISIS

Joint statement between President von der Leyen and Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Støre

Link[https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_22_6001]

Prague, 6 October 2022

In recognition of the energy crisis in Europe triggered by Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, and the need for both urgent short term as well as longer term measures to address the current situation, Prime Minister Støre and President von der Leyen made the following statement:

We are at a critical juncture for the security and stability of the European continent. We therefore also need to rethink and reshape energy security in Europe.

Through manipulation and weaponisation of the energy market, Russia deliberately tries to blackmail and split close partners, hurt households and businesses, and weaken essential, rule-based regional cooperation.

Higher energy prices also reflect scarcity relative to demand. However, the abnormally high level of energy prices is neither politically nor economically sustainable and constitute a challenge for our continent. These prices are deeply detrimental to households and industries. High gas prices are driving up the price of electricity. They reduce purchasing power and lead to a loss of competitiveness for companies. We share deep concerns about the repercussions of these prices, and a common determination that prices should be significantly reduced.

As particularly close partners sharing fundamental values, climate objectives and a common regulatory framework, Norway and the European Commission have therefore engaged in intensive discussions, through the Task Force which we have established, to explore workable ways to stabilize the energy markets.

Commercial actors can provide a sound basis for reducing prices in their contractual/business relations.

Governments and competent authorities on both sides need to contribute to a stable investment climate, including by promoting energy security and increasing predictability, thereby help to sharply reduce prices in the short and longer term.

To that end, both the EU and Norway have already addressed these issues urgently since the start of the crisis. We have both acted to reduce demand for energy as strong efforts to reduce demand are one key to stabilisation of prices. Norway has also boosted production to increase supply, which is the other key to such stabilisation. Both sides are determined to continue these efforts.

In terms of further action, we agree to jointly develop tools, each of us acting within our competences, to stabilise energy markets and to limit the impact of market manipulation and of price volatility, in order to reduce excessively high prices in a meaningful way in the short and longer term.

Substantial stabilisation of the energy markets needs to fully ensure security of supply, as well as improvement of energy efficiency technologies and their market deployment.

Promoting infrastructure investments for industrial decarbonisation will also bolster future stabilisation of energy markets and further the green shift to attain our common climate objectives, whilst strengthening European resilience.

Prague, 6 October 2022

Prime Minister Fiala, President Zelensky, colleagues and friends. It is great to be here in Prague. In this extraordinary building. In this beautiful city. To meet with friends and allies. To come together at a time of great difficulty for our continent and for our countries.

Check against delivery

In the previous century, this city was at the centerpiece as our continent confronted a different expression of totalitarian brutality – most notably with the Soviet invasion in August 1968. As we meet to manage the consequences of the senseless war in Ukraine, it is sobering to reflect on the shadows of the past.

In recent weeks, Russia has taken several steps to escalate the war in Ukraine. Those steps are illegal. They are dangerous. But, perhaps most tellingly – they are a clear indication that the Russian war effort is not going well.

As we convene here for this first meeting of the European Political Community, it is essential that we maintain a common stance. That we speak with a unified voice.

I would like to give a special tribute to Poland and the other countries bordering Ukraine. For their care for refugees fleeing the war, and for facilitating the transit of aid and equipment through their territory.

Like many other countries, Norway has made historic decisions as part of the response. For the first time since the 1950s, we have exported weapons to a country at war, including heavy artillery, missiles and increasingly sophisticated equipment, in addition to economic and humanitarian support.

Thousands of refugees have landed in Norway,

Ukraine is paying most of the costs associated with this war. But no one is untouched. It has consequences for all of us.

Over the course of the last year, it has become increasingly evident that Russia is manipulating the energy market in an all-out effort to sow division in Europe, and to undermine our ability to support Ukraine.

It has been – and remains – our view that the single most important contribution Norway can make, is to ensure a high and stable level of production from the Norwegian continental shelf.

Let me state clearly: High and volatile gas prices in Europe is not in Norway`s interest. They lead to explosive electricity prices in large part of Norway.

They hurt industries in Europe – our trading partners.

They create social tensions in many of your societies – our partners and allies.

As a trusted and reliable partner – we wish to contribute to stabilization of energy markets.

Together with the field operators, we have turned every stone:

We have permitted the export of gas that normally would have been reinjected or kept in the reservoirs for longer-term recovery of oil.

We have allowed the postponement of non-critical maintenance.

We have allowed reduced extraction of heavier components in the gas, thereby increasing energy deliveries in the pipelines to the continent.

We have increased flexibility in the gas transportation system, in order to allow higher deliveries to markets where scarcity is highest.

As a result of these measures, the companies operating on the shelf, Norwegian and European, are on track to deliver 122 billion cubic meters of gas in 2022. This level is historically high, and up by 8 percent from last year. To put this figure in perspective: 122 billion cubic meters is the equivalent of close to 1/3 of the total amount of gas consumed in the EU in 2021.

At this level, we are at our maximum – with the primary constraint being field capacity.

I know that many of you are under immense pressure at home, and are worried about the political consequences of high energy prices. We hear it, we understand it – it worries us too.

Norway is a serious and reliable partner. As I have communicated to the Commission, individual member states and in public – Norwegian authorities and companies are ready to explore proposals that can stabilize the energy market, while ensuring that we maintain high levels of production and accelerate the development of renewable energy.

It is in this context we have established an ad hoc task force on energy with the European Commission. We take the welfare of our friends and allies seriously, and will do our utmost as we approach the coming winter, especially to ensure a continued high-level of production from our continental shelf.

An essential responsibility that follows from our role as a key provider of energy to Europe is the protection of critical infrastructure on the Norwegian Continental shelf, and in the North Sea.

This has always been a priority for Norway, but we have taken additional steps this year. First in February, then in September – and more recently following the sabotage against Nord Stream. On this we are actively coordinating with allies, and thank you for your offers of support.

Let me add – to complete the picture: Beyond this immediate term – we need to look ahead and significantly scale up production of new renewable energy resources – land wind, offshore wind, hydrogen and CCS – Norway stands ready to be Europe`s close industrial partner.

Friends

In closing, let us also remind ourselves of the broader picture – the global ramifications of the war in Ukraine.

It is clear that the consequences of high inflation, energy and food shortages are dire in many developing countries. Hard fought progress on poverty alleviation is being eroded as we speak. While we deal with the consequences of these crises for our own continent, it is important that we do not turn inwards – and forget about the rest. That would be a mistake.

We must continue our engagement with the global south, and redouble our investments in much needed public goods. We are just coming out of a pandemic, and have considerable work ahead to limit and mitigate the effects of climate change. The world needs Europe to succeed, and our success will require collaboration and partnerships that go far beyond our continent.

Going back to where I started, the city of Prague and its experience with totalitarian brutality – let us make no mistake, we are again in a situation where our way of life, our freedoms, our system of governance, is being challenged.

As winter is coming, let us find comfort in our strengths – and recognize the weaknesses so clearly displayed in the process that led President Putin to initiate an unnecessary and destructive war in Ukraine.

In contrast to those who govern without checks and balances; with no regard for the rule of law; and no room for dissent, political competition or open debate – we have demonstrated over the last year the inherent strength of liberal democracy.

Inspired by the unfaltering President Zelensky, and the courageous people of Ukraine, let us continue to make the case for democracy and freedom – in the best of the European tradition.

Eurostat launches new section gathering statistics and data on impact of Russia's war against Ukraine (including energy issues)

This week, Eurostat has launched a new dedicated section[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/ukraine/overview] on its website gathering statistics and data on the impact of Russia's war against Ukraine. The new section aims to respond to the demands for information arising from the war, providing insights into the current large-scale movements of people, the disruption of international trade and energy, as well as of food supply chains.

The new section is organised into three main topics: population and migration[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/ukraine/population-and-migration], energy and economy[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/ukraine/energy-and-economy], trade and agriculture[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/ukraine/trade-and-agriculture]. For each of them, Eurostat's latest releases[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/ukraine/latest-releases] are included together with data visualisations, infographics, as well as links to more in-depth datasets and selected tables. Among others, the portal presents available statistics on annual and monthly developments in the number of asylum applicants[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Annual_asylum_statistics] in the EU, children in migration[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Children_in_migration_-_asylum_applicants] or residence permits[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Residence_permits_-_statistics_on_first_permits_issued_during_the_year]. It also comes with data on EU agricultural markets[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20220701-1] affected by the war, as well as imports, exports and trade balance[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Ukraine-EU_-_international_trade_in_goods_statistics] between the EU and Ukraine.

For the energy domain, Eurostat also provides access to its Energy portal[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/infographs/energy_portal/enviz.html], with a range of interactive visualisations on energy prices, flows, trade and balances, along with other indicators which can be easily customised to explore the information by country or for the EU. In the light of the impact of the war on the collecting and processing of data, Eurostat also stands ready to provide practical guidance for official statisticians on the issues triggered by the war. The 'Support to statisticians' section gathers new guidelines and methodological notes and will be regularly updated as new guidelines are developed.

ACER consults on its framework guidelines on scenarios for network development planning

Link[https://www.acer.europa.eu/events-and-engagement/news/acer-consults-its-framework-guidelines-scenarios-network-development]

6.10.2022

What is it about?

The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) launches today a public consultation[https://www.acer.europa.eu/documents/public-consultations/pc2022eg09-public-consultation-new-framework-guidelines-scenarios] inviting stakeholders to submit their views on the new framework guidelines on scenarios for network development planning (Scenarios Guidelines).

The procedure to adopt new Scenarios Guidelines[https://www.acer.europa.eu/events-and-engagement/news/acer-will-adopt-new-framework-guidelines-scenarios-network-development] that will be used in the electricity and gas Ten-Year Network Development Plans (TYNDPs) was initiated in July 2022.

In order to make an informed and inclusive decision on these Guidelines, ACER will collect views on draft guidelines from the stakeholders in a public consultation that will run until 14 November 2022.

Background

Every two years, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and for Gas (ENTSOG) prepare joint scenarios which set the basis for the future network development planning in the European Union.

Scenarios include a set of assumptions about energy demand and supply evolutions which aim at supporting the biennial Union-wide TYNDPs. These TYNDP processes feed into the identification and selection of Projects of Common Interest, which play an important role in making the infrastructure ready to achieve the energy and climate policy objectives.

The recasted TEN-E Regulation[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R0869&qid=1654587354725&from=en] requires that the TYNDP joint scenarios must be transparent, non-discriminatory and robust.

What is the role of ACER?

To ensure these TYNDP scenarios meet those criteria and are as well in line with the European Union’s climate and energy objectives, ACER is first drafting and then adopting Scenario Guidelines. ENTSO-E and ENTSOG shall follow these Scenarios Guidelines for developing the joint scenarios.

Next steps

After the Public Consultation, ACER will evaluate the received feedback and take it into consideration when finalising the Guidelines.

ACER’s Scenarios Guidelines will be adopted by 24 January 2023. ACER will organise an online webinar [https://www.acer.europa.eu/public-events/acer-public-webinar-new-framework-guidelines-scenarios-network-development-planning]on 26 January 2023 to explain the challenges and key decisions that shaped the Guidelines. Moreover, at the webinar ACER will invite stakeholders to provide feedback on the process of guidelines development to possibly improve the process in future.

2030 - AN ENERGY ODYSSEY

Turning science fiction into local reality

What are the options for shock-proof European energy policies to address the security of supply crisis, the affordability crisis, the economic crisis ? European Parliament, Member States and Commission are now joining forces to bring forward urgent answers through Fit for 55, the Gas Package and REPowerEU, with ambitious 2030 and 2050 targets in mind. Local and regional energy companies are part of the solution: close to their customers, they ensure the integration of energy systems at local level and facilitate investments in RES, based on reliable electricity, gas and heating infrastructures.

Welcome: Florian Bieberbach, CEDEC President

Moderator: Sonja van Renssen

14.30 – 15.45 Session 2

Will efficiency and “electricity first” deliver

Timely and for all ?

What is needed in Fit for 55 and REPowerEU to accommodate massive electrification in terms of investment costs? Do they leave sufficient room for available technological alternatives? While fast-tracking energy efficiency, the focus should be on local, diversified and flexible solutions, and on the adaptation of the electricity and heating grids. In times when crisis, climate change and fossil fuels phase-out inflame the spirits, there is a pressing need to discuss feasibility and effectiveness of the political options on the table. Is Fit for 55 fit to deliver timely and affordable for all customers?

A working Good is better than a wishful Best.

Molecules needed in industry and heating ?

The 2030 and 2050 targets require also decarbonization of industry and heating. Besides electrification and district heating, renewable gases and hydrogen are part of the solution to cover the diversified energy needs of energy customers - industries, citizens and local authorities. How can the Gas Package proposals enable this objective ? How will distribution grids be adapted to accommodate this industrial and heat transition ? How do local energy companies prepare to ensure the best possible balance between sustainability, security of supply and affordability, building on local energy resources and infrastructures ?

WIND ENERGY

European businesses want to source renewables to tackle energy crisis; but emergency measures risk threatening PPA market

6 October 2022

In the midst of Europe’s energy crisis, caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its subsequent cuts of gas exports to Europe, the RE-Source 2022 event[https://resource-platform.eu/re-source-2022-event/?ref=WindEurope] started today. Organised by the RE-Source Platform[https://resource-platform.eu/?ref=WindEurope], Europe’s largest corporate renewable electricity sourcing event will gather 1,000 key players in Amsterdam to exchange on renewable Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).

Driven by the high price of gas, electricity prices have increased up to 10-fold over the last year, putting European families and businesses under increasing pressure. Europe now needs home-grown renewable electricity more than ever to ensure affordable electricity, security of supply and the competitiveness of its economy.

In pursuit of energy price stability, reliable electricity supply, and carbon emission reduction, European companies continue to trust in renewables: 3.4 GW of corporate renewable PPAs were signed in the first three quarters of 2022. That’s similar to 2020, the second best year on record for PPA deals in Europe, but less than 2021. It means that the European PPA market is in decline for the first time in five years.

The RE-Source 2022 event confirms the growing appetite for corporate renewable PPAs: a record number of corporate buyers are registered for this year’s edition, with over 100 buyers participating in RE-Source for the first time.

Emergency measures risk threatening Europe’s PPA market

RE-Source 2022 takes place one week after EU Energy Ministers agreed emergency market interventions to tackle rising energy prices. The RE-Source Platform warns that a patchwork of national measures could chill the European PPA market, at a time when PPAs are more critical than ever for the market-driven renewable energy transition. European companies are eager to sign new PPAs. National market interventions must not undermine the necessary scale-up of the PPA market.

Especially the revenue cap on inframarginal technologies will have negative effects on existing and future PPAs, if not implemented properly. The EU has adopted a €180/MWh electricity revenue cap for inframarginal producers of electricity, such as wind and solar.

The recent agreement from Energy Ministers allows Member States to deviate from the uniform €180MWh revenue cap for all inframarginal technologies, to maintain national caps, or to introduce uncoordinated additional measures. No company or investor will want to sign a long-term energy contract if they don’t get the regulatory certainty they need.

Member States must clarify the implementation of the revenue cap and its application on PPAs as soon as possible to fully leverage the benefits of corporate sourcing and to unlock urgently needed renewable investments.

Joop Hazenberg, Impact Director at the RE-Source Platform, said: “Last week’s decision from Energy Ministers is an unfortunate step in the wrong direction. The potential of uncoordinated national revenue caps applying to PPAs risks chilling the market, at a time when businesses need to secure stable energy prices more than ever. We call on EU Member States to stick to the EU-wide cap, which is temporary and applies equally to all forms of inframarginal electricity production.”

HEAT PUMPS

3 reasons why heat pumps are the future of Europe’s clean and renewable heating

06 October 2022 News Article

80% of heating demand in the EU today is met by fossil fuels. We need that 80% to become 0% by 2050 to decarbonise our economy and reduce our dependence on emitting fuels.

The good news is that the power sector already has a direction, one that sees millions of heat pumps installed every year across Europe to reach 50 million by 2030.

Why heat pumps? Let’s find out

Smart, flexible, and energy efficient: heat pumps’ magic formula

Cheaper and cleaner heating is now needed more than ever. Heat pumps offer a powerful solution to this growing need as they are at least four times more energy efficient than gas and oil boilers. These electric appliances can turn one unit of electricity into four units of heat by condensing natural low-level heat from the outside air, ground, and water into significantly higher indoor heating.

Households and businesses can cut their heating carbon footprint by 75% by installing a heat pump and potentially reach net zero with a fully decarbonised grid. Moreover, such devices enable consumers to reduce their average electricity use, thereby saving energy and money on their bills.

Heat pumps are often equipped with intelligent energy management systems or smart meters. This way heating systems can respond to price signals and grid CO2 levels by matching demand when cheap renewable energy is available, thus avoiding peak hours and storing excess energy to reduce waste.

Choosing a heat pump is also a practical way for consumers to contribute to the energy transition by enabling demand-side response. This is then ensured by suppliers and demand-side services such as aggregators who remotely monitor the electric device.

Choosing a heat pump is also a practical way for consumers to contribute to the energy transition by enabling demand-side response. This is then ensured by suppliers and demand-side services such as aggregators who remotely monitor the electric device.

Some aggregator services are free of charge for customers and can unleash effortless savings not just for the heat pump owner but for the entire community. The main reason is they increase energy demand elasticity vis-à-vis prices, in other terms, consumption can be adjusted when prices are more interesting.

Scaling up demand-side response everywhere in Europe is only possible if Member States allow its entry into the electricity wholesale market as an alternative to generation. While the Commission’s Clean Energy Package[https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-strategy/clean-energy-all-europeans-package_en] has acknowledged the possibility, it hasn’t so far been adopted into national law.

Enhanced flexibility is crucial to manage grid voltage and avoid congestion explains Oliver Franz –Committee Chair at Eurelectric and Vice President of European Associations at E.ON. He noted, however, that a massive upscale of heat pumps might create issues for the grid due to high electricity demand. Operating demand-side response is thus crucial to balance the grid, especially when considering renewable deployment needs.

As estimated in Eurelectric’s Power Barometer[https://powerbarometer.eurelectric.org/], Europe would need to unlock 753 GW of new renewable capacity to meet the RePowerEU targets. While massively rolling out renewable projects, however, flexibility must be factored in. Deployment should be matched with an equivalent flexibility boost to ease renewable integration to the grid.

Marcia Poletti ­­– Head of European System Change at Octopus Energy –confirms:

“Unless you can bring more flexibility online you will inevitably see the cost of integrating renewables increase”

Heat pumps can provide that flexibility, but sales must quickly accelerate to have such an impact.

What is standing in the way of a heat pump-led heating revolution?

High upfront costs, low citizens’ awareness, and lack of trained personnel risk hampering heat pumps’ needed uptick.

Financial support, trusted advice, and certified installers are the three key enablers public and private authorities must now focus on to support heat pumps become mainstream.

Eurelectric has discussed of such challenges and opportunities with a panel of top-level experts at the European Sustainable Energy Week’s conference on “Consumer value, steady power: how heat pumps can help transform the electricity grid[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn1bm0OuRTA&t=97s]”.

We are now stepping up our efforts to push for cheap clean and renewable heating all over Europe with our new platform Power to Buildings[mailto:mkaru@eurelectric.org], to be launched on 20 October in Brussels.

Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi held a positive and constructive meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv today, discussing the situation at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) in light of recent developments regarding the ownership of the facility and their consequences.

They also discussed the Director General’s proposal for the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the plant and agreed to meet again after his impending trip to the Russian Federation.

The difficulties for personnel at the ZNPP have intensified this week, with staff facing demands to sign a new employment contract with Russian state company Rosatom to keep their jobs, while national Ukrainian operator Energoatom is urging them not to do so and instead follow its instructions.

Director General Grossi said ZNPP staff were being subjected to unacceptable pressure, carrying out their crucial work tasks under increasingly difficult conditions with potentially severe consequences for nuclear safety and security.

“This is a particularly dangerous moment for the safety and security of the ZNPP. Staff at the plant are being forced to make a hugely difficult decision for themselves and their loved ones. The enormous pressure they are facing must stop,” he said.

Europe’s largest nuclear power plant is held by Russian forces but is operated by its Ukrainian staff. Over the past seven months, the staff have continued to conduct their important duties in order to prevent the danger of a nuclear accident during the current military conflict, in extremely challenging circumstances with frequent shelling at the plant or near it.

“The plant’s courageous staff deserve our sincere gratitude and respect for continuing to fulfil their vital tasks in unimaginably difficult conditions, with their workplace located in the middle of a war zone. There is a need for urgent action to make their jobs and lives easier, not the opposite,” Director General Grossi said.

The Director General, who has repeatedly expressed grave concern about the stressful and challenging working conditions at the ZNPP, said the psychological impact on staff was detrimental to nuclear safety and security.

The latest developments risk exacerbating the situation by leading to confusion on who is charge as well as ambiguity about the command-and-control chain at the plant, he said.

This week’s developments could have a direct impact on several of the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars the Director General outlined in March, including one stating that “operating staff must be able to fulfil their safety and security duties and have the capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure” and another saying, “there must be reliable communications with the regulator and others”.

Separately today, the IAEA team at the ZNPP reported that there had been shelling in an industrial area close to the access road to the plant.

Nationale Biomassestrategie darf Potenziale der Bioenergie und deren wesentliche Vorteile für das Energiesystem der Zukunft nicht gefährden

Berlin, 06.10.2022: Heute legte die Bundesregierung ihr Eckpunktepapier für eine Nationale Biomassestrategie vor, welche als Grundlage eines sich nun anschließenden Dialoges zwischen Vertretern aus Politik, Wirtschaft, Wissenschaft und Gesellschaft dient und bereits 2023 verabschiedet werden soll.

Die vorgestellten Eckpunkte sind Auftakt einer wichtigen, lang erwarteten und gesamtgesellschaftlich ausgearbeiteten Strategie zur Verwendung nachhaltiger Biomasse. Wenngleich im Papier der Bundesre-gierung lediglich im Konjunktiv formuliert, ist zu unterstreichen, dass die Bioenergie unverzichtbar für die notwendige Transformation unseres Wirtschaftssystems, unsere langfristigen Klimaschutz- und Bio-diversitätsziele sowie zur Erreichung der Energiewende im Ganzen ist. Der Dialogprozess muss dem Rechnung tragen.

Denn die Bioenergie tritt dort als Problemlöser auf, wo andere Klimaschutztechnologien an ihre Grenzen kommen. Schon heute sorgt die Bioenergie für eine Bereitstellung gesicherter sowie flexibler Leistung im Zuge des Kohle- und Atomausstiegs. Daneben gibt sie Antworten auf hochenergetische Prozesse bei der industriellen Prozesswärme sowie dem Schwerlast- und Fernverkehr und dem großen PKW-Bestand. Perspektivisch ersetzt Bioenergie nicht nur fossile Energieträger, sondern kann als einzige erneuerbare und nachhaltig zertifizierte Energieform entlang der gesamten Nutzungskette CO2 binden und dauerhaft im Produktionssystem, das mit dem Anbau beginnt, speichern.

Im Fokus der zukünftigen Entwicklung der Bioenergie muss eine geschickte Kombination mit anderen Klimaschutztechnologien zur Hebung bestehender und im Eckpunktepapier nicht aufgeführter Synergien stehen. Gleichzeitig muss ein Augenmerk auf der intensiveren Erschließung zusätzlicher nachhaltiger Biomassepotenziale, der Gewinnung von Koppelprodukten sowie elementarer Ressourcen mithilfe neuer effizienterer Verfahren liegen. Ebenso wird die Kaskaden- und Mehrfachnutzung noch stärker in den Blick genommen. Daneben kann innovativ genutzte Anbaubiomasse zukünftig einen wertvollen Beitrag zum Klima- und Artenschutz leisten sowie gleichzeitig der Nahrungsmittel- und Energieproduktion Rechnung tragen. Die Biomassestrategie wird ausdrücklich als Mittel- bis Langfriststrategie angekündigt. Grundsätz-lich sollte jedoch kein Vorrang der stofflichen vor der energetischen Nutzung festgeschrieben werden, da für qualitativ unterschiedliche Biomassesortimente auch unterschiedliche Verwertungspfade benötigt werden.

Die Bundesregierung muss daher mit Augenmaß und Fachlichkeit vorgehen, sodass die inzwischen er-reichte gesamtwirtschaftliche Bedeutung des Bioenergiesektors für den ländlichen Raum nicht gefährdet, sondern auch technologisch innovativ weiterentwickelt wird. Die bereits erreichte Resilienz unserer Energiesystems gilt es weiter auszubauen, so kann und wird dem Klimaschutz gleichzeitig Rechnung getragen. Die Bioenergieverbände haben bereits im vergangenen April einen ersten Input zu dem an-stehenden Strategieprozess unterbreitet.

Dena-Umfrage: Bundesbürger ändern wegen steigender Energiekosten ihr Heizverhalten – und wollen mehr staatliche Hilfe für Bürger mit geringen und mittleren Einkommen

In praktisch allen privaten Haushalten ist der weitgehende Stopp russischer Gaslieferungen und die Lage der Energieversorgung Topthema, so die von forsa durchgeführte repräsentative Umfrage. Fast alle Befragten vermuten einen zum Teil deutlichen Anstieg der Heizkosten, aber erst die Hälfte hat bereits eine Erhöhung erhalten oder ist über die anstehenden Kostensteigerungen informiert worden. 32 Prozent haben noch keine eigenen Sparmaßnahmen vorgenommen, aber die überwiegende Mehrheit der Befragten reagiert bereits mit geändertem Heizverhalten. Mit Blick auf die anstehenden finanziellen Entlastungen der Bundesregierung will eine sehr große Mehrheit eine Fokussierung auf die Bürgerinnen und Bürgern mit geringen oder mittleren Einkommen.

Berlin, 6. Oktober 2022. Die Bundesbürger haben klare Vorstellungen davon, wen die wegen der hohen Energiepreise aufgelegten oder geplanten Maßnahmen- und Entlastungspakete vor allem erreichen sollten: Eine deutliche Mehrheit von 83 % sprach sich für die finanzielle Entlastung von Bürgern mit geringem und mittleren Einkommen durch die Bundesregierung aus, ergab die vom Meinungsforschungsinstitut forsa im Auftrag der dena erstellte Umfrage. Dagegen denken lediglich 15 % der Befragten, dass alle Bürgerinnen und Bürger unabhängig von ihrem Einkommen entlastet werden sollten. Diese Position vertraten häufiger Bezieher höherer Nettoeinkommen.

Wegen der steigenden Energiepreise und der Energieknappheit planen zwei Drittel der Haushalte, konkret zu reagieren und beispielsweise ihr Heiz- und Lüftungsverhalten, die Heiztechnik oder die Wärmedämmung zu ändern.

So wollen 4 von 10 Befragten das Thermostat runterregeln und stärker auf Heizzeiten achten, weniger Räume zu heizen beabsichtigen 32 %. Änderungen an der bestehenden Heizanlage plant knapp jeder fünfte Haushalt (19 %), am häufigsten genannt dabei die Absenkung der Vorlauftemperatur.

14 % der Befragten haben vor, das Heizsystem zu erweitern oder auszutauschen, so durch die Anschaffung elektrischer Heizkörper (4 %), die Investition in erneuerbare Technologien wie Solarthermie (4 %) oder den Einbau eines zusätzlichen Ofens oder Kamins (3 %). Dämmmaßnahmen an der Gebäudehülle planen 8 % der Befragten.

Andreas Kuhlmann, Vorsitzender der dena-Geschäftsführung: „Die Umfrage zeigt, dass die Krise in nahezu allen Haushalten angekommen ist und für entsprechende Verunsicherung, aber auch viele Aktivitäten sorgt. Der Informationsstand über die besten Handlungsoptionen ist allerdings noch deutlich ausbaufähig. Hier sehe ich durch eine Intensivierung der Kommunikation mit einer stärkeren und vor allem fokussierteren Ausrichtung auf die richtigen Zielgruppen noch eine Menge Einsparpotential für den anstehenden Winter. Die Menschen im Land haben überdies ein gutes Gefühl für die Notwendigkeit, die knappen finanziellen Ressourcen gut auf die besonders betroffenen Einkommensgruppen zu konzentrieren. Ein wichtiger Hinweis für die Gaskommission und die politischen Akteure, die deren Vorschläge dann möglichst rasch in konkretes und schnell wirkendes Handeln umsetzen müssen“.

Etwa die Hälfte der Energie-(Mit-)Entscheider fühlt sich derzeit gut darüber informiert, wie im Haushalt Heizenergie eingespart werden kann. Bevorzugte Informationsquellen der Befragten zum Thema Energie sind unter anderem der Bekannten- und Kollegenkreis, Energieversorger und Stadtwerke sowie Verbraucherorganisationen. Allerdings: In Haushalten mit Erdgasheizung konnte nur eine Minderheit der Energie-(Mit-)Entscheider/innen angeben, wie viele Kilowattstunden Erdgas ihre Heizung verbraucht. Genau konnten dies nur 18 % angeben, 30 % zumindest ungefähr. Etwa die Hälfte der Befragten konnte nicht angeben, wie viele Kilowattstunden Erdgas sie im Jahr für Heizung verbrauchen. Dies betraf überdurchschnittlich oft Mieter, Alleinlebende und Befragte mit einem Haushaltsnettoeinkommen von unter 2.000 Euro.

Für die Umfrage wurden im Zeitraum vom 2. bis 19. September 2022 insgesamt 1.019 Interviews durchgeführt.

Main themes on selected current affairs programmes on Austrian TV on 2-5 October

As the first snow fell in the Austrian Alps, once again the domestic energy situation was vividly discussed in Austrian media outlets during the period under review. However, in reviewing the political events of the previous week, commercial broadcaster ATVs Sunday evening programme ATV Aktuell: Die Woche focussed on next Sunday's presidential election. Public broadcaster ORF's political talk show Im Zentrum undertook an attempt to shed light on the alleged sabotage of the two Nord Stream pipelines and raised the question whether the attacks were signalling a further escalation of the conflict between Russia and the West. While commercial broadcaster PULS 24's Newsroom LIVE introduced its viewers to the upcoming pension reform, pubic broadcaster ORF's morning show Oe1-Morgenmagazin brought good tidings, when a minister announced that Austria had "a good safety cushion for this winter".

Presidential elections, one week to go

On 2 October at 2020 gmt on commercial broadcaster ATV's Sunday evening programme ATV Aktuell: Die Woche, moderator Meinrad Knapp, political adviser Thomas Hofer and pollster Peter Hajek reviewed the political events of the week.

The main topic was the presidential election that Austria will hold on 9 October.

According to Thomas Hofer, incumbent Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen (VdB) has been driving through this election campaign with "the handbrake on". "This is also the dominant strategy because he doesn't want to put himself on an equal footing with the other candidates, so he avoids any confrontation with his opponents." However, Hofer added, "that's not the only reason because from time to time he tips over in such situations, as seen in the unmoderated duel in the previous election campaign. And that was no different when he was still the leader of the Green Party."

Of course the VdB wanted to sail through the election campaign and Hofer believed that he would succeed, "but of course there is a certain contradiction with the mobilisation. If you don't want to run an election campaign and you plan to do the same and say, if you please, I would prefer not to appear anywhere so as not to make mistakes and offend anyone, then there is a latent danger that you will leave the field to the others."

Most candidates disqualified themselves

But from the point of view of the Van der Bellen voters, Hofer opined that the other candidates had disqualified themselves. "The more so-called ideas come there, especially from the right-wing spectrum, the more likely voters would be determined to get it done in the first round," he said

Pollster Peter Hajek estimated the chances for a second round as "1 to 10". "Of course we have to wait for 9 October, but Van der Bellen's chances are very, very good."

As every week, Hajek discussed the results of his latest opinion poll in which he had asked 500 Austrians: "Regardless of who you will vote for in the first round of the presidential election, would you like to have a run-off election afterwards?"

Polls, majority against runoff

A majority of 52% of those questioned, representative of the Austrian population, were against a second ballot in the federal presidential election. Some 27% of them "definitely don't want" a runoff after the ballot on 9 October, while 25% would "rather not" want it. On the other hand, 17% would "definitely" want a runoff election, while 15% of Austrians would "rather" support it. Some 16% of respondents had no opinion on this.

There were big differences among supporters of political parties. While for the vast majority of OeVP (63%) and SPOe voters (68%) one ballot in this year's federal presidential election would be sufficient, 58% of FPOe voters favoured a second ballot and thus a runoff.

Peter Hajek: "Apart from the fact that the VdB [President Alexander Van der Bellen] supporters, and that is the majority of voters, naturally do not want a second round of voting, the current concerns of the population overshadow the election for the federal president."

Explosions in Baltic Sea, looking for culprit

Concerning the explosions in the Nord Stream gas pipelines, experts speculated that this might be a further escalation by Russian President Putin in the Ukraine war.

On public broadcaster ORF's political talk show Im Zentrum, ORF moderator Claudia Reiterer raised several questions: Who had an interest in the destruction of the two gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea? What about the protection of other critical infrastructure in Europe, also in Austria? Were we also experiencing a new form of psychological warfare that relied primarily on fear and destabilisation? What were the right political answers to this? And would the debate about the usefulness of the sanctions against Russia get new fuel?

Reiterer's guests, foreign policy spokesperson of the Greens, Ewa Ernst-Dziedzic; FPOe deputy party chairwoman Marlene Svazek; Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, director of the State Security and Intelligence Service at the Interior Ministry; Gabriel Felbermayr, director of the Economic Research Institute WIFO, and political scientist Jeremy Stoehs, deputy director of the ACIPSS Austrian Centre for Intelligence, Propaganda and Security Studies, tried to find the answers.

Nash equilibrium, back to Cold War strategies

Deriving parallels from the Nash equilibrium - a decision-making game theory by US mathematician and Nobel price laureate John Forbers Nash Jr., that directly shaped the Cold War strategies of the US and the Soviet Union, Gabriel Felbermayr, director of the Economic Research Institute WIFO, argued that the game theory was certainly a place where one could find an answer. Nash's theorem always emphasised how threats could be used to induce the opponent to do something or not to do something that may not actually be in the opponent's interest at all. And the big question was how can threats be credible?

Credibility was very important, Felbermayr said, and one had to send out signals for that. But signals had to be expensive to be credible. In the language of game theory it was called 'Costly signalling'. The WIFO director naturally did not know if that was the case, but if these explosions in the pipelines were made by Russia, it would, so to speak, be something that hurt Russia itself. "Russia has been lobbying massively for precisely these pipelines for years. These are projects worth billions, but that is exactly why it would be a signal that is expensive for Russia itself and to be able to say that we are ready to escalate, even if it has financial disadvantages for us and destroys the infrastructure that we have fought for a long time," said Felbermayr.

He added that it"wouldn't be entirely surprising" if it went in that direction and recalled that Russia had been flaring off gigantic amounts of gas for weeks. "One can also ask oneself, isn't it to the great detriment of Russia itself that such a valuable resource is wasted? This is also costly signalling, which means that game theory gives us a hand. But we don't know who is behind it, and one could also assume such costly signalling strategies in other players."

All roads lead to Moscow, but ...

Political scientist Jeremy Stoehs, deputy director of the ACIPSS (Austrian Centre for Intelligence, Propaganda and Security Studies) conceded that against the background of the Ukraine conflict, there were "many indications that it could have been Russia, but there are many possibilities". It was an act of sabotage, "I don't think we can presume an accident, since it affects both pipelines. The technical prerequisites must be in place. That means it must have been a state actor. A state actor that has the technical prerequisites for this and also has a motive for it and has chosen a point in time that is expedient for this actor."

Stoehs believed that some of the countries around the Baltic Sea had the capabilities. On the other hand, against the background of the Ukraine war and the Russian attack, there were many indications that this had been a Russian action or controlled by Russia, "also because Russia is really good in the underwater area in terms of maritime capabilities, has a strong set up in the area, and also because it is an escalation on the one hand but also a part of hybrid warfare".

The deputy director wanted the viewers at home to understand that the oceans in general were an area where a great deal that could go unnoticed. Unlike in the air or on land, where one could get information and a picture of the situation really quickly through satellites and other sources, this was not the case in the sea.

On high alert after attacks on Nord Stream pipeline

If Russia was responsible for this sabotage, then it was certainly a signal that they have the skills to do the same elsewhere. The Danish, Swedish and Norwegian armed forces, including the coast guard, have increased their presence in these areas. Norway is very dependent on oil exports and there was a good chance that acts of sabotage could also occur here in the future, Jeremy Stoehs argued. "You can't protect this infrastructure in the sea because there are simply too many kilometres of cables, data cables and then pipelines. You can't patrol that with military skills. It is much more about building resilience so that you are not dependent on a pipeline, for example, or on a data cable," Stoehs concluded.

Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, director of the DNS (Directorate State Security and Intelligence Service) at the Interior Ministry made the point that the protection of critical infrastructure was not primarily a task of the secret services, but one also had to recognise the overall approach. It was an all-government approach designed to protect critical infrastructure. Of course, the secret services or the intelligence services here in Europe also had "an important task right now, with this war in Ukraine, and of course we also have an intensive exchange here in Austria with our European partners. The point here is primarily to see where does this attack come from?"

Better protection of critical infrastructure

Haijawi-Pirchner tried to define what critical infrastructure was: "We speak of critical infrastructure when companies are affected that have a public supply mandate, be it in this case with gas, energy, oil, and electricity, which is of course paramount for us. And if this critical infrastructure is to be protected, then not only protective measures are required on site, where in Austria, for example, the police have the task, but also many players, many stakeholders who have to come to an assessment together."

FPOe deputy party chairwoman Marlene Svazek argued that the guests on the show could not definitively accuse Russia, when a final judgement with regards to the perpetrators was still outstanding. "I'm firstly asking myself: cui bono?" The Nord Stream pipelines were always a connection between Europe and Russia, and this line had now been de facto cut. "Of course, there is always something in the connecting line that can be used for negotiations. In the last few weeks and months we have had political debates flaring up here, too, where people are discussing it, well maybe we should negotiate with Russia at least about this resource, about gas supplies, again," Svazek recalled.

The FPOe politician pointed to the current situation: "We might be able to get through the winter now, but we don't know how it will look in spring, how it will look when it's refilled in spring. We know the economic situation. I think a lot of people are talking to companies that say we can still produce to cover costs up to the end of November at the latest. Until the first contracts expire, until we get new electricity contracts, then we don't know how things will continue."

No need for self-harming in Russia

In view of this situation, Svazek thought it would be or was a shot in the foot for Russia to cut this connecting line, when in Europe the pressure would "probably become so high at some point, especially from the population", that one could consider the need to discuss the import of Russian gas again. She argued that there was only this pipeline from Russia and if Russia wanted to turn off the gas, then it would turn it off. The Kremlin did not have to destroy its own critical infrastructure to do this.

"But if you stick to game theory, yes," Svazek admitted, "then it makes perfect sense. But I am a bit tired of talking about theories, because the truth is that we are feeling the effects of these sanctions every day. And these were decided without anyone in Austria being asked about it."

She warned the situation was already dire, but would get much worse in the spring. "And then I will not only worry about the security of the infrastructure in Austria, but also about social security. I think that is the biggest problem that we in Austria, as Austrian politicians, have to solve."

Make Austrians feel safe again

For foreign policy spokesperson of the Greens Ewa Ernst-Dziedzic, it was important to understand what one could do to actually end this war quickly and to actually give the people in Austria the feeling that they were safe again, which was presently not the case.

"On the one hand, we are dealing with a situation where many say, let's sit down at the negotiating table, let's end the sanctions and Russia is not that bad. On the other hand, we see how Putin is not only escalating here through the annexation, not only escalating through the partial mobilisation, since he promised a few months ago not to call in reservists, but he is also escalating over a new front that he is opening," Ernst-Dziedzic said.

According to her, the attacks on critical infrastructure was a new front. "I can't judge who is behind these leaks either, but from a purely strategic point of view, it would underpin this game theory in the sense that the focus is credibly directed at something else, but at the same time it shows Europe how dependent we are not only on energy, and therefore come under pressure here and have become open to blackmail, but also on the flow through all these connections, and not just the energy reserves but also enormous amounts of data," the Greens politician argued.

This meant that when we talked about Putin not stopping at Ukraine, but possibly also wanting to attack the Baltic States, we had to be clear that this did not start with a nuclear attack or conventional weapons, but also "that, for example, Estonia to name a concrete example, simply lost all the power and all data and Internet access to resources. This is a new type of warfare that we call hybrid, and that's what we're facing right now", Ernst-Dziedzic said.

Plead for more sanctions

Ernst-Dziedzic pleaded to expand the sanctions. "Only 20% of the oligarchs and the millionaires who support Putin and who support the whole system are on this sanctions list." The politician rejected claims that the sanctions harmed the West more than Russia, quoting studies that showed over 6.5% of Russia's economic output had been "in the red in recent months".

She recalled that many weapons could not be produced at all because the technologies were lacking. Many supply chains were interrupted by the sanctions, which meant the sanctions were working. "We have to use them in a targeted manner, because Putin wouldn't react like this and wouldn't escalate if what we're doing now hadn't worked over the past few months. We should not forget that," Ernst-Dziedzic concluded.

Economist Gabriel Felbermayr argued that if was naïve to hope that sanctions would be imposed and then the behaviour of the person sanctioned would change immediately. "Because if the West's threat of sanctions was credible and Putin invades Ukraine anyway, then he must obviously have been willing to bear the costs. That means we need stamina." Now, after seven months of war in Ukraine we saw traces in Russia. "They are smaller than we thought. I, and most of my colleagues, predicted a 10% slump in Russia's economic output this year. That's not true. It's less and also has a lot to do with the fact that the sanctioning coalition is ultimately a relatively small one. China is not participating, India is not participating, Turkey so-so and Russia continues to sell oil, for example," said the Director of the Economic Research Institute WIFO.

Putin running out of escalation options

He explained that the trackers that measured this showed that a lot of the oil that no longer went to Europe was simply taken somewhere else. But at the same time there were these costs. Felbermayr recalled that Russia had de facto turned off the gas tap. Only about an eighth of the volume of gas that previously flowed to Europe now came through. With all the consequences: gas prices, supply insecurity and so on. "We feel it massively here, that's true. At the same time, however, once the gas has been turned off, Russia no longer has any escalation options at this level. Less than 0 cannot flow through the pipelines, and that means if you want to continue manipulating the gas price, and it went up by 15% right after these acts of sabotage, if you want to stir up supply insecurity, if you want to arouse people's fear, then such measures are of course suitable for this."

Addressing the question of further, harsher sanctions against Russia, the Director of the Economic Research Institute WIFO asked rhetorically: "What have we already done as sanctions? The oil embargo will not really happen until January 1 next year, so far we are buying Russian oil. We didn't even sanction the gas ourselves, Russia turned it off. We have added certain technology goods to the list. We've put banks on lists, but with major exceptions. Why exceptions? So we can buy gas. Now, however, hardly any gas comes from Russia at around an eighth of the normal amounts. The sanctions regime, which was designed with holes in it so that gas can continue to flow, could in fact be tightened now without causing us any great costs. Because less than 0 gas cannot come from Russia and we have a few levers in our hands, so to speak, that would probably hurt Russia."

West could sanction exports of medical equipment

Felbermayr suggested that sanctions imposed on medicines and medical devices could probably really hurt the regime in Moscow. "I don't want that because human lives are immediately involved, but it's not like we're helpless and can put up with anything." The West had to realize that it too had the option of sanctions, and could also threaten. "The best threat is always the one you don't have to use, but this geostrategic thinking, we haven't really done that well in the West so far. We haven't laid all the cards on the table yet."

While Marlene Svazek condemned the war of aggression and agreed on the need of sending a clear and unified signal from Europe, she also argued that the West also had a responsibility. Although economic output in Russia was collapsing, economic output in the West was also decreasing albeit not to the same extent. However, one had to compare not just numbers, thought the FPOe deputy party chairwoman.

Sanctions a quick shot

"You have to look at how things are really developing here, how things are developing in society. We said from the start: these sanctions are a quick shot. We once said that if this ends badly, it will hit our own people harder than those we actually want to hit," Marlene Svazek argued, adding that Austria was still a neutral country.

Returning to the topic of the attacks on the pipelines under the Baltic Sea, Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, explained that the current global political situation was also included in the risk analysis to protect the critical infrastructure in Austria. He recalled that immediately after the beginning of the war, the critical infrastructure in Austria was protected more strongly than before.

EU wide programme to protect critical infrastructure

The DNS director said that the Austrian security agency were in an exchange with the operators. There was a separate national programme for protecting critical infrastructure, similar to the one on the European level. That meant it was screened from the outset, what critical infrastructure was. "There are sectors, for example energy, where you then look very specifically together with the operator for the vulnerable points of this critical infrastructure." For every selected company and for every structure, protection plans were considered. The issue of critical infrastructure was very much about resilience, and work was currently being done on a new directive at European level, a directive to protect critical facilities, and here resilience would be much more important in the future, "because as already mentioned, if a pipeline fails, it must also be possible to supply a whole country with gas through other pipelines".

Pension adjustments in Austria

Youth State Secretary Claudia Plakolm (OeVP) spoke in an interview with the commercial broadcaster PULS 24's Newsroom LIVE on 2 October at 1700 gmt about the pension increase and youth unemployment, and explained why she considered the pension adjustment to be successful and which anti-inflation measures the government was also taking for young people.

It was a "solution with a sense of proportion" that does not burden the budget in the long term and is therefore also fair for the generations, said the State Secretary for Youth in relation to the newly presented pension reform. In 2023, pensions were expected to increase by between 5.8% and 10.2%, with minimum pensions in particular benefiting from the new regulation. "We help where the support is most urgently needed," said Plakolm.

With regard to inflation, she particularly praised the one-off payments criticised by the SPOe. "We cannot live at the expense of the next generation," argued the youth secretary. One-time payments ensured that no more was spent in the long term than was available, she noted.

Federal aid for youth

The younger generation was also being supported by the government, said Claudia Plakolm. It would benefit from one-off payments such as climate and energy bonuses and, in the longer term, from the abolition of cold progression. Access to the self-supporting grant had been made easier for students, but there was also support for apprentices. This included, for example, the extension of the Digi-Scheck, which was used to promote training-related courses for apprentices. However, Plakolm did not want to commit herself to wage increases: "The social partners do that, politics does not interfere here."

Gas storage optimism

Austria reached the necessary gas storage level of 80% earlier than planned. On pubic broadcaster ORF's morning show Oe1-Morgenmagazin on 4 October at 0600 gmt, Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler (Greens) was optimistic about this winter, although one had to keep an eye on developments.

"The security of supply in Austria is currently ensured. But it is also clear that the current circumstances remain challenging," said Gewessler. With 80% gas storage capacity, Austria had "a good safety cushion for this winter".

Austrian gas that is not for Austrians

But the gas in Austrian storage facilities did not automatically belong to domestic households and industry. According to the ministry, only seven of the current 76 terawatt hours (TWh) were gas from Austria for Austria. This was the first part of the strategic gas reserve of 20 TWh.

The entire 20 TWh would be available by 1 November. Until then, they would be continuously stored. Large amounts were already in the storage facilities, but they were not yet completely filled, as storage would still take place in October.

According to Gewessler, thanks to the "well-filled storage tanks" there was no need for energy management. The state did not intervene in the gas supply and did not distribute gas according to priority. However, households did not have to reckon with mandatory energy saving measures. However, the energy-saving recommendations of the "Mission 11" campaign still applied to households, according to Gewessler.

For the energy minister, however, the question remained as to how the other variables would behave: "Will we have an exceptionally cold winter? Is gas consumption enormously high or can we manage to save gas together? What does the international gas market look like? What quantities are coming to Europe?" According to Gewessler, "a lot of variables would simply come together."

Austrian companies have invested a lot in Russia and are feeling the consequences of sanctions, Chancellor Karl Nehammer said at a climate conference organized by the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber.

"Sanctions especially affect Austrian businesses. They invested a lot in Ukraine and also in the Russian Federation," the Chancellor said, in a speech streamed by the Oe24 TV Channel.

Austrian companies and industry feared a gas shortage but supported the sanction policy nevertheless, Nehammer noted. Europe had relied for years on cheap and reliable supplies from Russia and trade relations were at the heart of the EU's policy of rapprochement with Russia. "The entire globalized economy is designed to create dependencies," the Chancellor added.

Austria has managed to reduce the share of Russian gas in its supply from 79% to 21%, the country’s economy ministry reported earlier.

Romania-Schengen/Pirvulescu: Today's vote will complicate situation in the country, where it will be a big disappointment

Bucharest, Dec 8 /Agerpres/ - Political scientist Cristian Pirvulescu declared, on Thursday, that the vote given in the Council of Justice and Home Affairs against Romania's accession to the Schengen Area, based on the issue of migration, will complicate the 'situations' in the country, where there was 'a great expectation', so there will be 'a big disappointment', the political scientist Cristian Pirvulescu declared, on Thursday, for AGERPRES.

'I think that the real reasons are those that Austria told, those related to the issue of migration. That the issue of migration was put on the European agenda, that is another discussion. But the reason why they (Austria, ed. n.) preferred to make their internal image to make them seem like heroes of the fight against illegal immigration was this, the problem of the Schengen Area, which is viewed by many Austrians, as well as by many Europeans, as a vulnerability. Because the Schengen Area allows free movement of the crowds,' Pirvulescu said.

'It is a short-term interest. It is very likely that there were also Russian interests, yet never direct, but indirect, and, in the end, Austria's decision was linked to the issue of migration and it could not have yielded. The calculation that the Romanians made, that the Austrians would give in to pressure, it turned out to be uninspired, and those who promised support for Romania could not do it in extremis and could not sanction Croatia for this reason,' the analyst said.

Asked what Romania has to do next, Cristian Pirvulescu said that 'the Swedes, who will take over the Presidency from January 1, will take over the file and try to complete it'.

He said that the Thursday vote 'will greatly complicate the situations in the country, where there was a great expectation, so there will be a great disappointment, with consequences related to anti-European feelings, extremist tendencies, etc.'

'I don't know if this was the calculation that Austria made, but, for sure, it is the calculation that Russia made when, through intermediaries, it suggested this electoral tactics to the Austrian People's Party, whose relations with Russia are notorious,' Cristian Pîrvulescu also said.AGERPRES(RO - author: Daniel Popescu, editor: Mihai Simionescu; EN - author: Catalin Cristian Trandafir, editor: Maria Voican)

KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: Reporting half a million new COVID infections every day.

In Dongguan -- this is a major manufacturing hub in the south. It's home to 10 million people. Officials there are seeing between 250,000 and 350,000 new cases a day.

And in Zhejiang province -- this is located just south of Shanghai -- officials there are reporting more than one million new COVID cases every day. Now, context is key here. This is a province of 64 million people, so by CNN calculations, that is just over 1,500 new daily infections for every 100,000 people.

A Zhejiang health official there says that the current wave of infection is expected to peak around New Year's Day -- that's roughly a week from now -- with two million new cases of COVID-19 every day.

Back to you, Whitney.

WHITNEY WILD, CNN ANCHOR: Kristie Lu Stout, thank you so much.

All right. Peru is in political crisis following a growing national protest in the aftermath of the ouster and impeachment of its former president, Pedro Castillo. The Peruvian government is accusing Mexico of interfering in its internal affairs as Castillo's family seeks asylum there.

CNN's Rafael Romo has more.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR (voice-over): Upon arriving in Mexico, they were received as distinguished guests by immigration authorities who handed them migration documents.

ANDRES MANUEL LOPEZ OBRADOR, PRESIDENT OF MEXICO: (Speaking foreign language).

ROMO (voice-over): Mexican President confirmed Wednesday the wife and two minor children of former Peruvian President Pedro Castillo were granted asylum at the Mexican Embassy in Lima after he was impeached by the South American country's congress following his attempt to dissolve it.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Speaking foreign language).

ROMO (voice-over): The former Mexican ambassador to Peru also confirmed that Pedro Castillo asked for asylum but was detained by Peruvian authorities before he was able to reach the Mexican Embassy building in Lima.

Now, the former president -- seen there the day he was detained -- faces charges of rebellion and conspiracy.

Peru's new government is furious about President Lopez Obrador's public support of former President Castillo, going as far as ordering the Mexican ambassador to Peru to leave the country and declaring him persona non grata.

ROMO (on camera): The political crisis has become an international saga with the new Peruvian government accusing Mexico of meddling in its internal affairs. And Mexico saying the due process rights of Pedro Castillo were violated when he was ousted. But Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador didn't stop there. He also railed against the U.S. government.

OBRADOR (through translator): And I, to be honest, am very sorry that the United States government, which always talks about democracy -- in this case, instead of asking that the will of the people be respected, that the democratically-elected president be respected -- what they end up doing is endorsing all the shady maneuvers to remove the president.

ROMO (voice-over): More specifically, the Mexican president criticized the recent meeting U.S. ambassador to Peru Lisa Kenna held with current Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, who succeeded Castillo, as well as other officials in the new government. He also criticized the fact that the White House recognizes Boluarte as the legitimate president of Peru when Mexico still considers Castillo, the South American country's true president.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Embassy in Lima said on Twitter that "The United States reaffirms its respect for the democratic institutions in Peru and rejects any misinformation that promotes contrary ideas. We continue to support of the people of Peru and call for peace and unity."

President Lopez Obrador is expected to host both U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early January for the North American Leaders' Summit to be held in Mexico City.

Headlines from around the globe right now. China is sending 71 planes across the Taiwan Strait in a show of aggression. This, after President Biden signed a huge U.S. spending bill that includes money to help modernize Taiwan's military.

Ten skiers that were feared lost or missing after an Austrian avalanche on Sunday have now been found alive. Four are injured, but only one seriously.

Police in Brazil have arrested a man accused of planting explosive devices one week ahead of the presidential inauguration there. Police say the suspect identified others in the plot and more arrests are coming.

Russia's Defense Ministry says three servicemen have been killed after a Ukrainian drone was shot down as it approached a Russian airfield.

Meanwhile, President Putin says he wants to negotiate over Ukraine, but Kyiv and its supporters have refused talks.

CNN's Nic Robertson has more.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): This year's war in Ukraine, the biggest land war in Europe since 1945, is both a symptom of diplomacy's limits and a harbinger with potential decay to come.

[05:35:01]

Russian President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked aggression is yet to be tamed by sanction or reason despite diplomatic outreach.

OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR: (through translator): I believe it's right to have constant discussions. There must be a moment where Russia realizes that it needs to get out of this situation.

ROBERTSON (voice-over): China's Xi Jinping, whose increasingly bellicose diplomacy defying claims to Taiwan, is watching Ukraine, learning possible international limits on his own potential land grab.

Scholz, who is picking up his predecessor Angela Merkel's peacemaking mantle, used his recent visit to Beijing to try to shut down Russia's war and head off one over Taiwan.

SCHOLZ (through translator): It is important for China to use its influence on Russia. It is about principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.

ROBERTSON (voice-over): Twenty-twenty-two has tested diplomacy more than any other year in decades.

On the upside, democracies have risen to the challenge. Diplomatic unity in the face of Russian aggression.

EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE (through translator): As war returns to European soil, we need to become brothers in arms once more.

ROBERTSON (voice-over): On the downside, it's shown diplomatic words alone won't work. They need to be backed by military muscle.

JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: What happens at the negotiating table depends on what happens on the battlefield. Therefore, the best way to increase the chances for a peaceful solution is to support Ukraine. We will not back down.

ROBERTSON (voice-over): The past year is setting the stage for diplomatic storms to come.

VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): We will defend ourselves with all available means at our disposal.

ROBERTSON (voice-over): Putin continues to tease the threat of a nuclear strike, potentially taking diplomacy in 2023 to its limits.

FERNANDO ARIAS, ORGANIZATION FOR THE PROHIBITION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS: It does exacerbate the existing tensions to a point where unity of the international community cannot be presumed.

ROBERTSON (voice-over): Add to this the increasing tensions with China and 2023 is shaping up to be an even challenge than 2022.

RISHI SUNAK, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: We recognize China poses a systemic challenge to our values and interests -- a challenge that grows more acute as it moves towards even greater authoritarianism.

ROBERTSON (voice-over): Paradoxically, another growing challenge, climate change, perhaps offers a way out of the downward diplomatic spiral -- a need to combat global warming together.

JOHN KERRY, U.S. SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR CLIMATE: And we have been working very closely -- without China -- even if the U.S. is, as we are, moving towards a 1.5-degree program, which we are -- if we don't have China, nobody else can make it to that goal.

ROBERTSON (voice-over): As with previous years, 2023 will offer opportunity to develop diplomatic off-ramps, perhaps none more poignant than the G7 to be hosted by Japan in Hiroshima.

There will be another climate summit, too. But as this year's COP 27 in Egypt showed, during global economic hardship domestic politics trump collective salvation.

The G20, in India, could be a place where compromises are made. The war in Ukraine would be in its 19th month and by then, battlefield realties hard to ignore despite Putin's new threats of a long war.

ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: This will end, and it will end almost certainly with diplomacy, with a negotiation. But what I think we have to see is a just and durable peace, not a phony peace.

ROBERTSON (voice-over): So, the big diplomatic question for 2023, how to get Putin to agree. The answer may lie in the soaring food and energy costs triggered by the war. If the global situation worsens, collective pressure for some kind of peace will increase. The test of 2023 -- what to do if Putin ignores the warnings.

Nic Robertson, CNN, London.

WILD: Nic, thank you.

Ahead, delivery delays. You are not the only one whose holiday gifts never arrived. And why there are more heart attacks this week than at any other time of year. All that coming up next.

(COMMERCIAL)

[05:43:02]

WILD: Welcome back to CNN. It is about 5:43 here on the east coast.

There are more heart attack deaths in the U.S. between the week -- during the week between Christmas and New Year's than compared to any other week of the year. The deadliest day, December 25. That is followed by December 26. And then, ranking third, January 1.

So I've never heard of this, so let's bring in Dr. Gregory Janis. He's a cardiologist at NYU Langone Health.

So, Dr. Janis, why is this -- why is this week of the year so dangerous?

DR. GREGORY S. JANIS, CARDIOLOGIST, NYU LANGONE HEALTH: Well, it's really unclear as to exactly why the mechanism of heart attack is strongest during this time of the year, but there's a lot of theories as to -- as to why. Many different things are contributing to it we think. We're not -- the scientific evidence isn't pointing exactly towards a specific thing but it's probably a conglomeration of things.

WILD: And what are some of those things? I mean, the weather is bad, you're probably drinking a lot, not eating very healthy, family stress. Are those some of the main risk factors? How do these things that are sort of going on externally impact your internal health?

JANIS: I mean, you took the words right out of my mouth right there.

So, we often deviate from our normal routines during this time of year, whether we are not exercising as much or we are not sleeping as well. And then there's always the stress and the anxiety that the holidays always bring. And whether it's about money, or your family, or about your jobs, the stress and anxiety of things certainly play a role.

And I absolutely think that the overindulgence in alcohol and sodium play a big role. The more we drink, the more sodium we have, the more unhealthy we are, and the more we have a tendency to ignore our health at that time. WILD: So what are the warning signs for a heart attack? And is it true that the warning signs are not totally similar for -- or not totally the same for men and women? That they might present a little bit differently?

[05:45:00]

JANIS: Yes, that has definitely always been the case.

The classic symptom of chest discomfort, chest pain, chest pressure -- however you are going to describe it -- is something that is not always what happens, particularly during the holidays. But usually, it's chest pain or chest pressure. Discomfort is brought on by exertion and relieved by rest.

But shortness of breath can often be a symptom that people present with.

And another way that -- especially during the holidays -- that's often misdiagnosed is when people think they have indigestion. Whether it be heartburn, or abdominal pain, or something anywhere in this region that is unusual for you, particularly if it persists and particularly if it's associated with feeling sweaty or just unwell and persists over any period of time, it's something to pay attention to and to seek treatment for immediately.

WILD: What should you do at the immediate onset of a suspected heart attack? What can you do at home? I mean, is this the kind of thing you take aspirin? You've called 911 and you're waiting for the paramedics to arrive, and then what do you do?

JANIS: Well, chewing two baby aspirin is definitely one of the ways to get a quick dose of a blood thinner into your system. And you are in the throws of a heart attack due to a blood clot that is causing your symptoms, this can help mitigate the way -- the heart attack and make it less severe. That is for sure.

And it's just about getting care immediately. I can't stress enough how important it is to seek medical care if there is any distress or any type of symptom that you are particularly worried about.

WILD: All right, Dr. Gregory Janis. Thank you.

JANIS: Thank you very much. Thank you for having me.

WILD: Coming up on "CNN THIS MORNING," flu season hit especially hard this year. Why experts warn that it could spike once again.

And next, right here on EARLY START, holiday gifts delayed by bad weather. So it's not just you, it's everybody.

(COMMERCIAL)

[05:50:32]

WILD: Welcome back to EARLY START. Maybe it was the perfect excuse, maybe it was the worst-case scenario -- but either way, a lot of packages did not come in time for Christmas because this huge Christmas blizzard just decimated the supply chain.

So let's bring in CNN Business reporter Nathaniel Meyersohn. Nathaniel, so what actually happened on the ground? Was it air travel? Was it -- was it rail? Was it trucking? Either way, I mean, the storm had an impact on Christmas gift orders.

NATHANIEL MEYERSOHN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Right, Whitney. So, this storm could not have come at a worse time for those last-minute Christmas gifts.

UPS had to shut its hubs in Kentucky and Illinois. FedEx had to shut hubs in Memphis and Indianapolis -- and FedEx is based in Memphis, so a huge hit there. The Postal Service had to close 89 facilities. And Amazon shut down deliveries in some of the areas impacted by the storm. So we're really focusing on those hubs -- delivery hubs that get you your deliveries.

And this is, of course, the busiest time of the year for these -- for these companies, so it couldn't have come at a worse time. And then, we also think about the stores and malls that had to close because of the storm. So let's hope that they're able to make up some of these deliveries this week as conditions get better, and stores can reopen.

But again, a huge hit to those last-minute deliveries and shopping season.

WILD: But it's hard because if the gift comes after Christmas -- like, what's the point in giving it, right? I mean, who wants a Lego set sitting around for the next six months until a birthday or something?

So, the problem is people might want to return that stuff and now stores are actually charging customers for returning those items online. So what can you tell us about that?

MEYERSOHN: Right. So you may have to return some of those items and that's bad news for stores. So we love free online returns because we can order anything and then bring it back. But the stores and companies hate it because it winds up back on their shelves or in their warehouses.

And we returned $816 billion in merchandise last year, so stores are saying we've had enough. Zara, H&M, Abercrombie -- they're all starting to charge for free online returns, and other companies are shortening their return windows. So, stores are saying we've had enough.

WILD: All right, Nathaniel Meyersohn. Thank you.

A deadly winter storm leaving thousands of Americans without power and many more with their holiday travel plans ruined. The areas hardest hit ahead on "CNN THIS MORNING." (COMMERCIAL)

[05:56:27]

WILD: Tom Brady delivers a Christmas Day comeback as the Buccaneers rally to beat the Cardinals in overtime.

Carolyn Manno has more in this morning's Bleacher Report. Carolyn, how did he do it?

CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Whitney.

You know what? There were a few times on Christmas night where Tom Brady looked more like the Grinch than the man in red. We've seen the quarterback cast as a pretty frustrated figure on the sidelines a few times already this season.

But in the end, in his 331st start, he put on the show that we've come to expect. How'd he do it? Because he's Tom Brady. He always does it.

It was a pretty -- it was not really a pretty game by his standards. He threw a pair of interceptions to Marco Wilson in regulation -- the second one coming while the game was tied at six in the third quarter. And then, with eight minutes left in the fourth, the Buccaneers found themselves down 10 and Brady would go to work after that.

It was a third and goal situation. He found Rachaad White to cut the Cardinals' lead down to three. And then from there, Tampa Bay would force overtime. The 45-year-old quarterback looking like his old self. Brady ended up completing all six of his passes on a drive of 69 yards and then coming up clutch when it mattered the most.

Kicker Ryan Succop capping of Brady's 57th career game-winning drive as the Bucs keep their playoff hopes alive with a 19-16 win.

Elsewhere, the Dolphins taking on the Packers. It was 46 degrees at kickoff. And if it was, in fact, that cold, that's the coldest home game since 1989 for Miami. But that didn't seem to bother the Dolphins one bit early on.

Tua Tagovailoa finding Jaylen Waddle for the 84-yard touchdown in the opening quarter. Good luck catching that guy.

The second half, though, was all Packers. AJ Dillon running this one in for the score in the third quarter to tie the game up a 20.

And then in the fourth quarter, the Green Bay defense really came to life and they might have saved the Packers' season. They would pick off Tua three straight times, the final one coming with just about 90 seconds left, to seal the 26-20 win.

Jaire Alexander had one of those three interceptions. Listen to how he hilariously broke this down for us.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JAIRE ALEXANDER, GREEN BAY PACKERS CORNERBACK: So, I'm just lining up. I see number 10 motion over.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Alexander!

ALEXANDER: Hey, Jones!

I see number 10 coming across the field and I said oh, snap -- he fast. So I backed off. When I backed off, I seen him coming. He ran right in front of me and I was like wow, is he really overthrowing it? Huh?

Took it down the sidelines and turned it over to my God, and gave the football to a little kid wearing 23.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MANNO: Talk about painting a picture. We normally don't get that kind of description.

The game of the night in the NBA belonging to the Nuggets and the Suns. We're picking this one up in the fourth. Denver found themselves down two with 15 seconds to play. And then, Jamal Murray would find the lane to slam home the dunk and tie it up at 113.

So that meant overtime, and that's where Aaron Gordon would take flight, literally. I mean, check out these monster dunks. He's called for an offensive foul at first but that would be overturned. So he would make the free throws and the Nuggets would hold on to win this thrilled 128-125.

And look at this, Whitney. The Buffalo Bills had to spend Christmas morning in Chicago after their win on Saturday, but ended up flying into Rochester as the airport in Buffalo remained closed because of all that terrible weather that you've been talking about.

So the team was greeted by diehard Bills fans who made the trip out there. And then, when they took buses back to the facility at Orchard Park, they would come to find their vehicles buried under an incredible amount of snow.

This is Bills' safety Damar Hamlin documenting this crazy scene on Instagram. I think that they probably could have used a couple more shovels. But just wild to end after a game like this, Whitney, and then see your car completely buried in snow.

So week 16, a winter wonderland for sure. You had eight games kicking off with below-freezing temperatures on Saturday over the weekend.

Austria's stance on Schengen is surprising - Lipavsky in press

Vienna, Jan 5 (CTK) - The Austrian refusal of Romania and Bulgaria becoming members of the Schengen Area of free movement was quite sudden and surprising, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has told Der Standard Austrian daily.

He also expressed the belief that the Visegrad Four (V4; Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) would keep existing despite the fact that, for instance, the Hungarian stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine did not make the cooperation any easier.

In the interview, Lipavsky (Pirates) assessed the six-month the Czech EU presidency, which ended on December 31, 2022, and was mainly marked by the war in Ukraine. He noted that the invasion had completely disarranged all preparations as it was necessary to deal with problems in the area of energy policy and humanitarian, military and economical help for Ukraine.

Czechia also tried to push through its own priorities, such as the EU enlargement to the Western Balkans.

"I think it was a perceived very positively. We were also trying to enlarge the Schengen Area. Unfortunately, we only succeeded in this in the case of Croatia after Austria stood up against the admission of Romania at the very last moment," Lipavsky said, noting that this was rather unexpected as Austria had sent "completely different signals before."

He is of the view that the entry of Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen Area, or at least a realistic perspective of their early entry, would help strengthen security.

Lipavsky noted that the EU was a project in which various interests must be led to a common consensus. He said, however, the unity was very strong, supporting this by the examples of the nine sanction packages against Russia, a training mission for Ukrainian soldiers and financial aid to Ukraine.

Lipavsky said he was pleased by the achievement of passing the aid to Ukraine worth 18 billion euros although it required, for instance, to break the disagreement of Hungary. This was achieved by loosening the blocking of the EU money for it over the problems with the rule of law functioning in this country.

In this relation, Lipavsky dismissed that the different stances, for instance, of Poland and Hungary on Russia would threaten the existence of the VS.

"The Visegrad Group has existed for 30 years and I expect it to keep existing. However, the differing approaches concerning the Russian invasion of Ukraine naturally do not make the cooperation easier," he admitted.

He also praised the cooperation under the "Slavkov (Austerlitz) format," that is the meeting of the government representatives of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria.

"We understand each other and do not surprise each other," he said.

Iran regime terrorist spy operations spread in Austria - intel report

Austria is a “spy paradise” for Iran, Russia, China and Turkey because of weak criminal penalties for espionage.

Austria’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism released a new report in January, asserting Iran’s regime spread its nefarious spy activities[https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/germany-is-a-hotbed-of-iranian-spy-activity-that-targets-israel-488767] in the central European country and Austria is “attractive” for such bad actors as China, Russia, Iran and Turkey because of weak criminal penalties for espionage.

According to the report dated for the year 2021, “Over the years, the network of Iranian intelligence services[https://www.jpost.com/international/article-721211] has also spread in Austria. For civil domestic and foreign surveillance, the Ministry of Information (MOIS) is responsible. The military home and foreign intelligence services emerge from the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard (and is referred to as IRGC-IO – Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Intelligence Organization). The military special unit Quds Force also plays a not insignificant role, which, in addition to extraterritorial military operations, is specialized in obtaining intelligence information.”

The US government classified the IRGC a foreign terrorist organization in 2019. The European Parliament last week voted for a non-binding resolution to sanction the IRGC as a terrorist entity[https://www.jpost.com/international/article-729066]. The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said on Monday the EU needs a court ruling[https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-729315] that declares the IRGC engages in terrorist activities before the 125,000 military force can be proscribed a terrorist organization.

The Austrian intelligence report said cyber espionage[https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-716592] in Austria was largely carried out by Russia, China and Iran.

In sharp contrast to previous reports that largely ignored Shi’ite terrorist and espionage activities from Iran, the new report devoted analysis to the Islamic Republic.

According to the intelligence document, foreign spy services find it “attractive” to operate on Austrian national territory because of “the very low threat of punishment. “The report noted the Austrian intelligence services have, in contrast to European services, weak intelligence gathering powers.”

Austria is also a hotbed of spy activity, according to the report, because of its “good geo-political situation” and location of a number of international organizations, as well as the economic strength of the Alpine county.

The Austrian Economic Chambers reported on it that in “the first half of 2022, Austria exported goods worth 98.1 million euros to Iran – an increase of +113.1% compared to the same period of the previous year.”

The business group added that “In the year as a whole, Austria exported goods worth 117.8 million euros to Iran (+17.6% compared to the previous year).”

Is Austria a spying paradise?

Espionage in Austria takes place under the disguise of diplomacy in foreign embassies and consulates, noted the report. Spies for foreign nationals also operate “in clubs, cultural centers, press agencies, airlines or other business locations,” wrote the Austrian intelligence officials.

“Austria is a spy paradise,” headlined the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation in its article on the new intelligence report.

Austria is an important location for Turkey’s MIT intelligence service because the large community of people of “Turkish origin” in Austria, noted the intelligence agency report.

“The main focus of the Turkish intelligence services is particularly focused on critics of the regime and opponents and to clarify the Gülen movement and the PKK, since these are classified by the Turkish government as extremist or terrorist,” said the intelligence report.

China’s spy operation, according to the report, is dedicated to the collection of information on the “military capabilities of foreign military forces” as well to securing ”military-related scientific and technological information.”

The Austrian report said that Russian intelligence has been operating unchanged in Austria with “high intensity” for “some time.” The Russian espionage operation targets “the recruitment of employees in institutions of special interest to the Russian Federation.”

BP expects to approve the final investment decision for three green hydrogen projects in Europe by the end of 2023, a company official told S&P Global Commodity Insights Jan. 18.

"We are looking to sanction projects for the delivery of hydrogen to our European refineries, across Spain, Germany and Netherlands," Felipe Arbelaez, senior vice president for hydrogen and CCS, said on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week in Abu Dhabi.

"So, you will be looking at an about 18-to-24 months period" to finalize the projects, which will be phased, with volumes varying site by site but being roughly in the 100 MW range," he added.

BP's European refineries are located in clusters, such as Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Valencia Valley in Spain, where hydrogen demand is high in its own operations as well as among its partners and industrial participants that will be able to utilize green hydrogen, he added. The company is looking at hydrogen projects in Europe with distribution systems that can easily transport hydrogen to customers, he added. BP announced Jan. 16 it would examine the construction of a hydrogen hub in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, converting imported green ammonia back into hydrogen.

CONVENTIONAL UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** Poland's PKN Orlen said Jan. 20 it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil products loading terminal in Gdansk. PKN said both investments are scheduled to be commissioned by mid-2025. The hydrocracking base oils project will help the company diversify into second- and third-generation base oils.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** The expansion of Orlen Unipetrol's steam cracker at Litvinov is still ongoing, the company said Dec. 2022. The company said in October 2021 it was contracting Technip Energies to build a new steam cracker furnace to be commissioned in 2022. The construction of an 11th furnace is set to boost production capacity to 585,000 mt/year of ethylene from 545,000 mt/year. The company plans to increase total petrochemical production capacity to 1.4 million mt/year by 2030 from 900,000 mt/year.

PKN Orlen has completed the Czech Koruna 9.6 billion ($410 million) polyethylene 3 unit investment at Litvinov. The refinery's owner, Unipetrol, a 100%-owned PKN subsidiary, has taken charge of the black polyethylene unit, the second part of the investment. The first part, the natural polyethylene unit, was completed in April 2020. The polyethylene 3 unit, which can produce 270,000 mt/year of high density polyethylene, will replace production of one of the two existing production units with a capacity of 120,000 mt/year. Litvinov's polyethylene capacity will increase from 320,000 mt/year to 470,000 mt/year. PKN Orlen was launching construction of a unit at Litvinov to produce up to 26,000 mt/year of dicyclopentadiene, or DCPC, used in the automotive, construction and electronic industries. Separately, McDermott International has been awarded a contract for engineering, procurement and construction management services for an upgrade of the hydrocracker at the Litvinov refinery.

** Motor Oil Hellas has approved an investment into a new propylene splitter unit at the Corinth refinery. It will have 100,000 mt annual capacity and is expected to be completed by 2026. It will use the existing infrastructure of the FCC unit which will switch part of the gasoline production into propylene. The splitter is a "significant step" towards diversifying the refinery operations, the company said.

** Croatia's Rijeka refinery halted operations for five months between November 2022 and April 2023 while it continues with its upgrade project. During the shutdown, works will be carried out on "connecting existing units with new systems", the company said. The company also clarified that "several suspensions" of operations are planned for the duration of the upgrade project, in which it is investing more than HRK4 billion ($524 million), as "the refinery cannot operate continuously while work is being carried out" on the existing and new units. The upgrade involves construction of a new residue complex, which includes a delayed coker. Works on the new residue complex started in 2020 after a final investment decision in 2019. The commissioning of the new complex is planned for 2024, the company said.

** France's Donges refinery is building a new hydrodesulfurization unit due to start up in the fourth quarter of 2023.

** OMV Petrom will build a new unit for aromatics products at its Petrobrazi refinery. The company said it will invest approximately EUR130 million on the new unit whose processing capacity will be around 1,500 mt/d of reformed gasoline. The existing aromatics unit, which was put in production in 1961, will be replaced between 2023-2025, and the new unit will be put in operation in 2026. OMV also said it has "successfully completed the transportation of four coke drums." The new drums will replace the current ones, which have been in use since 1989, and will be operational in 2023. The company is also considering other significant investments at Petrobrazi, "both in the technological efficiency of the refinery as well as in the production of second-generation biofuels," the company said.

** Repsol will build a new plant to produce 15,000 mt/year of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) at Puertollano. The plant, which should be operational in 2024, will be the first of its kind in Spain to produce the "super polymer," known for its high tenacity and high impact resistance.

** Repsol will build a new plant at Tarragona to produce 27,000 mt/year of cross-linkable polyethylene (XLPE) from mid-2024. It will also invest Eur18 million in an upgrade of its polyols unit, due to conclude in Q4 2023.

** Bosnia's Brod refinery has started construction of a bitumen unit. The refinery, which has been offline since 2019 for an upgrade, had been expected to restart once it was connected to a gas pipeline, allowing it to switch to gas-fired power operations. The line was connected in December 2021, but the plant remains offline. The owner has not given a reason why. A solar power facility at the plant has also been built to help power operations.

** Slovakia's Slovnaft is modernizing and expanding polypropylene production at the Bratislava refinery. The capacity of the PP3 unit will increase by 33,000 mt/year to 300,000 mt/year. Construction was expected to start in the summer of 2023 and complete in October 2024.

** Poland's PKN Orlen has signed a contract with Linde to build a new oxygen and nitrogen production unit at its Plock refinery. The unit will produce 38,500 cu m/hour of oxygen and 75,000 cu m/hour of nitrogen, supplying gas feedstock for the new Olefin III complex and other installations at Plock. The project is due to be completed by the start of 2025.

** A visbreaking unit at PKN's Plock refinery will have a capacity to produce 200,000 mt/year of diesel. Ongoing modernization of the hydrocracking and diesel hydrodesulfurization units at Plock will also increase the refinery's diesel production capacity. Separately, PKN Orlen has bought a license and base design from US engineering company KBR for a potential bottom-of-the-barrel project. If PKN takes a final investment decision, it will construct a production complex using solvent de-asphalting and fluid catalytic cracking technologies.

** Romania's Rompetrol expects the new cogeneration plant at the Petromidia refinery to be online by July 2023. The Kazakh-Romanian Energy Investment Fund, or FIEKR, has raised Eur83 million syndicated credit facility for financing the project, which represents over 65% of the overall investment, estimated at $148 million. In 2020, the fund signed an engineering, procurement and construction contract for Turkey's Calik Enerji to build the cogeneration plant, and in June 2021, it started the execution of the contract. The new facility will be fueled mainly by natural gas and up to 25% by the fuel gas from refining technological processes. Its efficiency will reach 92%. It will have 80 MW capacity, out of which the largest amount will be used to cover Petromidia's electricity needs, and the rest will be used to heat water for the town of Navodari's heating system. In 2020, two other projects were approved which aimed at modernizing the Petromidia refinery. They comprised building a diesel dewaxing unit which will allow the refinery to improve the production of winter diesel and increase the production of special aviation fuel. In addition, the refinery is working on increasing by more than 30% its polymer production by converting the high density polyethylene installation into a polypropylene installation.

** Azerbaijan's state oil company Socar is looking to expand the capacity of its 212,000 b/d Star refinery in Turkey. Socar said it could expand Star's capacity to 13 million mt/year (261,000 b/d) by means of "flexibilities" in the refinery's design.

** PKN Orlen has signed an EPC contract with UK-based Petrofac to build a bottom-of-the-barrel unit at its Mazeikiu refinery in Lithuania. The unit is expected to be completed by the end of 2024 and will allow a rise in the production of high-margin products to 86% of the total, from 73%.

** Turkish construction group Tekfen Insaat said that together with partner HMB Hallesche Mitteldeutsche Bau it has signed an EPC contract with Turkey's main refiner Tupras to construct a new sulfur recovery unit at the Kirikkale refinery. Tupras' upgrade plans for its four refineries include new sulfur units at its three main refineries, Izmit, Izmir and Kirikkale. Tupras is also carrying out a revamp of the FCC unit at Izmit, which will include the installation of flue gas treatment and energy back recovery systems.

** Portugal's Galp will build a desulfurization unit with a processing capacity of 20,000 b/d at the Sines refinery. The project will allow the company to widen its crude slate.

** Greece's Hellenic Petroleum said in 2021 that Eur35 million had been approved for a capacity increase at the polypropylene production unit at Thessaloniki to 300,000 mt/year, with the implementation targeted within two-and-a-half years.

** Serbia's Pancevo refinery expects to complete its FCC project by 2023. The refinery also plans to build a unit to produce the octane enhancement chemical ETBE by 2024.

** Bulgaria's Burgas refinery has awarded a contract to US Lummus Technology for a 280,000 mt/year polypropylene plant. The contract includes a technology license as well as basic design engineering, training and services, and catalyst supply.

** ExxonMobil said it has "made a final investment decision to expand" the Fawley refinery in the UK to increase production of ultra low sulfur diesel by 45%, or 38,000 b/d. The more than $1 billion investment includes a hydrotreater to remove sulfur from diesel, supported by a hydrogen plant.

** Israel's Haifa District Court has rejected an appeal by Haifa municipality along with six other neighboring communities and environmental groups against the proposed expansion of the Bazan refinery.

BIOFUEL, HYDROGEN UPGRADES

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Operator Cepsa said Dec. 2022 it concluded a year-and-a-half conversion project at one of its idled units at the Huelva refinery to increase first and second-generation biofuels, which reduce CO2 emissions by 90%. The refurbished desulfurization unit will produce a sustainable diesel known as hydrotreated biodiesel, which is made from vegetable oil, vegetable waste, and animal fats not used for human consumption.

The new unit will initially produce 400 mt/d of hydrotreated biodiesel which can be eventually doubled to 800 mt/d. Cepsa started production of advanced 2G biofuels at the Huelva site in October 2022, using cooking oils as feedstock. The company has started to orient its two southwest Spain refineries to boost the output of sustainable fuel. Cepsa plans to hit annual production of 2.5 million mt of advanced biofuels by 2030, including 800,000 mt/yr of sustainable aviation fuel.

Huelva and Cepsa's other refinery at nearby Algeciras are also targeting 2 GW of green hydrogen electrolyzer capacity with an investment of Eur3 billion. Cepsa has already signed an agreement with the Port of Rotterdam to create the first green hydrogen corridor between southern and northern Europe, allowing the export of green ammonia and methanol.

The Huelva plant will start up in 2026, reaching full capacity in 2028, while the Algeciras facility will be operational in 2027. Cepsa is already working on the engineering and administrative processing of the project.

** Renewable hydrogen company Everfuel has signed an agreement in Jan. 2023 to supply oxygen to an undisclosed company from its HySynergy electrolyzer in Fredericia, Denmark, enabling a higher utilization of the plant. The conditional agreement will improve the overall utilization and efficiency of the second phase of the electrolyzer, providing a long-term revenue stream, Everfuel said. HySynergy 2.0 will extend the existing 20 MW electrolyzer with 300 MW of additional capacity by 2025. It will be developed with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia and will produce hydrogen to decarbonize industrial processes and transportation. The first 20-MW phase started hydrogen production in December, with first commercial deliveries due in 2023. The plant, adjacent to the Fredericia oil refinery, will supply renewable hydrogen to the facility and for local zero-emissions transport, Everfuel said. The plant will send 80% of the hydrogen produced to the refinery for use as a feedstock in the refining process. The remaining 20% will go to hydrogen mobility applications. Phase two is to be built in three 100-MW stages.

** Neste has received a grant of Eur27.7 million ($29 million) for green hydrogen projects at its Porvoo refinery in Finland, the company said in late December 2022. The funding from Business Finland was approved under the EU's Important Projects of Common European Interest scheme, clearing the way for state support. Neste had said it was targeting a final investment decision in late 2023 for its 'Sustainable Hydrogen and Recovery of Carbon' project at Porvoo. The project includes a 50-MW electrolyzer to produce 8,000 mt/year of renewable hydrogen, along with a carbon capture plant that will capture 300,000-400,000 mt/year of CO2 from the company's existing hydrogen production unit, Neste told S&P Global Commodity Insights. Neste plans to switch around a quarter of its Porvoo hydrogen production to low-carbon sources with these developments, out of annual demand of over 100,000 mt.

Separately Neste said it has launched a study to transition its Porvoo refinery "to non-crude oil refining and into a globally leading renewable and circular solutions site." The transformation could see the end of crude refining at Porvoo in the mid-2030s. Through benefiting from "available refining assets, experience and know-how, Neste targets to significantly grow its renewables and circular production in Porvoo long term," Neste said. The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste will also build a chemical recycling facility at its Porvoo refinery. The project aims to pretreat and upgrade liquefied waste plastic and integrate the technologies into the refinery operations. It targets 400,000 mt/year pretreatment capacities "contributing to Neste's goal of processing over 1 million mt of waste plastic per year from 2030 onward." The investment decision was targeted for 2023 and gradual implementation expected to start in 2024. Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

** Spain's Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for its planned 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

Other projects include a 2,100 mt/yr synthetic fuel plant and supporting hydrogen infrastructure to come online from 2024.

A separate plant, costing Eur20 million is contemplated to generate gas to feed the refinery from urban waste and should be online by 2025.

** Piling work for a new biofuel plant being built by Shell at the site of Europe's biggest refinery, Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam (formerly Pernis), was due to be completed around summer 2023, with the new plant expected to start up in 2024 or 2025. Shell is building an 820,000 mt/year biofuel plant in Rotterdam to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste. The facility will not use virgin palm oil as a feedstock although it will process vegetable oils, such as rapeseed, to supplement the waste feedstocks "until even more sustainable advanced feedstocks are widely available," it said.

** Repsol along with Spanish companies Naturgy and Reganosa plan to construct a hydrogen electrolyzer at Meirama, close to the A Coruna plant, with the output used to feed the refinery. The first phase of the project will see 30 MW of installed capacity by 2025 at the site of a closed thermal power plant. A subsequent upgrade will take the project to 200 MW capacity, producing 30,000 mt of green hydrogen per year. A newly installed hydrotreatment unit at Spain's A Coruna that processes vegetable and cooking oils was expected to boost biofuel output by 5,500 mt/year in 2022, with the volume rising to 10,500 mt/year by 2024.

** Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery. The contract covers engineering, procurement and construction assistance for the conversion of Grandpuits "into a zero-crude platform oriented towards SAF," it said. Once in operation, the facility will have the capacity to produce 210,000 mt/year of SAF from sustainable feedstock such as used cooking oil and animal fat. Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in Q1 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform, starting in 2024.

Separately, Air Liquide is to invest over Eur130 million ($134 million) in a low-carbon hydrogen unit at the Grandpuits biorefinery. TotalEnergies has committed to buy the hydrogen under a long-term contract to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The new reforming unit, with capacity to produce over 20,000 mt/year of hydrogen, will partly recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, in place of the natural gas it normally uses.

TotalEnergies also said that its zero-crude project at Grandpuits "is based on the development of several future-oriented activities" which include chemical recycling of plastic waste, production of biosourced and biodegradable bioplastics, production of biofuels for the aviation sector, construction of a solar farm and electricity storage by batteries. The new units will be starting up from 2022 and are expected to be operational by 2025.

** Turkey's Tupras said it had completed basic engineering studies to produce sustainable aviation fuel at its Izmir refinery using Honeywell's UOP ecofining technology. Tupras said it plans eventually to produce 400,000 mt/year of SAF, renewable diesel and other products at Izmir.

** Croatia's INA is studying various options for its Sisak refinery, including a biorefinery, biogas plant and production of pure hydrogen.

** Italy's Eni said it was "investigating the opportunity to build a new bio-refinery at Eni's industrial site in Livorno." It will be Eni's third biorefinery in Italy after converting its Gela and Venice refineries into biofuel plants. Eni said its feasibility study involves building "three new plants for the production of hydrogenated biofuel: a biogenic feedstock pre-treatment unit, a 500,000 mt/year Ecofining plant and a plant for the production of hydrogen from methane gas." The design of the three plants will be completed by 2023 and construction by 2025. Local officials welcomed the potential conversion of the Livorno refinery into a biorefinery as it would maintain "the current workforce and the entire production chain."

** Italy's Eni has started producing SAF at its Taranto refinery in southern Italy, as part of its commitment to decarbonize all its products and processes by 2050. Eni plans to increase its bio-refining capacity to 5 million-6 million mt/year by 2050. Eni targets its SAF capacity to reach at least 500,000 mt/year by 2030. Eni said its SAF production will continue to grow with the start-up of over 10,000 mt/year of SAF from its Livorno refinery using bio-components produced in Eni's existing Gela and Venice bio-refineries. In 2024, Eni plans to launch SAF production at the Gela bio-refinery, where a project is underway for a further 150,000 mt/year of SAF production from 100% renewable raw materials by 2025.

** Italy's Eni said that it will install a 20 MW electrolyzer at its Gela biorefinery and a 10 MW electrolyzer at its Taranto refinery. The electrolyzers will be part of a project to develop green hydrogen by Enel Green Power and Eni which will receive public funding approved by the European Commission.

** Finland's Neste said that the Rotterdam expansion project is "on track with the majority of the equipment purchases already done." The company has taken the final investment decision to expand renewable fuels production capacity in Rotterdam by 1.3 million mt/year to 2.7 million mt/year, with sustainable aviation fuel accounting for 1.2 million mt/year. The new production unit is set to be started up in the first half of 2026. The expansion at the Singapore facility is approaching mechanical completion and is proceeding according to schedule for targeted startup at the end of Q1 2023. Neste's current production capacity for renewable products is 3.3 million mt/year which is set to increase to 5.5 million mt/year by the end of 2023 due to the expansion at Singapore and the Martinez joint venture. When completed, the Rotterdam expansion project will further increase the total capacity to 6.8 million mt/year by the end of 2026.

** Ineos has awarded a design contract for a planned 190,000 mt/year low-carbon hydrogen production plant at its Grangemouth refining and petrochemical site in Scotland to engineering company Atkins. The plant is expected to be operational by 2030.

** Essar, the owner of the UK's Stanlow refinery, said it has received a hydrogen-powered furnace, which is the first in the UK. The furnace has been commissioned by Essar Oil UK "as it transitions to run its operations on hydrogen as part of HyNet, the UK's leading decarbonization cluster," it said. The furnace, which will run on 100% hydrogen fuel from 2026, "forms a central part of Essar's strategy at Stanlow to become the UK's first low-carbon refinery." The furnace will replace three gas-fired furnaces at the plant's crude distillation unit. Essar is also developing 300,000 cu m of biofuel storage capacity at the site, allowing customers to store, blend and distribute biofuels for the road, aviation and marine sectors. It will become the UK's largest biofuels storage facility when completed.

** Spain's Castellon will install a 60-MW hydrogen unit for a 2024 start-up with options to expand thereafter, BP Espana said. The start date has been pushed back from a previous 2023 target. The refinery also has plans to triple SAF output to 15,000 b/d as part of an overall decarbonization program, according to press reports.

** OMV Petrom will start producing SAF at its Petrobrazi refinery, which will become the first refinery in Romania to produce the fuel. The refinery will produce SAF by coprocessing locally produced rapeseed oil. In the future, it aims to increase the production capacities and produce sustainable fuels based on various waste feedstocks, such as used cooking oil. "Our goal is that, in 2030, to have an annual combined production of SAF and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil) of about 450 thousand tons," Radu Caprau, member of the Executive Board responsible for Refining & Marketing said.

** Repsol and partners Enerkem and Agbar have presented a project to transform 400,000 mt/year of urban waste to 220,000 mt/year methanol at Tarragona, which should start up in 2025 with an investment of Eur250 million. Spain's Tarragona has started on a series of energy transition projects, including the manufacture of biofuel for aviation and an advanced biofuels plant, which is already under construction. The refinery plans to build a 100-MW hydrogen electrolyzer by 2025.

** Gunvor is preparing to build a biofuel factory at its Rotterdam refinery, which will convert vegetable and animal oils, and fat into 700,000 mt/year of renewable diesel, according to local media reports. The plant will comprise pre-treatment unit and hydrogenation installation consisting of two units each with around 350,000 mt/year capacity. The new units will be located on the site of the former lubricants facility. Gunvor has been studying the potential installation of an HVO unit at the Rotterdam facility. Gunvor's Rotterdam refinery shut two crude processing units, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, and is developing new processes. Separately, Gunvor has agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe from December 2021, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Hungarian oil and gas group MOL will build a 10-MW electrolyzer for renewable hydrogen production at its Danube refinery in Szazhalombatta, Hungary. The electrolyzers from US company Plug Power will produce 1,600 mt/year of green hydrogen, with operations starting in 2023.

** OMV said that together with AEG Fuels it will supply SAF from its Schwechat refinery on-demand for the "general aviation segment" to be used as an alternative to conventional jet fuel at the Vienna International Airport. SAF is produced at Schwechat by co-processing Austrian used cooking oil and is supplied via a direct pipeline connection to Vienna's international airport. OMV had also supplied the first batch of SAF to Vienna International Airport for fueling Austrian Airlines aircraft. Schwechat has received the two main components for producing SAF -- the reactor and column. From mid-2023 up to 160,000 mt of liquid biomass will be converted into SAF using an innovative co-processing method, it said. "The new reactor will process substances including vegetable oil together with other feedstocks in a procedure known as co-processing. This innovative process involves refining the biogenic feedstock via a hydrogenation process using hydrogen," OMV said. In the future, the process can be used for processing other feedstock such as used cooking oil or advanced bio-fuels. OMV plans to increase its SAF sales to more than 700,000 mt/year by 2030. Separately, OMV will build the country's largest electrolysis plant at the Schwechat refinery through a joint investment with Kommunalkredit Austria AG. The plant is expected to start in H2 2023. The 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis will produce up to 1,500 mt/year of green hydrogen.

** The UK's Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways and has announced a joint venture to develop retail hydrogen fueling stations in Europe. British Airways and Phillips 66 signed a multi-year supply agreement that will provide the airline with SAF produced at the Humber refinery. The SAF will be produced from sustainable waste feedstock at the Humber Refinery, which will deliver its SAF supply to British Airways via existing pipeline infrastructure that feeds directly into UK airports. Phillips 66 said it secured more than GBP500,000 to switch industrial fired heaters from gas to low carbon hydrogen at its Humber refinery. The company is working with the UK's Gigastack consortium on a project that involves the use of renewable hydrogen at Humber to reduce the carbon content of fuels produced there. Separately, Phillips 66 said its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Germany's Bayernoil is looking at producing SAF from sewage sludge. It could convert 100,000 mt of sewage sludge into SAF annually under Project Bayosine. The processing, which involves pyrolisis, can be done in a new unit at the Vohburg site of the plant.

** Sweden's Preem aims to expand the HVO capacity at its Gothenburg plant from 320,000 cu m/year to 1.3 million cu m/year in 2026. "This is planned to take place in a completely new facility designed to produce renewable vehicle fuels and aviation fuels with great flexibility," it said. In its Lysekil plant, production of HVO from the Synsat plant "was the highest to date," the company said. Preem is rebuilding the existing Synsat plant, so it can produce renewable raw materials and replace part of the fossil production. It is expected to reach renewable production capacity of 950,000 cu m/year by 2024.

** Finland's UPM expects its Leuna biorefinery in Germany to be operational by the end of 2023 and ramp up in 2024. Construction of the facility, which will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals, started in 2020. Its total annual capacity will be 220,000 mt bio-monoethylene glycol and lignin-based renewable functional fillers. It will also produce monopropylene glycol and industrial sugars made from sustainably harvested beechwood sourced regionally in Germany.

** Greece's Motor Oil Hellas said its Corinth refinery by 2030 aims to enhance its pure hydrogen infrastructure through demonstration and scale-up of green hydrogen. In the long term, it aims to be a "large producer of clean hydrogen".

** BP plans to install a hydrogen unit at Spain's Castellon for a 2023 start-up, in conjunction with Spain's Iberdrola and Enagas. The refinery also plans to triple SAF output to 15,000 b/d, according to a February report in Castellon Plaza, citing Andres Geuvara de la Vega.

** France's TotalEnergies said it has "successfully started production" of SAF at its Gonfreville refinery in Normandy. The new site complements the biojet production capacities of the company's La Mede refinery and the Oudalle plant. All the biojet will be supplied to French airports and will be produced from waste and residue sourced from the circular economy. La Mede, in the south of France, and Oudalle, near Le Havre, began producing SAF in April 2021. La Mede stopped processing crude oil at the end of 2016 and was converted into a bio plant in 2019.

** Repsol's Cartagena has started construction of its planned second-generation biofuel plant at the nearby to the refinery Escombreras facility, which should result in the production of 250,000 mt/year of biodiesel from waste from mid-2023. The company will invest Eur200 million in the project that would output biodiesel, biojet, bionaphtha and biopropane, allowing an overall CO2 reduction of 900,000 mt/year. As part of its drive to decarbonize the refinery, Repsol also plans to build a 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer at Cartagena, with a target date of 2025.

** PKN Orlen said its subsidiary Orlen Poludnie has signed an agreement to build a "complex of units for production of II generation bioethanol" at its biofuel refinery in Jedlicze, southern Poland. The B2G complex will include a main unit for bioethanol production and will have the capacity to produce 25,000 mt/year of bioethanol from biomass. In the next stage, a biogas plant will be built. The biomass will be mainly cereals straw sourced from Polish farmers. The bioethanol complex will also include a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant, which will generate heat for bioethanol production. The Jedlicze refinery is a small former petroleum refinery, which together with the Trzebinia refinery, was incorporated into Orlen Poludnie, the company's biofuels subsidiary.

** Poland's PKN Orlen is constructing a hydrogen plant at its Poludnie biorefinery in Trzebinia. Annual production will be 16 million cu m, and three-quarters of that will be used to produce glycol. The remainder will be used to produce 45 kg/h of fuel-grade hydrogen for use in transport.

** Orsted and BP are to jointly develop a 50 MW renewable hydrogen project at BP's Lingen refinery in Germany. The project, expected to be operational in 2024, would comprise a 50 MW electrolyzer capable of generating 9,000 mt/year of hydrogen, 20% of the refinery's current fossil-based hydrogen consumption. The electrolyzer is expected to be powered by an Orsted North Sea offshore wind farm. The partners have a longer-term ambition to build more than 500 MW of renewable hydrogen capacity at Lingen, providing renewable hydrogen to meet all the refinery's hydrogen demand and provide feedstock for future synthetic fuel production.

** Portugal's Galp is targeting a final investment decision on its planned 100-MW Sines hydrogen production plant in Q1 2023, CEO Andy Brown said. Brown said Galp was also "just about" to take FID on a first stage 2-MW electrolyzer pilot project at Sines. Galp's own 100-MW Sines electrolyzer project will focus on its refinery there, with a target to replace existing conventional hydrogen production. "We can go to 600 MW to actually replace all our grey [hydrogen] with green," and with the possibility of converting the renewable hydrogen to ammonia, "it becomes a complete system," Brown said. Previously, Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub which Galp expects to be leveraged on the access to green hydrogen. This will allow further industrial applications, such as synthetic fuel, and support a significant emissions reduction by 2030. The upgrade could entail a 270,000 mt/year HVO production site, on which Galp has to take a final investment decision.

** Italian energy company Eni and SEA, the operator of Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, have signed an agreement to supply SAF for commercial flights, as a step towards accelerating the "ecological transition" of the two airports. Eni plans to develop Eni Biojet which will be made "exclusively" from used cooking oil or animal fats and can be "used in a blend with conventional jet fuel of up to 50%," Umberto Carrara, Director of Green/Traditional Refining and Market at Eni said. The company plans to produce around 200,000 mt/year by 2024 and double the production by 2030.

** BP has partnered with Dutch green hydrogen company HyCC to develop its 250-MW H2-Fifty electrolyzer project in Rotterdam. The companies will next select a technology partner for the previously announced renewable hydrogen project and begin environmental studies, with a final investment decision expected in 2023. The project is expected to come online in 2025. The renewable hydrogen produced at the facility will replace fossil-based feedstock at BP's Rotterdam refinery and other industries in the area. The plant will be situated in the Maasvlakte area of Rotterdam.

** Russia's Lukoil said in December 2021 that it has signed memorandum of intent with Rusatom Overseas, part of the Rosatom Group, to cooperate in the production and supply of green hydrogen for the company's Petrotel refinery in Ploesti, Romania.

** Varo Energy's Cressier refinery in Switzerland will use solar panel generated electricity by 19,000 photovoltaic panels for a "significant portion" of the electricity it consumes. Varo Energy Group and Groupe E will build the "most powerful ground-mounted solar facility in Switzerland" with an installed capacity of 7.7 MW. It will be built in the industrial zone east of the refinery. At full power the park will be able to supply more than 60% of the refinery's needs.

** ExxonMobil, Macquarie's Green Investment Group, and SGN are studying the potential for a low-carbon hydrogen hub centered around ExxonMobil's Fawley refinery on the UK's south coast. Initial hydrogen production could be around 4.3 TWh/year from 2030. Hydrogen demand in the Southampton industrial cluster around the refinery could reach 37 TWh by 2050.

** Italy's Saras is working on activating a green hydrogen plant for a total of 20 MW. Saras is building the green hydrogen plant with Italian utility Enel. The hydrogen produced would be used at the Sarroch refinery. It is currently provided by the IGCC complex and two reforming units on the industrial site.

** The Refhyne II consortium, developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for Shell's Rheinland refinery in Germany at its Wesseling site, has received a Eur32.4 million grant from the EU. The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Polish refiner PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million ($150 million) investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery. The unit will process used rapeseed oil to produce an additive to diesel or aviation fuel. The annual production of the unit will be 300,000 mt of biodiesel or aviation biofuel. The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies will stop using palm oil at La Mede from 2023. The biorefinery has already significantly reduced the amount of palm oil it processes from 500,000 mt/year initially to 100,000 mt/year in 2021. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

LAUNCHES

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Turkey's Ersan Petrol is still hopeful of its plans for a 1.4 million mt/year refinery at Kahramanmaras in southeast Turkey will be able to go ahead despite repeated delays and a difficult investment climate. Project coordinator Cenk Pala said Ersan was in talks with prospective partners and sources of finance for the project and hopes to start work on the FEED study this year. The refinery is planned for a 300,000 sq m site in Kahramanmaras which holds a defunct mini refinery that will be dismantled. A pre-feasibility study by Axens has defined the configuration and capacity of the plant which will produce mainly Euro 5 diesel, Euro 5 gasoline, jet and bitumen.

** A new greenfield Porto Romano refinery in Albania will be predominantly oriented to export markets but will also be able to cover Albania's domestic demand, Helmut Mayrhofer, consultant at Larkalis said. Austria-based consultancy Larkalis is leading an international consortium working on the project which will involve building the refinery in the port town of Durres. The refinery has a two-year construction authorization and could be commissioned by end-2025, depending on international developments.

** Azeri state oil company Socar is considering developing a second refinery in Turkey, in addition to its existing 214,000 b/d Star refinery at Aliaga on Turkey's central Aegean coast.

Austrian bank RBI needs more time for Russia plans despite Ukraine sanctions

Raiffeisen Bank International AG's planning around the future of its Russian business has not changed for now despite recent sanctions imposed by Ukraine, CEO Johann Strobl said.

Austria-based RBI is working "with quite a lot of manpower and external advice" to find a solution for its Russian business. All options are being considered, including a sale or deconsolidation, Strobl said during the bank's full-year 2022 earnings presentation Feb. 1.

"We permanently have to adjust," he said but did not give a time frame for a decision. "I can only assure you that we are working on the assessment of the options ... we have, and leaving Russia is one of the options," Strobl said.

A Russian leasing unit of RBI, which has the highest exposure to Russia among European banks, was put on a sanction list the Ukrainian government released Jan. 29.

RBI does not expect a major financial impact given that most of the unit's approximately €360 million leasing volume is linked to vehicles unlikely to be used in Ukrainian territory. The risk of repossession or confiscation is, therefore, "very small," Strobl said.

The group will nonetheless closely monitor future sanction risks in Ukraine as the issue has brought renewed attention to RBI's business in Russia, the CEO said. "For the first time, an RBI entity is sanctioned, and one has to observe and analyze what it could mean," he said.

Russian countersanctions have made the sale of Western ban subsidiaries in the country, including RBI's unit Joint Stock Company Raiffeisenbank, more difficult.

Reduced exposure

RBI's exposure to Russia fell to €16.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 from €22.6 billion in the third quarter, according to the bank's earnings report.

There is no obligation to recapitalize the Russian operations, and the loan portfolio in the country is expected to remain around current levels, the bank said. Loans to customers at RBI's Russian arm amounted to €8.99 billion as of Dec. 31, 2022, down from €11.64 billion a year ago.

The common equity Tier 1, or CET1, ratio for Russia was 27.14%, well above the minimum local capital requirement of 19.14%, RBI's records show. The group has strengthened its overall capitalization, with total transitional CET1 ratio, including retained earnings, standing at 16% as of the end of 2022.

Dividend outlook

RBI can afford to deconsolidate its Russian business while also paying a dividend on 2022 profits and making necessary repayments on subordinated instruments, bank records show. That would reduce total group CET1 ratio to 14%, above the 13.5% target the bank had set as a precondition for its zero price-to-book deconsolidation scenario for the Russian business, the records show.

Nevertheless, RBI will not rush to pay the €0.80 per share dividend it plans to propose for 2022, Strobl said. The timing of the final decision is "uncertain and unlikely to be made" at the annual general meeting on March 31, according to the bank's earnings statement. Approval by an extraordinary general meeting later in the year would depend on capital ratio development and "ongoing strategic considerations," RBI said.

Key earnings driver

The Russian unit has been by far the largest contributor to RBI's earnings in 2022, accounting for over 50% of the group's annual after-tax profit and about 40% of operating income. Yet, given the sanctions, the group cannot distribute profits from its Russian operations.

The Russian business was a key driver of RBI's operating performance in 2022, boosting group net interest income, or NII, and net fee and commission income, or NFCI, over the period. The business is expected to remain a major contributor to RBI's NII and NFCI in 2023, based on the group's current guidance.

RBI expects 2023 group NII of up to €4.7 billion, compared to €5.05 billion achieved in 2022. Excluding the businesses in Russia and Belarus, 2023 group NII would reach up to €3.4 billion, matching the 2022 result. Earnings from Belarus also cannot be distributed due to sanctions.

While the two units are driving earnings, they also account for higher operating and risk costs. Group operating expenses are expected to reach up to €3.7 billion in 2023, but excluding Russia and Belarus, expenses would drop to about €3 billion.

Neutrality and support for Ukraine: Austria’s tightrope walk

Neutrality has long been at the core of Austria’s post-World War II identity. While the country pledged millions to support Ukraine and has supported the EU sanctions against Russia, it also wants to keep the communication channels with the Kremlin open, Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner told EURACTIV Germany in an exclusive interview.

According to data[https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/] from the Kiel Institute for World Economy, Austria has pledged more than €580 Million to Ukraine – mostly in humanitarian aid. “Every request that comes from Ukraine, everything that is needed, is checked by us and then also delivered,” Tanner stressed.

However, the neutrality that is enshrined in the Austrian constitution won’t allow for any weapon deliveries.

“It is important to emphasise that while we are militarily neutral according to our constitution and legal regulations, we are certainly not politically neutral when it comes to Ukraine,” Tanner told EURACTIV. “That is why we have supported all EU sanctions from the very beginning. Because the point is to stand in solidarity with Ukraine,” she added.

Despite this political commitment to Ukraine, Austria still seeks to keep channels with Russia open.

While the EU has put all members of the Russian Duma on its sanction list in February 2022, Austria will open its gates for Russian parliamentarians later this month, when the OSCE assembly meeting in Vienna.

The decision has been heavily criticised by EU allies, especially since the parliamentary assembly will meet exactly one year after Russia started its war against Ukraine.

“I think it’s important not only to help but also to keep diplomatic channels open. That is certainly happening,” Tanner stressed, adding that “We have a great history in Austria as mediators.”

“It’s just difficult, as long as the weapons are talking, diplomacy is put in the second row, so to speak. But that doesn’t mean that you don’t have to make an effort every day. And that also happens,” Tanner emphasised.

Migration Austria, due to its proximity to Ukraine, has been a preferred destination for Ukrainian refugees following Russia’s attack on the country, taking in “over 50,000 war refugees,” Tanner stressed.

“We have taken them in and looked after them. I think that is a very important achievement,” she explained, adding that Austria’s government had ensured that the Ukrainian refugees, mostly women and children, received access to childcare and schooling.

Simultaneously, Austria has also been on the receiving end of an asylum seeker influx comparable to that during the refugee crisis of 2015, putting additional stress on the system. In 2022, applications for asylum tripled to more than 100,000, the largest spike registered in the EU[https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/austria-registers-highest-spike-in-asylum-application-in-eu/].

Meanwhile, Hungary, which recently struck a migration pact with Austria and Serbia, registered a mere 46 applications within its borders. “That says it all, I think,” Tanner noted, adding that “this is a cause for concern because it shows that obviously, the Europe-wide system is not working.”

That has become the reason that Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer and Interior Minister Gerhard Karner are “fighting to face this problem together as the European Union,” she said.

In doing so, the Austrian government has been looking for allies ahead of a special EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Wednesday (8 February). “This is an everyday task,” she stressed, adding that Karner had gone to Italy to meet his counterpart and discuss the issue.

Austria "between Scylla and Charybdis" in OSCE conference

Vienna/Kyiv/Moscow - Austria is a tight spot over Russia's participation in an OSCE meeting in Vienna, says an international legal expert. "Austria is moving between Scylla and Charybdis", said Peter Hilpold to the APA.

While Austria had the legal possibility to deny entry to the Russian delegation, but would have to take the international legal responsibility for it. The Austrian foreign ministry had a different view on this.

If the arrival was permitted as announced, however, then the international accusation of bypassing sanctions or even violating sanctions was possible, even though this was not entirely correct from an EU standpoint, said the expert from the University of Innsbruck. EU sanctions were not strictly given in this case. The only concrete accusation which could be lobbed at Austria was that the country had not used a sanction possibility. "Politically speaking, this is delicate enough, no doubt about it", said the expert.

The headquarters agreement between Austria and the OSCE, which Austrian foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg (conservative People's Party, VP) was referring to, offered enough options, according to Hilpold. The agreement made it mandatory for Austria to make the entry "easier" for members of delegations from OSCE member states. Sanctions were not addressed. "'Making it easier' did not necessarily mean an obligation to make an exception for sanctions", said the expert.

Russian delegates should not be excluded from participating in the upcoming OSCE assembly meeting in Vienna, said Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg after parliamentarians from 20 OSCE countries urged his government last week to bar Russian diplomats from attending.

The meeting will be held in Vienna on 23-24 February, exactly one year after Russia invaded Ukraine. All members of the Russian delegation announced so far are on sanction lists of the European Union according to Der Standard.[https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000143074561/oesterreich-droht-eklat-wegen-visa-fuer-russen-auf-eu-sanktionsliste]

As the host to the OSCE headquarters, Austria must allow all delegates from all participating states to enter Austria, said Schallenberg who also regretted the meeting’s planned date as “a very unfortunate one”.

“But at the same time, we must not disregard the fact that we need platforms. The OSCE has never been an organisation of like-minded people,” he told the Austrian Public Broadcast’s show Zeit im Bild in an interview on Sunday evening.

Every relationship and every conversation with Russia would be difficult, “but we have to stay in dialogue”, he said. “Because at some point, hopefully, diplomacy will be given space again.”

Among the countries that called on Austria to prevent Russian officials from entering the country[https://www.diepresse.com/6246145/osze-brandbrief-an-oesterreich-verhindert-teilnahme-der-russischen-delegation], Lithuania even threatened to boycott the meeting if Austria were not to even consider the call.

“Our delegation will probably not be able to go there and sit in the same room with the people who should be standing before a special military tribunal because those people are directly responsible for initiating the war,” the leader of the Lithuanian delegation Vilija Aleknaitė-Abramikienė told reporters at the Lithuanian parliament on Friday, LRT reported[https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1881843/lithuania-threatens-to-boycott-osce-event-if-russian-mps-are-invited].

Speaking about Lithuania’s announced boycott, Schallenberg said during the Zeit im Bild interview that it would be “a pity” for the OSCE parliamentary assembly, which brings together parliamentarians from the OSCE countries, to be so “emotionally overloaded” while the OSCE ambassadors’ meeting would take place every Tuesday in the Hofburg palace in Vienna.

It would also be of value to show how isolated Russia had become and to make clear there is “no return to the status quo ante” with someone like President Vladimir Putin, Schallenberg added.

Still, it would be important that the Austrian nation distinguishes “between Putin, his system and his henchmen and Russia, its history, its culture and also its people”, he added.

The OSCE is currently struggling to get its 2023 budget approved due to a lack of cooperation from Russia. This has left the organisation struggling with its mandate and to make key decisions such as who will hold future rotating chairmanships.

In addition, there is no mechanism within the OSCE to remove Russia or place limitations on them, meaning the requests for banning Russian officials seem unlikely to be heard.

The Austrian court of auditors will not pursue the far-right FPÖ over allegations it received money from a Russian spin doctor in 2016 in exchange for introducing a pro-Russian proposal to parliament, citing procedural reasons.

Hacked emails of a “Russian chief propagandist” would show how representatives of the far-right opposition party FPÖ and other right-wing populists became “willing PR tools of Putin” after the annexation of Crimea, research by the magazine Profil[https://www.profil.at/investigativ/moskau-mails-die-fpoe-im-netz-der-kreml-propaganda/402315584] shows.

FPÖ members also discussed money in exchange for pro-Russian proposals presented in parliament and ordered PR articles and visits to Moscow.

Still, due to procedural reasons, the Court of Auditors has decided not to pursue the matter, Spokesman Christian Neuwirth tweeted on Monday.

He was referring to the latest amendment to the Political Parties Act, which allows the court to intervene in cases of “reasonable suspicion”, while the Independent Party Transparency Senate (UPTS) is only allowed to sanction matters after 1 January 2023.

“Already the dissemination of such a suspicion fulfils the elements of the offence of honour insult and credit damage as well as defamation,” said the FPÖ in a statement to APA, rejecting all allegations.

The Independent Party Transparency Senate (UPTS) is an independent authority established by a constitutional provision to impose fines and monetary penalties for violations of certain provisions of the Political Parties Act (at the Federal Chancellery).

An ‘expired’ contract

In 2016, the FPÖ signed a five-year cooperation agreement with Russia’s ruling party United Russia, intending to strengthen political and economic ties between Vienna and Moscow, but is now refusing to disclose it.

Confronted with the pact available to APA, FPÖ Secretary-General Christian Hafenecker said it had “expired”, claiming that the Russia side would also confirm it

The Social Democrat opposition party (SPÖ) insisted on Tuesday that the FPÖ leader Herbert Kickl should “immediately disclose all contracts between the FPÖ and the Putin’s United Russia party” and to voluntarily grant the court of auditors full access to the party’s finances.

“If the FPÖ continues to refuse control, the serious suspicion will only be confirmed,” SPÖ federal Director Christian Deutsch said in a statement, adding that the far-right party has tabled 30 pro-Russian motions in parliament since the start of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.

The OSCE meeting

Austria is already in the spotlight for the upcoming OSCE assembly meeting in Vienna set to take place from 23-24 February, after parliamentarians from 20 OSCE countries urged the government to bar Russian diplomats[https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/austrian-fm-defends-russian-participation-at-osce-meeting/] from attending.

Austrian FM Alexander Schallenberg recently regretted the meeting’s planned date as “a very unfortunate one” but noted that Vienna must allow all delegates from all participating states to enter the country.

“But at the same time, we must not disregard the fact that we need platforms. The OSCE has never been an organisation of like-minded people,” he added.

The OSCE is currently struggling to get its 2023 budget approved due to a lack of cooperation from Russia. This has left the organisation struggling with its mandate and to make critical decisions such as who will hold future rotating chairmanships.

In addition, there is no mechanism within the OSCE to remove Russia or place limitations on them, meaning the requests for banning Russian officials seem unlikely to be heard.

New sustainable projects have been announced for refineries in Europe that halted crude processing over the last few years.

** Dutch storage company Vopak, which is acquiring the shares of Gunvor Petroleum Antwerp from commodity trader Gunvor Group, said it will redevelop "sustainably" the site together with the Port of Antwerp-Bruges. The two companies will "focus on joint development and implementation to support renewable energy," and jointly develop a "new green energy hub," they said in a statement Feb. 6. The site, which includes a terminal and the former refinery, which was mothballed in 2020, offers "deepsea, river, road and rail access, as well as pipeline connections to Northwest Europe" with adjacent and future pipelines suitable for transporting propylene, ethylene and hydrogen, the statement said. The refinery stopped crude processing at the end of May 2020.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said, adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

** Finnish refiner Neste reiterated in its 2022 financial report that it had launched a strategic study on transitioning its Porvoo refinery to a renewable and circular site and that it expects to end crude oil refining in the mid-2030s. "Neste will also continue to actively study opportunities of green hydrogen at its Porvoo refinery," it said.

Separately, Neste expects utilization at its renewables production facilities to remain high in 2023, "except for the one-month shutdown at Rotterdam" in Q1, "due to an occurrence of a fire in a process unit in late December." It also said that in Q4 2022 it had both "planned and unplanned" shutdowns at the Rotterdam refinery.

** Meanwhile, the UK government along with industry is investing GBP113 million ($136 million) on hydrogen and electric flight technologies in a new round of funding, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said in a statement. The investment would support light-weight batteries for small aircraft in a project led by Vertical Aerospace, and development of a liquid hydrogen combustion jet engine led by Rolls-Royce, BEIS said.

Government and industry are jointly backing the projects through the Aerospace Technology Institute Programme.

The ATI Programme supported the recent successful test flight of ZeroAvia's hydrogen fuel cell-powered flight in a 19-seater aircraft in January.

In addition, airline Virgin Atlantic is to receive government funding for a first ever 100% sustainable aviation fuel-powered transatlantic flight. The flight from London to New York will take off later this year, BEIS said.

CONVENTIONAL UPGRADES

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Poland's PKN Orlen said Jan. 20 it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil products loading terminal in Gdansk. PKN said both investments are scheduled to be commissioned by mid-2025. The hydrocracking base oils project will help the company diversify into second- and third-generation base oils.

** The expansion of Orlen Unipetrol's steam cracker at Litvinov is still ongoing, the company said Dec. 2022. The company said in October 2021 it was contracting Technip Energies to build a new steam cracker furnace to be commissioned in 2022. The construction of an 11th furnace is set to boost production capacity to 585,000 mt/year of ethylene from 545,000 mt/year. The company plans to increase total petrochemical production capacity to 1.4 million mt/year by 2030 from 900,000 mt/year.

PKN Orlen has completed the Czech Koruna 9.6 billion ($410 million) polyethylene 3 unit investment at Litvinov. The refinery's owner, Unipetrol, a 100%-owned PKN subsidiary, has taken charge of the black polyethylene unit, the second part of the investment. The first part, the natural polyethylene unit, was completed in April 2020. The polyethylene 3 unit, which can produce 270,000 mt/year of high density polyethylene, will replace production of one of the two existing production units with a capacity of 120,000 mt/year. Litvinov's polyethylene capacity will increase from 320,000 mt/year to 470,000 mt/year. PKN Orlen was launching construction of a unit at Litvinov to produce up to 26,000 mt/year of dicyclopentadiene, or DCPC, used in the automotive, construction and electronic industries. Separately, McDermott International has been awarded a contract for engineering, procurement and construction management services for an upgrade of the hydrocracker at the Litvinov refinery.

** Motor Oil Hellas has approved an investment into a new propylene splitter unit at the Corinth refinery. It will have 100,000 mt annual capacity and is expected to be completed by 2026. It will use the existing infrastructure of the FCC unit which will switch part of the gasoline production into propylene. The splitter is a "significant step" towards diversifying the refinery operations, the company said.

** Croatia's Rijeka refinery halted operations for five months between November 2022 and April 2023 while it continues with its upgrade project. During the shutdown, works will be carried out on "connecting existing units with new systems", the company said. It also clarified that "several suspensions" of operations are planned for the duration of the upgrade project, in which it is investing more than HRK4 billion ($524 million), as "the refinery cannot operate continuously while work is being carried out" on the existing and new units. The upgrade involves construction of a new residue complex, which includes a delayed coker. Works on the new residue complex started in 2020. Commissioning of the new complex is planned for 2024, the company said.

** France's Donges refinery is building a new hydrodesulfurization unit due to start up in the fourth quarter of 2023.

** OMV Petrom will build a new unit for aromatics products at its Petrobrazi refinery. The company said it will invest approximately EUR130 million ($142 million) on the new unit whose processing capacity will be around 1,500 mt/day of reformed gasoline. The existing aromatics unit, which started production in 1961, will be replaced over 2023-2025, and the new unit will be put in operation in 2026. OMV also said it has "successfully completed the transportation of four coke drums." The new drums will replace the current ones, which have been in use since 1989, and will be operational in 2023. The company is also considering other significant investments at Petrobrazi, "both in the technological efficiency of the refinery as well as in the production of second-generation biofuels," the company said.

** Repsol will build a new plant at Tarragona to produce 27,000 mt/year of cross-linkable polyethylene (XLPE) from mid-2024. It will also invest Eur18 million in an upgrade of its polyols unit, due to conclude in Q4 2023.

** Bosnia's Brod refinery has started construction of a bitumen unit. The refinery, which has been offline since 2019 for an upgrade, had been expected to restart once it was connected to a gas pipeline, allowing it to switch to gas-fired power operations. The line was connected in December 2021, but the plant remains offline. The owner has not given a reason why. A solar power facility at the plant has also been built to help power operations.

** Slovakia's Slovnaft is modernizing and expanding polypropylene production at the Bratislava refinery. The capacity of the PP3 unit will increase by 33,000 mt/year to 300,000 mt/year. Construction was expected to start in the summer of 2023 and be completed in October 2024.

** Poland's PKN Orlen has signed a contract with Linde to build a new oxygen and nitrogen production unit at its Plock refinery. The unit will produce 38,500 cu m/hour of oxygen and 75,000 cu m/hour of nitrogen, supplying gas feedstock for the new Olefin III complex and other installations at Plock. The project is due to be completed by the start of 2025.

** A visbreaking unit at PKN's Plock refinery will have a capacity to produce 200,000 mt/year of diesel. Ongoing modernization of the hydrocracking and diesel hydrodesulfurization units at Plock will also increase the refinery's diesel production capacity. Separately, PKN Orlen has bought a license and base design from US engineering company KBR for a potential bottom-of-the-barrel project. If PKN takes a final investment decision, it will construct a production complex using solvent de-asphalting and fluid catalytic cracking technologies.

** Romania's Rompetrol expects the new cogeneration plant at the Petromidia refinery to be online by July 2023. The Kazakh-Romanian Energy Investment Fund, or FIEKR, has raised Eur83 million syndicated credit facility for financing the project, which represents over 65% of the overall investment, estimated at $148 million. In 2020, the fund signed an engineering, procurement and construction contract for Turkey's Calik Enerji to build the cogeneration plant, and in June 2021, it started the execution of the contract. The new facility will be fueled mainly by natural gas and up to 25% by the fuel gas from refining technological processes. Its efficiency will reach 92%. It will have 80 MW capacity, out of which the largest amount will be used to cover Petromidia's electricity needs, and the rest will be used to heat water for the town of Navodari's heating system. In 2020, two other projects were approved which aimed at modernizing the Petromidia refinery. They comprised building a diesel dewaxing unit which will allow the refinery to improve the production of winter diesel and increase the production of special aviation fuel. In addition, the refinery is working on increasing by more than 30% its polymer production by converting the high density polyethylene installation into a polypropylene installation.

** Azerbaijan's state oil company Socar is looking to expand the capacity of its 212,000 b/d Star refinery in Turkey. Socar said it could expand Star's capacity to 13 million mt/year (261,000 b/d) by means of "flexibilities" in the refinery's design.

** PKN Orlen has signed an EPC contract with UK-based Petrofac to build a bottom-of-the-barrel unit at its Mazeikiu refinery in Lithuania. The unit is expected to be completed by the end of 2024 and will allow a rise in the production of high-margin products to 86% of the total, from 73%.

** Turkish construction group Tekfen Insaat said that together with partner HMB Hallesche Mitteldeutsche Bau it has signed an EPC contract with Turkey's main refiner Tupras to construct a new sulfur recovery unit at the Kirikkale refinery. Tupras' upgrade plans for its four refineries include new sulfur units at its three main refineries, Izmit, Izmir and Kirikkale. Tupras is also carrying out a revamp of the FCC unit at Izmit, which will include the installation of flue gas treatment and energy back recovery systems.

** Portugal's Galp will build a desulfurization unit with a processing capacity of 20,000 b/d at the Sines refinery. The project will allow the company to widen its crude slate.

** Greece's Hellenic Petroleum said in 2021 that Eur35 million had been approved for a capacity increase at the polypropylene production unit at Thessaloniki to 300,000 mt/year, with the implementation targeted within 2-1/2 years.

** Serbia's Pancevo refinery expects to complete its FCC project in 2023. The refinery also plans to build a unit to produce the octane enhancement chemical ETBE by 2024.

** Bulgaria's Burgas refinery has awarded a contract to US Lummus Technology for a 280,000 mt/year polypropylene plant. The deal includes a technology license as well as basic design engineering, training and services, and catalyst supply.

** ExxonMobil said it has "made a final investment decision to expand" the Fawley refinery in the UK to increase production of ultra low sulfur diesel by 45%, or 38,000 b/d. The more than $1 billion investment includes a hydrotreater to remove sulfur from diesel, supported by a hydrogen plant.

** Israel's Haifa District Court has rejected an appeal by Haifa municipality along with six other neighboring communities and environmental groups against the proposed expansion of the Bazan refinery.

BIOFUEL, HYDROGEN UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** Finland's Neste said in its 2022 financial report that the new renewable products' production capacity in Rotterdam will expand renewable fuels production by 1.3 million mt/year "by the first half of 2026", bringing the total product capacity in Rotterdam to 2.7 million mt/year, with sustainable aviation fuel accounting for 1.2 million mt/year. The new production unit is set to be started up in the first half of 2026.

Separately, the expansion at the Singapore facility has "reached mechanical completion at the end of 2022 and is currently on schedule for start-up by the end of the first quarter 2023," Neste said. The expanded Singapore facility will include "optionality to produce" up to 1 million mt/year of SAF, which together with the Rotterdam project would result in a SAF production capability of 1.5 million mt/year in the beginning of 2024.

After commissioning "the next world-scale renewables refinery in Rotterdam," Neste's total SAF production capability is projected to increase to 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026.

Neste also reiterated that it had established a joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, with the joint operation "targeting to reach full Phase I capacity by the end of the first quarter of 2023."

Neste's current production capacity for renewable products is 3.3 million mt/year which is set to increase to 5.5 million mt/year by the end of 2023 due to the expansion at Singapore and the Martinez joint venture. When completed, the Rotterdam expansion project will further increase the total capacity to 6.8 million mt/year by the end of 2026, S&P Global has reported.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

In Oct. 2021, Gunvor said it had agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Phillips 66 is looking at carbon capture and storage as well as electrolytic green hydrogen production to decarbonize operations at its Humber refinery in the UK, Commercial Manager for Emerging Energy Mike Wailes said Feb. 2023. The initial focus is on post-combustion capture from the refining process, including from the crude topping unit, fluid catalytic cracker and hydro-desulfurization unit, with further more expensive options coming from refueling to use hydrogen, he said.

The refinery is part of the East Coast Cluster industrial decarbonization hub, selected for funding support under the UK government's first phase of CCS cluster sequencing.

Phillips 66 is developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to be powered by offshore wind which can be scalable to 300 MW.

The refinery is the only UK SAF producer, Wailes said.

The Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways in early 2022.

Phillips 66 has said previously its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Portugal's Galp said it expects to sanction key projects in 2023, including 270,000 mt/year production of HVO capacity for producing advanced biodiesel and SAF, with a final investment decision expected in the year. In terms of green hydrogen, it also expects to take FID on a 100 MW Sines hydrogen production plant during 2023, targeting an eventual roll out of up to 700 MW to the end of the decade. The 100-MW Sines electrolyzer project will target to replace existing conventional hydrogen production. Previously, Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Spain's Repsol is to build a new 25,000 mt/year production line for recycled polyethylene at its Puertollano site. The new line, which will produce high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) with a recycled plastic content of 10%-80%, was expected to come into operation by the end of 2024. Current capacity for the plastics production at the site is 16,000 mt/year. Puertollano is also due to start a first polyurethane foam recovery plant this year at Puertollano while it also has plans to build a new unit to produce 15,000 mt/year of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) to come online in 2024 with an investment of Eur105 million.

** Spain's Cepsa and a subsidiary of Spanish gas grid operator Enagas have signed an agreement with PV expert Alter Enersun to jointly develop a 200 MW green hydrogen plant at the Huelva refinery. Output from the plant, which aims to be operational in 2026 will be used to supply Cepsa's own industrial consumption and will enable the manufacture of advanced biofuels. The facility will be powered by a solar PV plant with 200 MW capacity.

Cepsa said earlier it would invest Eur3 billion to develop green hydrogen capacity of 2 GW producing up to 300,000 mt/year of green hydrogen at its two refinery sites at Huelva and nearby Campo de Gibraltar (Algeciras) by 2028. Both refineries produce and consume grey hydrogen, with a consumption of 120,000 mt/year of hydrogen, according to an S&P Global estimate. Huelva produces hydrogen through two steam reforming units and a pressure swing adsorption hydrogen recovery plant, according to company data.

Cepsa has already signed an agreement with the Port of Rotterdam to create the first green hydrogen corridor between southern and northern Europe, allowing the export of green ammonia and methanol.

Separately, Cepsa said in December 2022 it concluded a conversion project at one of its idled units at the Huelva refinery to increase first and second-generation biofuels, which reduce CO2 emissions by 90%. The refurbished desulfurization unit will produce a sustainable diesel known as hydrotreated biodiesel, which is made from vegetable oil, vegetable waste, and animal fats not used for human consumption.

The new unit will initially produce 400 mt/d of hydrotreated biodiesel which can be eventually doubled to 800 mt/d. Cepsa started production of advanced 2G biofuels at the Huelva site in October using cooking oils as feedstock. Cepsa plans to hit annual production of 2.5 million mt of advanced biofuels by 2030, including 800,000 mt/year of sustainable aviation fuel.

** Renewable hydrogen company Everfuel has signed an agreement in Jan. 2023 to supply oxygen to an undisclosed company from its HySynergy electrolyzer in Fredericia, Denmark, enabling a higher utilization of the plant. The conditional agreement will improve the overall utilization and efficiency of the second phase of the electrolyzer, providing a long-term revenue stream, Everfuel said. HySynergy 2.0 will extend the existing 20 MW electrolyzer with 300 MW of additional capacity by 2025. It will be developed with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia and will produce hydrogen to decarbonize industrial processes and transportation. The first 20-MW phase started hydrogen production in December, with first commercial deliveries due in 2023. The plant, adjacent to the Fredericia oil refinery, will supply renewable hydrogen to the facility and for local zero-emissions transport, Everfuel said. The plant will send 80% of the hydrogen produced to the refinery for use as a feedstock in the refining process. The remaining 20% will go to hydrogen mobility applications. Phase two is to be built in three 100-MW stages.

** Neste has received a grant of Eur27.7 million ($29 million) for green hydrogen projects at its Porvoo refinery in Finland, the company said in late December 2022. The funding from Business Finland was approved under the EU's Important Projects of Common European Interest scheme, clearing the way for state support. Neste had said it was targeting a final investment decision in late 2023 for its 'Sustainable Hydrogen and Recovery of Carbon' project at Porvoo. The project includes a 50-MW electrolyzer to produce 8,000 mt/year of renewable hydrogen, along with a carbon capture plant that will capture 300,000-400,000 mt/year of CO2 from the company's existing hydrogen production unit, Neste told S&P Global Commodity Insights. Neste plans to switch around a quarter of its Porvoo hydrogen production to low-carbon sources with these developments, out of annual demand of over 100,000 mt.

Separately Neste said it has launched a study to transition its Porvoo refinery "to non-crude oil refining and into a globally leading renewable and circular solutions site." The transformation could see the end of crude refining at Porvoo in the mid-2030s. Through benefiting from "available refining assets, experience and know-how, Neste targets to significantly grow its renewables and circular production in Porvoo long term," Neste said. The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste will also build a chemical recycling facility at its Porvoo refinery. The project aims to pretreat and upgrade liquefied waste plastic and integrate the technologies into the refinery operations. It targets 400,000 mt/year pretreatment capacities "contributing to Neste's goal of processing over 1 million mt of waste plastic per year from 2030 onward." The investment decision was targeted for 2023 and gradual implementation expected to start in 2024. Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

** Spain's Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for its planned 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

Other projects include a 2,100 mt/year synthetic fuel plant and supporting hydrogen infrastructure to come online from 2024.

A separate plant, costing Eur20 million is contemplated to generate gas to feed the refinery from urban waste and should be online by 2025.

** Piling work for a new biofuel plant being built by Shell at the site of Europe's biggest refinery, Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam (formerly Pernis), was due to be completed around summer 2023, with the new plant expected to start up in 2024 or 2025. Shell is building an 820,000 mt/year biofuel plant in Rotterdam to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste. The facility will not use virgin palm oil as a feedstock although it will process vegetable oils, such as rapeseed, to supplement the waste feedstocks "until even more sustainable advanced feedstocks are widely available," it said.

** Repsol along with Spanish companies Naturgy and Reganosa plan to construct a hydrogen electrolyzer at Meirama, close to the A Coruna plant, with the output used to feed the refinery. The first phase of the project will see 30 MW of installed capacity by 2025 at the site of a closed thermal power plant. A subsequent upgrade will take the project to 200 MW capacity, producing 30,000 mt of green hydrogen per year. A newly installed hydrotreatment unit at Spain's A Coruna that processes vegetable and cooking oils was expected to boost biofuel output by 5,500 mt/year in 2022, with the volume rising to 10,500 mt/year by 2024.

** Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery. The contract covers engineering, procurement and construction assistance for the conversion of Grandpuits "into a zero-crude platform oriented towards SAF," it said. Once in operation, the facility will have the capacity to produce 210,000 mt/year of SAF from sustainable feedstock such as used cooking oil and animal fat. Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in Q1 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform, starting in 2024.

Separately, Air Liquide is to invest over Eur130 million ($134 million) in a low-carbon hydrogen unit at the Grandpuits biorefinery. TotalEnergies has committed to buy the hydrogen under a long-term contract to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The new reforming unit, with capacity to produce over 20,000 mt/year of hydrogen, will partly recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, in place of the natural gas it normally uses.

TotalEnergies also said that its zero-crude project at Grandpuits "is based on the development of several future-oriented activities" which include chemical recycling of plastic waste, production of biosourced and biodegradable bioplastics, production of biofuels for the aviation sector, construction of a solar farm and electricity storage by batteries. The new units will be starting up from 2022 and are expected to be operational by 2025.

** Turkey's Tupras said it had completed basic engineering studies to produce sustainable aviation fuel at its Izmir refinery using Honeywell's UOP ecofining technology. Tupras said it plans eventually to produce 400,000 mt/year of SAF, renewable diesel and other products at Izmir.

** Croatia's INA is studying various options for its Sisak refinery, including a biorefinery, biogas plant and production of pure hydrogen.

** Italy's Eni said it was "investigating the opportunity to build a new bio-refinery at Eni's industrial site in Livorno." It will be Eni's third biorefinery in Italy after converting its Gela and Venice refineries into biofuel plants. Eni said its feasibility study involves building "three new plants for the production of hydrogenated biofuel: a biogenic feedstock pre-treatment unit, a 500,000 mt/year Ecofining plant and a plant for the production of hydrogen from methane gas." The design of the three plants will be completed by 2023 and construction by 2025. Local officials welcomed the potential conversion of the Livorno refinery into a biorefinery as it would maintain "the current workforce and the entire production chain."

** Italy's Eni has started producing SAF at its Taranto refinery in southern Italy, as part of its commitment to decarbonize all its products and processes by 2050. Eni plans to increase its bio-refining capacity to 5 million-6 million mt/year by 2050. Eni targets its SAF capacity to reach at least 500,000 mt/year by 2030. Eni said its SAF production will continue to grow with the start-up of over 10,000 mt/year of SAF from its Livorno refinery using bio-components produced in Eni's existing Gela and Venice bio-refineries. In 2024, Eni plans to launch SAF production at the Gela bio-refinery, where a project is underway for a further 150,000 mt/year of SAF production from 100% renewable raw materials by 2025.

** Italy's Eni said that it will install a 20 MW electrolyzer at its Gela biorefinery and a 10 MW electrolyzer at its Taranto refinery.

** Essar, the owner of the UK's Stanlow refinery, said it has received a hydrogen-powered furnace, which is the first in the UK. The furnace has been commissioned by Essar Oil UK "as it transitions to run its operations on hydrogen as part of HyNet, the UK's leading decarbonization cluster," it said. The furnace, which will run on 100% hydrogen fuel from 2026, "forms a central part of Essar's strategy at Stanlow to become the UK's first low-carbon refinery." The furnace will replace three gas-fired furnaces at the plant's crude distillation unit. Essar is also developing 300,000 cu m of biofuel storage capacity at the site, allowing customers to store, blend and distribute biofuels for the road, aviation and marine sectors. It will become the UK's largest biofuels storage facility when completed.

** OMV Petrom will start producing SAF at its Petrobrazi refinery, which will become the first refinery in Romania to produce the fuel. The refinery will produce SAF by coprocessing locally produced rapeseed oil. In the future, it aims to increase the production capacities and produce sustainable fuels based on various waste feedstocks, such as used cooking oil. "Our goal is that, in 2030, to have an annual combined production of SAF and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil) of about 450 thousand tons," Radu Caprau, member of the Executive Board responsible for Refining & Marketing said.

** Repsol and partners Enerkem and Agbar have presented a project to transform 400,000 mt/year of urban waste to 220,000 mt/year methanol at Tarragona, which should start up in 2025 with an investment of Eur250 million. Spain's Tarragona has started on a series of energy transition projects, including the manufacture of biofuel for aviation and an advanced biofuels plant, which is already under construction. The refinery plans to build a 100-MW hydrogen electrolyzer by 2025.

** Hungarian oil and gas group MOL will build a 10-MW electrolyzer for renewable hydrogen production at its Danube refinery in Szazhalombatta, Hungary. The electrolyzers from US company Plug Power will produce 1,600 mt/year of green hydrogen, with operations starting in 2023.

** OMV said that together with AEG Fuels it will supply SAF from its Schwechat refinery on-demand for the "general aviation segment" to be used as an alternative to conventional jet fuel at the Vienna International Airport. SAF is produced at Schwechat by co-processing Austrian used cooking oil and is supplied via a direct pipeline connection to Vienna's international airport. OMV had also supplied the first batch of SAF to Vienna International Airport for fueling Austrian Airlines aircraft. Schwechat has received the two main components for producing SAF -- the reactor and column. From mid-2023 up to 160,000 mt of liquid biomass will be converted into SAF using an innovative co-processing method, it said. "The new reactor will process substances including vegetable oil together with other feedstocks in a procedure known as co-processing. This innovative process involves refining the biogenic feedstock via a hydrogenation process using hydrogen," OMV said. In the future, the process can be used for processing other feedstock such as used cooking oil or advanced bio-fuels. OMV plans to increase its SAF sales to more than 700,000 mt/year by 2030. Separately, OMV will build the country's largest electrolysis plant at the Schwechat refinery through a joint investment with Kommunalkredit Austria AG. The plant is expected to start in H2 2023. The 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis will produce up to 1,500 mt/year of green hydrogen.

** Germany's Bayernoil is looking at producing SAF from sewage sludge. It could convert 100,000 mt of sewage sludge into SAF annually under Project Bayosine. The processing, which involves pyrolisis, can be done in a new unit at the Vohburg site of the plant.

** Sweden's Preem aims to expand the HVO capacity at its Gothenburg plant from 320,000 cu m/year to 1.3 million cu m/year in 2026. "This is planned to take place in a completely new facility designed to produce renewable vehicle fuels and aviation fuels with great flexibility," it said. In its Lysekil plant, production of HVO from the Synsat plant "was the highest to date," the company said. Preem is rebuilding the existing Synsat plant, so it can produce renewable raw materials and replace part of the fossil production. It is expected to reach renewable production capacity of 950,000 cu m/year by 2024.

** Finland's UPM expects its Leuna biorefinery in Germany to be operational by the end of 2023 and ramp up in 2024. Construction of the facility, which will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals, started in 2020. Its total annual capacity will be 220,000 mt bio-monoethylene glycol and lignin-based renewable functional fillers. It will also produce monopropylene glycol and industrial sugars made from sustainably harvested beechwood sourced regionally in Germany.

** Spain's Castellon will install a 60-MW hydrogen unit for a 2024 start-up with options to expand thereafter, BP Espana said. The start date has been pushed back from a previous 2023 target. The refinery also has plans to triple SAF output to 15,000 b/d as part of an overall decarbonization program, according to press reports.

** France's TotalEnergies said it has "successfully started production" of SAF at its Gonfreville refinery in Normandy. The new site complements the biojet production capacities of the company's La Mede refinery and the Oudalle plant. All the biojet will be supplied to French airports and will be produced from waste and residue sourced from the circular economy. La Mede, in the south of France, and Oudalle, near Le Havre, began producing SAF in April 2021. La Mede stopped processing crude oil at the end of 2016 and was converted into a bio plant in 2019.

** Repsol's Cartagena has started construction of its planned second-generation biofuel plant at the nearby to the refinery Escombreras facility, which should result in the production of 250,000 mt/year of biodiesel from waste from mid-2023. The company will invest Eur200 million in the project that would output biodiesel, biojet, bionaphtha and biopropane, allowing an overall CO2 reduction of 900,000 mt/year. As part of its drive to decarbonize the refinery, Repsol also plans to build a 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer at Cartagena, with a target date of 2025.

** PKN Orlen said its subsidiary Orlen Poludnie has signed an agreement to build a "complex of units for production of II generation bioethanol" at its biofuel refinery in Jedlicze, southern Poland. The B2G complex will include a main unit for bioethanol production and will have the capacity to produce 25,000 mt/year of bioethanol from biomass. In the next stage, a biogas plant will be built. The biomass will be mainly cereals straw sourced from Polish farmers. The bioethanol complex will also include a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant, which will generate heat for bioethanol production. The Jedlicze refinery is a small former petroleum refinery, which together with the Trzebinia refinery, was incorporated into Orlen Poludnie, the company's biofuels subsidiary.

** Poland's PKN Orlen is constructing a hydrogen plant at its Poludnie biorefinery in Trzebinia. Annual production will be 16 million cu m, and three-quarters of that will be used to produce glycol. The remainder will be used to produce 45 kg/h of fuel-grade hydrogen for use in transport.

** Orsted and BP are to jointly develop a 50 MW renewable hydrogen project at BP's Lingen refinery in Germany. The project, expected to be operational in 2024, would comprise a 50 MW electrolyzer capable of generating 9,000 mt/year of hydrogen, 20% of the refinery's current fossil-based hydrogen consumption. The electrolyzer is expected to be powered by an Orsted North Sea offshore wind farm. The partners have a longer-term ambition to build more than 500 MW of renewable hydrogen capacity at Lingen, providing renewable hydrogen to meet all the refinery's hydrogen demand and provide feedstock for future synthetic fuel production.

** Italian energy company Eni and SEA, the operator of Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, have signed an agreement to supply SAF for commercial flights, as a step towards accelerating the "ecological transition" of the two airports. Eni plans to develop Eni Biojet which will be made "exclusively" from used cooking oil or animal fats and can be "used in a blend with conventional jet fuel of up to 50%," Umberto Carrara, Director of Green/Traditional Refining and Market at Eni said. The company plans to produce around 200,000 mt/year by 2024 and double the production by 2030.

** BP has partnered with Dutch green hydrogen company HyCC to develop its 250-MW H2-Fifty electrolyzer project in Rotterdam. The companies will next select a technology partner for the previously announced renewable hydrogen project and begin environmental studies, with a final investment decision expected in 2023. The project is expected to come online in 2025. The renewable hydrogen produced at the facility will replace fossil-based feedstock at BP's Rotterdam refinery and other industries in the area. The plant will be situated in the Maasvlakte area of Rotterdam.

** Russia's Lukoil said in December 2021 that it has signed memorandum of intent with Rusatom Overseas, part of the Rosatom Group, to cooperate in the production and supply of green hydrogen for the company's Petrotel refinery in Ploesti, Romania.

** Varo Energy's Cressier refinery in Switzerland will use solar panel generated electricity by 19,000 photovoltaic panels for a "significant portion" of the electricity it consumes. Varo Energy Group and Groupe E will build the "most powerful ground-mounted solar facility in Switzerland" with an installed capacity of 7.7 MW. It will be built in the industrial zone east of the refinery. At full power the park will be able to supply more than 60% of the refinery's needs.

** ExxonMobil, Macquarie's Green Investment Group, and SGN are studying the potential for a low-carbon hydrogen hub centered around ExxonMobil's Fawley refinery on the UK's south coast. Initial hydrogen production could be around 4.3 TWh/year from 2030. Hydrogen demand in the Southampton industrial cluster around the refinery could reach 37 TWh by 2050.

** Italy's Saras is working on activating a green hydrogen plant for a total of 20 MW. Saras is building the green hydrogen plant with Italian utility Enel. The hydrogen produced would be used at the Sarroch refinery. It is currently provided by the IGCC complex and two reforming units on the industrial site.

** The Refhyne II consortium, developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for Shell's Rheinland refinery in Germany at its Wesseling site, has received a Eur32.4 million grant from the EU. The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Polish refiner PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery. The unit will process used rapeseed oil to produce an additive to diesel or aviation fuel. The annual production of the unit will be 300,000 mt of biodiesel or aviation biofuel. The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies will stop using palm oil at La Mede from 2023. The biorefinery has already significantly reduced the amount of palm oil it processes from 500,000 mt/year initially to 100,000 mt/year in 2021. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

Once again, Austria put the integrity and solidarity of the European Union under duress.

Late last year, its government did so by arbitrarily denying access to Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area.

Now, by inviting Russian deputies who are under EU sanctions and barred from entering the bloc, in order to participate in the meeting of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

The meeting in Vienna is set to be held on 23 and 24 February, exactly one year after the start of Russia's war against Ukraine.

And the 15 Russian Duma members who have been granted visas are not on the EU sanction list by random chance.

They are among those bearing the brunt of responsibility for Russia’s brutal, unprovoked, and unjustified full-scale invasion of its neighbour.

Yet today, Austria is ready to welcome them in Vienna, in an extremely embarrassing move for an EU member state.

Interests and values of the Union are at stake

When it comes to individuals who are placed on the sanctions list, Brussels applies both economic and diplomatic restrictive measures, meaning that the member states are expected to freeze their assets and apply a travel ban.

Any derogation from this principle, even if done by just one member state, is a slap in the face of anyone who believes in European values and their protection.

Personally, as a Member of the European Parliament, I feel appalled by Austria’s decision.

It is impossible to stay indifferent and not react when you see an EU member state acting against the interests and values of the Union.

Therefore, today I formally asked the Council of the EU to address this issue, and I sincerely hope it will react as a matter of urgency.

We cannot allow similar incidents to ruin something which was so hard to build and remains so dear to us all: common EU foreign and security policy.

Would you rather sit at the table with Russia or Ukraine?

Austria took the decision to invite the Russian delegation to the OSCE assembly meeting, knowing that it would cause an international outcry.

Several member states have already warned that they could boycott it as a result. And most importantly — Ukraine will.

If the Russian delegation attends OSCE, I think all the rest of the organisation's members will have to boycott as well.

If Austria prefers to sit at the table with Russia and not with Ukraine, I am afraid it will have to face the consequences under the EU legal framework.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shakes hands with OSCE Chairman-In-Office and Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau in Kyiv, 2 August 2022 (AP/Ukrainian Presidential Press Office)[https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/40/50/70/808x532_cmsv2_a51e3225-f178-590b-b56f-f823461a7a34-7405070.jpg]

In my address to the Council, I asked to put into question the voting rights of the representatives of the Austrian government in the EU's strategic and crisis-solving body, as well as its other rights.

This question is inevitable if you consider that Austria, through this move, disregarded EU values listed under Article 2.

Famously, this article has enshrined "values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights"as the Union's most essential tenets.

Providing support to participants in the act of aggression — against the will of the bloc — is at odds with most, if not all, of those.

Possible actions against those found in violation of Article 2 of the Treaty are clearly defined under Article 7 and can lead to the suspension of voting rights, for one.

A meeting in Vienna does not represent extreme circumstances

One could argue that the derogation from the EU sanctions is legitimate and foreseen by the EU legal framework.

To that, I would reply that in this case, we speak about blatant abuse of the derogation procedure, which should be only applied in extreme circumstances, such as for humanitarian aid delivery.

Gathering at a meeting of an organisation — which Russia has continuously disrespected despite its role as the main arbiter on the ground between the occupied territories of Ukraine and Kyiv since 2014 — does not qualify as such.

Flags wave in the wind in front of the entrance of the Permanent Council of the OSCE in Vienna, February 2022 (AP Photo/Lisa Leutner)[https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/40/50/70/808x539_cmsv2_4ad13380-7f10-58d3-9ddb-c41220aab463-7405070.jpg]

On the contrary, it shows a considerable lack of self-respect, bringing Austria's famed neutrality into question as well.

Being neutral, in my view, which I believe is shared by many, does not mean letting someone walk all over you.

That, in turn, makes me wonder about Vienna's motivation for making this decision.

Why open your doors to enemies and close them to friends?

If Austria sent this invitation because it felt pressure from Russia, it would be an alarming sign. If Austria took this decision of its own free will, again, it would also be a very alarming sign.

Under the current framework, a member state which decides to apply a derogation from sanctions should inform the European Commission and all other EU member states of its choice.

Unfortunately, this framework does not foresee any reaction, discussion or assessment of such decisions.

This is the reason why Austria feels impunity in inviting Russia.

It is also the reason why the Council needs to take a position on that and even consider the revision of the Council Regulation on sanctions against Russia to prevent further “unchecked” and dangerous derogations.

Finally, as a Romanian MEP who went to Bucha and Irpin and saw all the atrocities, who set up a volunteer group to help hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians in distress, who works on the EU budget and tries to do the impossible to confiscate the Russian criminal assets: I simply cannot comprehend how Austria could justify opening its doors to enemies and closing them to friends.

Lithuanian reps to boycott OSCE PA session in Vienna – delegation head

VILNIUS, Feb 21, BNS - Lithuanian representatives will boycott the winter session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna after Austria allowed Russian representatives to attend, Vilija Aleknaite-Abramikiene, head of the Lithuanian Seimas delegation, says.

"The final decision is not to attend. We have waited until yesterday, my suitcase is still ready, hoping that the Austrians will change their decision. They will announce it only today but I have learnt in advance through unofficial channels that they will issue visas to all applicants", she told BNS on Tuesday.

"We have made our minds and we are united, both the position and the opposition, and there are no different views here," the head of the Lithuanian delegation said.

The OSCE PA's winter session in Vienna will take place on Thursday and Friday.

In a joint statement issued after their meeting in Vilnius earlier this month, the Nordic, Baltic and Polish parliamentary delegations said that Russia must be held accountable and responsible for its actions in Ukraine, and that an international legal mechanism should be created to assess the aggressor's crimes.

They noted that Russia's participation in the OSCE PA meeting in Vienna will without doubt be used for propaganda purposes at home and abroad and "will send a very disappointing message to the international community".

Lithuanian invited the Nordic, Baltic and Polish counterparts to join a boycott, if Russia was allowed to attend, but the countries failed to agree on the issue.

Aleknaite-Abramikiene then said representatives of other countries decided to "fight the Russians in the same hall".

All members of the Russian delegation have been on the EU sanction lists for violations of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity since the beginning of 2014.

The OSCE PA session will take place on February 23-24, the anniversary of Russia's war against Ukraine.

The Austrian Foreign Ministry earlier told AFP that the country is "obliged under international law to grant entry to the delegates of all OSCE participating states".

EU Sanctions Against Russia And Criminal Law: A Mismatch?

Since the Russian attack on Ukraine in late February 2022, the European Union was quick to respond with sanctions in order to ramp up economic pressure on the Russian government and cripple its ability to finance the war. As the war continues, almost every month a tightening of the sanctions is announced. So far, the EU has enacted eight sanction packages, which include export and import bans of certain products, embargos with regard to Donetsk, Luhansk, Crimea and Sevastopol, asset freezes and prohibitions to make economic funds available to certain listed persons as well as many financial and other transactional restrictions with regard to Russian entities. The Council Regulations are directly binding on all persons under the jurisdiction of EU Member States. For example, regulations imposing freezing measures apply, among others, to EU companies, including financial and credit institutions, doing business in whole or in part in the EU, and to EU nationals.

An ever-changing landscape

Given the rapid and constant changes of the legal framework, navigating the various sanctions has been a challenge for EU companies. At the same time, many Member States have stepped up enforcement of EU sanctions. Austria, for example, has implemented an interagency taskforce that is not only in charge of locating the assets of listed persons but also with the investigation of possible sanctions violations.  Violations of import or export bans as well as embargos are punishable pursuant to Sec 79 of the Foreign Trade Act. Offenders face imprisonment of up to three years, five years if violations are committed on a commercial scale or with the aid of falsified evidence or data. The Sanctions Act, on the other hand, is much broader than the Foreign Trade Act. It applies when no other criminal provision (such as the Foreign Trade Act) provides for stricter sentences and prohibits the violation of directly applicable EU law, i.e. asset freezes and prohibitions to make economic funds available. Offenders can be jailed for up to two years.

Principle of legality

Given the severe consequences of a sanctions violation by EU citizens it does not seem unreasonable to insist that the principle of legality is adhered. This principle implies a need for clarity, predictability and accessibility for criminal prohibitions, limiting current interpretive activities at the EU level, the frequently asked questions "FAQ". Although the FAQ are a helpful tool when working with the EU sanctions, it is often overlooked in practice, that the FAQ are not a legal act, but "a working document drafted by the Commission services in order to help and give guidance to national authorities, EU operators and citizens for the implementation and the interpretation of the EC Council Regulations". Thus, national authorities may not simply rely on the FAQ but have to challenge whether the "interpretation" provided by the Commission is in line with the letter of the law.   

EU sanctions must be enforced in line with the principles of a fair trial, and most importantly in accordance with the principle of legality.

Lithuanian reps at OSCE PA: we've decided not to be in same room with Russian reps

VILNIUS, Feb 22, BNS – Members of the Lithuanian Seimas delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe will not attend the winter session in Vienna because they have decided not to be in the same room with supporters of Russian leader Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine.

"We will not attend the winter session in Vienna this time, and our motive is very simple: we believe that Russia, which has crossed all possible red lines, should not take part in a joint discussion with lawmakers from other countries, all the more so, it's very insulting, both politically and morally, to the Ukrainian delegation," Vilija Aleknaite-Abramikiene, head of the Lithuanian delegation, told a press conference at the Seimas on Wednesday.

Laurynas Kasciunas, a member of the delegation and chair of the parliamentary Committee on National Security and Defense, says Russia's OSCE PA delegation is made up of "Putin's supporters in the Duma, who are contenders for the status of war criminals".

"That's why we have decided not to be in the same room and the same city with them this time", Kasciunas said. "Vienna is now very likely to become a place for the performance and provocations of Duma representatives, and not only by means of speeches, but also by means of press conferences. Apparently, they will try to brag about the fact that they have managed to come, and they can do so, despite the fact that they are all sanctioned. So, we have decided to simply not take part in these games."

Members of the Lithuanian delegation had tried to prevent Russia's representatives from obtaining visas, and had also tried to postpone the Assembly and move it to Vilnius and hold it at the Seimas in March, but to no avail.

"Austria argues that Vienna, like New York and Geneva, is the capital of the organization and that it issues visas to all organizations invited by the Parliamentary Assembly. This is true and we cannot blame the Austrians alone for this situation we are facing," Aleknaite-Abramikiene said.

On Tuesday, Lithuania's representatives said they would boycott the OSCE PA winter session to be held on Thursday and Friday, a year after Russia attacked Ukraine.

In a joint statement issued after their meeting in Vilnius earlier this month, the Nordic, Baltic and Polish parliamentary delegations said that Russia must be held accountable and responsible for its actions in Ukraine, and that an international legal mechanism should be created to assess the aggressor's crimes.

They noted that Russia's participation in the OSCE PA meeting in Vienna will without doubt be used for propaganda purposes at home and abroad and "will send a very disappointing message to the international community".

Ireland
Russian address of security gathering prompts walkout

Russia has faced a walkout of delegates of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) at its winter gathering in Vienna.

Yesterday's walkout came as the Russian delegation head Pyotr Tolstoy, deputy chairman of the state Duma, began addressing the two-day gathering. Some delegates left the room while others remained, waving Ukraine flags.

Ukraine and Lithuania have boycotted the gathering after Austria issued visas for 18 Russian MPs, six of whom are on EU travel sanction lists, to attend the organisation's winter gathering in the Hofburg palace. "Murderers belong in prison. We are boycotting this gathering because murderers are sitting at the table," said Natalya Pipa, a Ukrainian MP and OSCE delegate who demonstrated outside rather than attend.

Opening address

In a critical opening address, OSCE president Margareta Cederfelt said Russia's warmongering had sent Europe "spiralling into the unknown". Quoting from War and Peace, written by the Russian delegate's great-great-grandfather, she noted Leo Tolstoy's observation "war is so unjust and ugly that all who wage it must try to stifle the voice of conscience within themselves".

"Some in this room have trampled on their mandates," she said. "Some have become promoters of war, murder, and destruction."

Reading the speech of the absent Ukrainian delegation, Slovakian representative Peter Osusky said: "We must not let the warmongers win: not now, not ever."

From provisional base in a nearby hotel, Ukraine's delegation head, Mykyta Poturaiev, said he was not interested in hearing Russian "propaganda".

Because of OSCE rules, a veto by Russia has forced the organisation to end its work in Ukraine. That prompted Mr Poturaiev to demanded an overhaul of OSCE procedures, saying: "If one OSCE member attacks another, they should be suspended."

Even ahead of the winter gathering, which ends today, the OSCE's Russia dilemma has ballooned into a political scandal for Austria.

Foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg said Austria had no legal means - either in its agreements with the Vienna-based OSCE or in international law - to withhold visas from the Russian delegation, though he admitted the date of the event was "most unfortunate ... At the same time, we must not disregard the fact that we need platforms," he told Austria's ORF broadcaster. "The OSCE has never been an organisation of like-minded people."

The organisation was created in 1975, at the height of the cold war by the so-called Helsinki process, which pursued east-west detente and dialogue on issues such as arms control, human rights and press freedom.

Ireland's OSCE ambassador, Anne-Marie Callan, condemned Russia's war on Ukraine and its "appalling brutal and tragic consequences for the country ... We can be in no doubt that the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms is crucial for sustainable peace and security," she told the gathering.

Austrian parliamentary president Wolfgang Sobotka condemned the war but said his country, as OSCE host, had a "duty not to slam the door on diplomacy ... One day the war will end and then dialogue is required," he said.

REFINERY NEWS ROUNDUP: Hydrogen, green ammonia projects in Europe

A number of hydrogen and green ammonia projects have been announced in Europe.

** The UK's Birmingham Airport has partnered with zero-emission aviation company ZeroAvia to start hydrogen-powered flights from the middle of the decade, ZeroAvia said in a statement. ZeroAvia is developing a 20-seat aircraft for commercial flights of 300 nautical miles by 2025, opening up the possibility of the first flights from Birmingham to nearby cities such as Glasgow, Aberdeen, Belfast and Dublin, it said.

ZeroAvia is aiming to expand the range and size of aircraft to up to 700 miles in 40-80 seat aircraft by 2027.

The company is also working with Shell and the Netherlands' Rotterdam The Hague Airport on hydrogen-powered flights, for demonstration flights to European destinations by the end of 2024 and commercial operations by 2025.

It carried out a first test flight on its 19-seater demonstration model in the UK in January.

** Stanlow Terminals will develop a new open-access green ammonia import facility at the Port of Liverpool in northwest England by 2027, as part of Essar's plans to become a major energy transition hub in the region, it said in a statement.

The new terminal will be an expansion of existing facilities, and provide infrastructure to import and store over 1 million mt/year of ammonia, it said.

The ammonia could be sent for onward distribution in the UK, or converted back into hydrogen to supply regional consumers. The terminal will also connect to the 1-GW HyNet low-carbon hydrogen project centered around Essar's Stanlow refinery. Stanlow Terminals is currently undertaking feasibility studies for the ammonia project, with operations scheduled to start in 2027.

** Spain's Cepsa and the ACE Terminal in the Port of Rotterdam have signed a memorandum of understanding on green ammonia imports, the companies said in a statement. Under the MOU, Cepsa will supply green ammonia to the planned import terminal in Rotterdam for conversion back to hydrogen to be used in the industrial sector, or direct application as ammonia in the shipping or other industries, they said. The agreement builds on a separate MOU between Cepsa and the Port of Rotterdam signed in October.

Cepsa is developing 2 GW of renewable hydrogen production at two sites in Andalusia, with a Eur3 million ($3.2 million) investment. The developments form part of the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley.

Gasunie, HES International and Vopak are developing the ACE Terminal for open access green ammonia imports to Netherlands and beyond to continental Europe.

Cepsa aims to start exports of hydrogen and its derivatives from 2027, aligned with the planned start-up of the ACE Terminal, the parties said, adding they planned to move to a binding commercial agreement in the future.

** Arcadia eFuels has awarded a front-end engineering and design contract for its planned 80,000 mt/year synthetic fuels plant in Vordingborg, Denmark, to Technip Energies, the companies said in a statement. The plant will use green hydrogen and captured biogenic CO2 to produce around 55,000 mt/year of "eJet fuel" and 25,000 mt/year of naphtha from 2026, with the possibility of producing diesel too. Construction is planned to start in 2023 and startup of commercial operations by the end of 2024, Arcadia said on its website. The hydrogen will be produced from a 250-MW electrolyzer, powered by renewables.

Biofuel projects also remain in focus for European refiners.

** Italy's Eni reiterated in its Q4 report that in October it launched a study to "assess the economic feasibility of building and operating a biorefinery at the Livorno hub" with a 500,000 mt/year design capacity.

Bio throughput in the fourth quarter fell 35% to 129,000 mt, as lower volumes were processed at Gela and Venice refineries due to a maintenance shutdown, Eni said. In January-December bio throughput was down 18% at 543,000 mt "due to a shutdown that occurred at the Gela biorefinery in the first few months of the year, partly offset by higher throughputs at the Venice biorefinery. Utilization was 50% in the fourth quarter, down from 77% in Q4 2021. Over the whole of 2022, utilization was down at 53% compared to 65%.

It reiterated that in October it "completed the phase-out of palm oil as feedstock supply" for its biorefineries, and fully replaced it with "sustainable raw materials."

Also in October, the first cargo of vegetable oil, produced at Eni's Makueni agri-hub in Kenya, was shipped to the Gela biorefinery where it can be used for the manufacturing of biofuels.

** Refiner Neste and airline Wizz Air have signed a supply deal for 36,000 mt/year of sustainable aviation fuel from 2025, amid ever closer and challenging EU sustainability targets, the companies said. The deal will be for three years, for Wizz Air to use in its European network, the companies said in a statement.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a hydrocracking unit in Orlen Lietuva, Lithuania, a hydrotreated vegetable oils installation and visbreaking unit at Plock and a bioethanol unit at the company's small Polish biofuels plant, Orlen Poludnie.

CONVENTIONAL UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a visbreaking unit at Plock. The visbreaking unit refinery will have a capacity to produce 200,000 mt/year of diesel. Ongoing modernization of the hydrocracking and diesel hydrodesulfurization units at Plock will also increase the refinery's diesel production capacity. Separately, PKN Orlen has bought a license and base design from US engineering company KBR for a potential bottom-of-the-barrel project. If PKN takes a final investment decision, it will construct a production complex using solvent de-asphalting and fluid catalytic cracking technologies.

Separately, PKN Orlen has signed a contract with Linde to build a new oxygen and nitrogen production unit at its Plock refinery. The unit will produce 38,500 cu m/hour of oxygen and 75,000 cu m/hour of nitrogen, supplying gas feedstock for the new Olefin III complex and other installations at Plock. The project is due to be completed by the start of 2025.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Poland's PKN Orlen said it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil products loading terminal in Gdansk. PKN said both investments are scheduled to be commissioned by mid-2025. The hydrocracking base oils project will help the company diversify into second- and third-generation base oils.

** The expansion of Orlen Unipetrol's steam cracker at Litvinov is still ongoing, the company said Dec. 2022. The company said in October 2021 it was contracting Technip Energies to build a new steam cracker furnace to be commissioned in 2022. The construction of an 11th furnace is set to boost production capacity to 585,000 mt/year of ethylene from 545,000 mt/year. The company plans to increase total petrochemical production capacity to 1.4 million mt/year by 2030 from 900,000 mt/year.

PKN Orlen has completed the Czech Koruna 9.6 billion ($410 million) polyethylene 3 unit investment at Litvinov. The refinery's owner, Unipetrol, a 100%-owned PKN subsidiary, has taken charge of the black polyethylene unit, the second part of the investment. The first part, the natural polyethylene unit, was completed in April 2020. The polyethylene 3 unit, which can produce 270,000 mt/year of high density polyethylene, will replace production of one of the two existing production units with a capacity of 120,000 mt/year. Litvinov's polyethylene capacity will increase from 320,000 mt/year to 470,000 mt/year. PKN Orlen was launching construction of a unit at Litvinov to produce up to 26,000 mt/year of dicyclopentadiene, or DCPC, used in the automotive, construction and electronic industries. Separately, McDermott International has been awarded a contract for engineering, procurement and construction management services for an upgrade of the hydrocracker at the Litvinov refinery.

** Motor Oil Hellas has approved an investment into a new propylene splitter unit at the Corinth refinery. It will have 100,000 mt annual capacity and is expected to be completed by 2026. It will use the existing infrastructure of the FCC unit which will switch part of the gasoline production into propylene. The splitter is a "significant step" towards diversifying the refinery operations, the company said.

** Croatia's Rijeka refinery halted operations for five months between November 2022 and April 2023 while it continues with its upgrade project. During the shutdown, works will be carried out on "connecting existing units with new systems", the company said. It also clarified that "several suspensions" of operations are planned for the duration of the upgrade project, in which it is investing more than HRK4 billion ($524 million), as "the refinery cannot operate continuously while work is being carried out" on the existing and new units. The upgrade involves construction of a new residue complex, which includes a delayed coker. Works on the new residue complex started in 2020. Commissioning of the new complex is planned for 2024, the company said.

** France's Donges refinery is building a new hydrodesulfurization unit due to start up in the fourth quarter of 2023.

** OMV Petrom will build a new unit for aromatics products at its Petrobrazi refinery. The company said it will invest approximately EUR130 million ($142 million) on the new unit whose processing capacity will be around 1,500 mt/day of reformed gasoline. The existing aromatics unit, which started production in 1961, will be replaced over 2023-2025, and the new unit will be put in operation in 2026. OMV also said it has "successfully completed the transportation of four coke drums." The new drums will replace the current ones, which have been in use since 1989, and will be operational in 2023. The company is also considering other significant investments at Petrobrazi, "both in the technological efficiency of the refinery as well as in the production of second-generation biofuels," the company said.

** Repsol will build a new plant at Tarragona to produce 27,000 mt/year of cross-linkable polyethylene (XLPE) from mid-2024. It will also invest Eur18 million in an upgrade of its polyols unit, due to conclude in Q4 2023.

** Bosnia's Brod refinery has started construction of a bitumen unit. The refinery, which has been offline since 2019 for an upgrade, had been expected to restart once it was connected to a gas pipeline, allowing it to switch to gas-fired power operations. The line was connected in December 2021, but the plant remains offline. The owner has not given a reason why. A solar power facility at the plant has also been built to help power operations.

** Slovakia's Slovnaft is modernizing and expanding polypropylene production at the Bratislava refinery. The capacity of the PP3 unit will increase by 33,000 mt/year to 300,000 mt/year. Construction was expected to start in the summer of 2023 and be completed in October 2024.

** Romania's Rompetrol expects the new cogeneration plant at the Petromidia refinery to be online by July 2023. The Kazakh-Romanian Energy Investment Fund, or FIEKR, has raised Eur83 million syndicated credit facility for financing the project, which represents over 65% of the overall investment, estimated at $148 million. In 2020, the fund signed an engineering, procurement and construction contract for Turkey's Calik Enerji to build the cogeneration plant, and in June 2021, it started the execution of the contract. The new facility will be fueled mainly by natural gas and up to 25% by the fuel gas from refining technological processes. Its efficiency will reach 92%. It will have 80 MW capacity, out of which the largest amount will be used to cover Petromidia's electricity needs, and the rest will be used to heat water for the town of Navodari's heating system. In 2020, two other projects were approved which aimed at modernizing the Petromidia refinery. They comprised building a diesel dewaxing unit which will allow the refinery to improve the production of winter diesel and increase the production of special aviation fuel. In addition, the refinery is working on increasing by more than 30% its polymer production by converting the high density polyethylene installation into a polypropylene installation.

** Azerbaijan's state oil company Socar is looking to expand the capacity of its 212,000 b/d Star refinery in Turkey. Socar said it could expand Star's capacity to 13 million mt/year (261,000 b/d) by means of "flexibilities" in the refinery's design.

** PKN Orlen has signed an EPC contract with UK-based Petrofac to build a bottom-of-the-barrel unit at its Mazeikiu refinery in Lithuania. The unit is expected to be completed by the end of 2024 and will allow a rise in the production of high-margin products to 86% of the total, from 73%.

** Turkish construction group Tekfen Insaat said that together with partner HMB Hallesche Mitteldeutsche Bau it has signed an EPC contract with Turkey's main refiner Tupras to construct a new sulfur recovery unit at the Kirikkale refinery. Tupras' upgrade plans for its four refineries include new sulfur units at its three main refineries, Izmit, Izmir and Kirikkale. Tupras is also carrying out a revamp of the FCC unit at Izmit, which will include the installation of flue gas treatment and energy back recovery systems.

** Portugal's Galp will build a desulfurization unit with a processing capacity of 20,000 b/d at the Sines refinery. The project will allow the company to widen its crude slate.

** Greece's Hellenic Petroleum said in 2021 that Eur35 million had been approved for a capacity increase at the polypropylene production unit at Thessaloniki to 300,000 mt/year, with the implementation targeted within 2-1/2 years.

** Serbia's Pancevo refinery expects to complete its FCC project in 2023. The refinery also plans to build a unit to produce the octane enhancement chemical ETBE by 2024.

** Bulgaria's Burgas refinery has awarded a contract to US Lummus Technology for a 280,000 mt/year polypropylene plant. The deal includes a technology license as well as basic design engineering, training and services, and catalyst supply.

** ExxonMobil said it has "made a final investment decision to expand" the Fawley refinery in the UK to increase production of ultra low sulfur diesel by 45%, or 38,000 b/d. The more than $1 billion investment includes a hydrotreater to remove sulfur from diesel, supported by a hydrogen plant.

** Israel's Haifa District Court has rejected an appeal by Haifa municipality along with six other neighboring communities and environmental groups against the proposed expansion of the Bazan refinery.

BIOFUEL, HYDROGEN UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** Repsol CEO Josu Jon Imaz said Repsol would take a final investment decision in H2 2023 on 350 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity spread across Cartagena, Tarragona and Bilbao, all of which are entering their engineering phase.

** BP is set to announce investment in hydrogen and biofuels production at its Spanish Castellon refinery, financial daily El Economista reported February 2023, citing head of BP in Spain Andres Guevara. Speaking at an event, Guevara said the company would approve investment in a 200 MW hydrogen electrolyzer. BP previously announced the refinery would install a 60 MW hydrogen unit for a 2024 start-up, with options to expand its size to 115 MW thereafter. According to the El Economista report, this could be bumped up to 2 GW of capacity as BP is setting its sights on 5GW overall in Spain.

** Refinery operator Cepsa said it and ammonia producer Fertiberia will raise hydrogen capacity at Huelva to 400 MW by 2026, doubling the 200 MW announced in January 2023. The deal is part of Cepsa's plan to reach a target of 1 GW of capacity by 2030 under its Andalusia Hydrogen Valley project, which encompasses renewable generation and export volume to European consumers.

Once the plant reaches its full 1 GW capacity, hydrogen production should reach 150,000 mt/year. Cepsa agreed in January to jointly develop its first 200 MW green hydrogen plant at Huelva with gas grid operator Enagas and PV expert Alter Enersun. Overall, the company plans to invest Eur3 billion ($3.2 billion) to develop green hydrogen capacity of 2 GW producing up to 300,000 mt/year of green hydrogen at its two refinery sites at Huelva and nearby Campo de Gibraltar (Algeciras) by 2028. Huelva produces hydrogen through two steam reforming units and a pressure swing adsorption hydrogen recovery plant, according to company data.

Cepsa has already signed an agreement with the Port of Rotterdam to create the first green hydrogen corridor between southern and northern Europe, allowing the export of green ammonia and methanol.

Separately, Cepsa said in December 2022 it concluded a conversion project at one of its idled units at the Huelva refinery to increase first and second-generation biofuels, which reduce CO2 emissions by 90%. The refurbished desulfurization unit will produce a sustainable diesel known as hydrotreated biodiesel, which is made from vegetable oil, vegetable waste, and animal fats not used for human consumption.

The new unit will initially produce 400 mt/d of hydrotreated biodiesel which can be eventually doubled to 800 mt/d. Cepsa started production of advanced 2G biofuels at the Huelva site in October using cooking oils as feedstock. Cepsa plans to hit annual production of 2.5 million mt of advanced biofuels by 2030, including 800,000 mt/year of sustainable aviation fuel.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a hydrotreated vegetable oils installation at Plock. PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery. The unit will process used rapeseed oil to produce an additive to diesel or aviation fuel. The annual production of the unit will be 300,000 mt of biodiesel or aviation biofuel. The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a bioethanol unit at the company's small Polish biofuels plant, Orlen Poludnie. PKN Orlen is also constructing a hydrogen plant at its Poludnie biorefinery in Trzebinia. Annual production will be 16 million cu m, and three-quarters of that will be used to produce glycol. The remainder will be used to produce 45 kg/h of fuel-grade hydrogen for use in transport.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Finland's Neste said in its 2022 financial report that the new renewable products' production capacity in Rotterdam will expand renewable fuels production by 1.3 million mt/year "by the first half of 2026", bringing the total product capacity in Rotterdam to 2.7 million mt/year, with sustainable aviation fuel accounting for 1.2 million mt/year. The new production unit is set to be started up in the first half of 2026.

Separately, the expansion at the Singapore facility has "reached mechanical completion at the end of 2022 and is currently on schedule for start-up by the end of the first quarter 2023," Neste said. The expanded Singapore facility will include "optionality to produce" up to 1 million mt/year of SAF, which together with the Rotterdam project would result in a SAF production capability of 1.5 million mt/year in the beginning of 2024.

After commissioning "the next world-scale renewables refinery in Rotterdam," Neste's total SAF production capability is projected to increase to 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026.

Neste also reiterated that it had established a joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, with the joint operation "targeting to reach full Phase I capacity by the end of the first quarter of 2023."

Neste's current production capacity for renewable products is 3.3 million mt/year which is set to increase to 5.5 million mt/year by the end of 2023 due to the expansion at Singapore and the Martinez joint venture. When completed, the Rotterdam expansion project will further increase the total capacity to 6.8 million mt/year by the end of 2026, S&P Global has reported.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

In Oct. 2021, Gunvor said it had agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Phillips 66 is looking at carbon capture and storage as well as electrolytic green hydrogen production to decarbonize operations at its Humber refinery in the UK, Commercial Manager for Emerging Energy Mike Wailes said Feb. 2023. The initial focus is on post-combustion capture from the refining process, including from the crude topping unit, fluid catalytic cracker and hydro-desulfurization unit, with further more expensive options coming from refueling to use hydrogen, he said.

The refinery is part of the East Coast Cluster industrial decarbonization hub, selected for funding support under the UK government's first phase of CCS cluster sequencing.

Phillips 66 is developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to be powered by offshore wind which can be scalable to 300 MW.

The refinery is the only UK SAF producer, Wailes said.

The Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways in early 2022.

Phillips 66 has said previously its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Portugal's Galp said it expects to sanction key projects in 2023, including 270,000 mt/year production of HVO capacity for producing advanced biodiesel and SAF, with a final investment decision expected in the year. In terms of green hydrogen, it also expects to take FID on a 100 MW Sines hydrogen production plant during 2023, targeting an eventual roll out of up to 700 MW to the end of the decade. The 100-MW Sines electrolyzer project will target to replace existing conventional hydrogen production. Previously, Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub.

** Spain's Repsol is to build a new 25,000 mt/year production line for recycled polyethylene at its Puertollano site. The new line, which will produce high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) with a recycled plastic content of 10%-80%, was expected to come into operation by the end of 2024. Current capacity for the plastics production at the site is 16,000 mt/year. Puertollano is also due to start a first polyurethane foam recovery plant this year at Puertollano while it also has plans to build a new unit to produce 15,000 mt/year of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) to come online in 2024 with an investment of Eur105 million.

** Renewable hydrogen company Everfuel has signed an agreement in Jan. 2023 to supply oxygen to an undisclosed company from its HySynergy electrolyzer in Fredericia, Denmark, enabling a higher utilization of the plant. The conditional agreement will improve the overall utilization and efficiency of the second phase of the electrolyzer, providing a long-term revenue stream, Everfuel said. HySynergy 2.0 will extend the existing 20 MW electrolyzer with 300 MW of additional capacity by 2025. It will be developed with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia and will produce hydrogen to decarbonize industrial processes and transportation. The first 20-MW phase started hydrogen production in December, with first commercial deliveries due in 2023. The plant, adjacent to the Fredericia oil refinery, will supply renewable hydrogen to the facility and for local zero-emissions transport, Everfuel said. The plant will send 80% of the hydrogen produced to the refinery for use as a feedstock in the refining process. The remaining 20% will go to hydrogen mobility applications. Phase two is to be built in three 100-MW stages.

** Neste has received a grant of Eur27.7 million ($29 million) for green hydrogen projects at its Porvoo refinery in Finland, the company said in late December 2022. The funding from Business Finland was approved under the EU's Important Projects of Common European Interest scheme, clearing the way for state support. Neste had said it was targeting a final investment decision in late 2023 for its 'Sustainable Hydrogen and Recovery of Carbon' project at Porvoo. The project includes a 50-MW electrolyzer to produce 8,000 mt/year of renewable hydrogen, along with a carbon capture plant that will capture 300,000-400,000 mt/year of CO2 from the company's existing hydrogen production unit, Neste told S&P Global Commodity Insights. Neste plans to switch around a quarter of its Porvoo hydrogen production to low-carbon sources with these developments, out of annual demand of over 100,000 mt.

Separately Neste said it has launched a study to transition its Porvoo refinery "to non-crude oil refining and into a globally leading renewable and circular solutions site." The transformation could see the end of crude refining at Porvoo in the mid-2030s. Through benefiting from "available refining assets, experience and know-how, Neste targets to significantly grow its renewables and circular production in Porvoo long term," Neste said. The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste will also build a chemical recycling facility at its Porvoo refinery. The project aims to pretreat and upgrade liquefied waste plastic and integrate the technologies into the refinery operations. It targets 400,000 mt/year pretreatment capacities "contributing to Neste's goal of processing over 1 million mt of waste plastic per year from 2030 onward." The investment decision was targeted for 2023 and gradual implementation expected to start in 2024. Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

** Spain's Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for its planned 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

Other projects include a 2,100 mt/year synthetic fuel plant and supporting hydrogen infrastructure to come online from 2024.

A separate plant, costing Eur20 million is contemplated to generate gas to feed the refinery from urban waste and should be online by 2025.

** Piling work for a new biofuel plant being built by Shell at the site of Europe's biggest refinery, Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam (formerly Pernis), was due to be completed around summer 2023, with the new plant expected to start up in 2024 or 2025. Shell is building an 820,000 mt/year biofuel plant in Rotterdam to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste. The facility will not use virgin palm oil as a feedstock although it will process vegetable oils, such as rapeseed, to supplement the waste feedstocks "until even more sustainable advanced feedstocks are widely available," it said.

** Repsol along with Spanish companies Naturgy and Reganosa plan to construct a hydrogen electrolyzer at Meirama, close to the A Coruna plant, with the output used to feed the refinery. The first phase of the project will see 30 MW of installed capacity by 2025 at the site of a closed thermal power plant. A subsequent upgrade will take the project to 200 MW capacity, producing 30,000 mt of green hydrogen per year. A newly installed hydrotreatment unit at Spain's A Coruna that processes vegetable and cooking oils was expected to boost biofuel output by 5,500 mt/year in 2022, with the volume rising to 10,500 mt/year by 2024.

** Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery. The contract covers engineering, procurement and construction assistance for the conversion of Grandpuits "into a zero-crude platform oriented towards SAF," it said. Once in operation, the facility will have the capacity to produce 210,000 mt/year of SAF from sustainable feedstock such as used cooking oil and animal fat. Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in Q1 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform, starting in 2024.

Separately, Air Liquide is to invest over Eur130 million ($134 million) in a low-carbon hydrogen unit at the Grandpuits biorefinery. TotalEnergies has committed to buy the hydrogen under a long-term contract to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The new reforming unit, with capacity to produce over 20,000 mt/year of hydrogen, will partly recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, in place of the natural gas it normally uses.

TotalEnergies also said that its zero-crude project at Grandpuits "is based on the development of several future-oriented activities" which include chemical recycling of plastic waste, production of biosourced and biodegradable bioplastics, production of biofuels for the aviation sector, construction of a solar farm and electricity storage by batteries. The new units will be starting up from 2022 and are expected to be operational by 2025.

** Turkey's Tupras said it had completed basic engineering studies to produce sustainable aviation fuel at its Izmir refinery using Honeywell's UOP ecofining technology. Tupras said it plans eventually to produce 400,000 mt/year of SAF, renewable diesel and other products at Izmir.

** Croatia's INA is studying various options for its Sisak refinery, including a biorefinery, biogas plant and production of pure hydrogen.

** Italy's Eni said it was "investigating the opportunity to build a new bio-refinery at Eni's industrial site in Livorno." It will be Eni's third biorefinery in Italy after converting its Gela and Venice refineries into biofuel plants. Eni said its feasibility study involves building "three new plants for the production of hydrogenated biofuel: a biogenic feedstock pre-treatment unit, a 500,000 mt/year Ecofining plant and a plant for the production of hydrogen from methane gas." The design of the three plants will be completed by 2023 and construction by 2025. Local officials welcomed the potential conversion of the Livorno refinery into a biorefinery as it would maintain "the current workforce and the entire production chain."

** Italy's Eni has started producing SAF at its Taranto refinery in southern Italy, as part of its commitment to decarbonize all its products and processes by 2050. Eni plans to increase its bio-refining capacity to 5 million-6 million mt/year by 2050. Eni targets its SAF capacity to reach at least 500,000 mt/year by 2030. Eni said its SAF production will continue to grow with the start-up of over 10,000 mt/year of SAF from its Livorno refinery using bio-components produced in Eni's existing Gela and Venice bio-refineries. In 2024, Eni plans to launch SAF production at the Gela bio-refinery, where a project is underway for a further 150,000 mt/year of SAF production from 100% renewable raw materials by 2025.

** Italy's Eni said that it will install a 20 MW electrolyzer at its Gela biorefinery and a 10 MW electrolyzer at its Taranto refinery. The electrolyzers will be part of a project to develop green hydrogen by Enel Green Power and Eni which will receive public funding approved by the European Commission.

** Ineos has awarded a design contract for a planned 190,000 mt/year low-carbon hydrogen production plant at its Grangemouth refining and petrochemical site in Scotland to engineering company Atkins. The plant is expected to be operational by 2030.

** Essar, the owner of the UK's Stanlow refinery, said it has received a hydrogen-powered furnace, which is the first in the UK. The furnace has been commissioned by Essar Oil UK "as it transitions to run its operations on hydrogen as part of HyNet, the UK's leading decarbonization cluster," it said. The furnace, which will run on 100% hydrogen fuel from 2026, "forms a central part of Essar's strategy at Stanlow to become the UK's first low-carbon refinery." The furnace will replace three gas-fired furnaces at the plant's crude distillation unit. Essar is also developing 300,000 cu m of biofuel storage capacity at the site, allowing customers to store, blend and distribute biofuels for the road, aviation and marine sectors. It will become the UK's largest biofuels storage facility when completed.

** OMV Petrom will start producing SAF at its Petrobrazi refinery, which will become the first refinery in Romania to produce the fuel. The refinery will produce SAF by coprocessing locally produced rapeseed oil. In the future, it aims to increase the production capacities and produce sustainable fuels based on various waste feedstocks, such as used cooking oil. "Our goal is that, in 2030, to have an annual combined production of SAF and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil) of about 450 thousand tons," Radu Caprau, member of the Executive Board responsible for Refining & Marketing said.

** Repsol and partners Enerkem and Agbar have presented a project to transform 400,000 mt/year of urban waste to 220,000 mt/year methanol at Tarragona, which should start up in 2025 with an investment of Eur250 million. Spain's Tarragona has started on a series of energy transition projects, including the manufacture of biofuel for aviation and an advanced biofuels plant, which is already under construction. The refinery plans to build a 100-MW hydrogen electrolyzer by 2025.

** Hungarian oil and gas group MOL will build a 10-MW electrolyzer for renewable hydrogen production at its Danube refinery in Szazhalombatta, Hungary. The electrolyzers from US company Plug Power will produce 1,600 mt/year of green hydrogen, with operations starting in 2023.

** OMV said that together with AEG Fuels it will supply SAF from its Schwechat refinery on-demand for the "general aviation segment" to be used as an alternative to conventional jet fuel at the Vienna International Airport. SAF is produced at Schwechat by co-processing Austrian used cooking oil and is supplied via a direct pipeline connection to Vienna's international airport. OMV had also supplied the first batch of SAF to Vienna International Airport for fueling Austrian Airlines aircraft. Schwechat has received the two main components for producing SAF -- the reactor and column. From mid-2023 up to 160,000 mt of liquid biomass will be converted into SAF using an innovative co-processing method, it said. "The new reactor will process substances including vegetable oil together with other feedstocks in a procedure known as co-processing. This innovative process involves refining the biogenic feedstock via a hydrogenation process using hydrogen," OMV said. In the future, the process can be used for processing other feedstock such as used cooking oil or advanced bio-fuels. OMV plans to increase its SAF sales to more than 700,000 mt/year by 2030. Separately, OMV will build the country's largest electrolysis plant at the Schwechat refinery through a joint investment with Kommunalkredit Austria AG. The plant is expected to start in H2 2023. The 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis will produce up to 1,500 mt/year of green hydrogen.

** Germany's Bayernoil is looking at producing SAF from sewage sludge. It could convert 100,000 mt of sewage sludge into SAF annually under Project Bayosine. The processing, which involves pyrolisis, can be done in a new unit at the Vohburg site of the plant.

** Sweden's Preem aims to expand the HVO capacity at its Gothenburg plant from 320,000 cu m/year to 1.3 million cu m/year in 2026. "This is planned to take place in a completely new facility designed to produce renewable vehicle fuels and aviation fuels with great flexibility," it said. In its Lysekil plant, production of HVO from the Synsat plant "was the highest to date," the company said. Preem is rebuilding the existing Synsat plant, so it can produce renewable raw materials and replace part of the fossil production. It is expected to reach renewable production capacity of 950,000 cu m/year by 2024.

** Finland's UPM expects its Leuna biorefinery in Germany to be operational by the end of 2023 and ramp up in 2024. Construction of the facility, which will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals, started in 2020. Its total annual capacity will be 220,000 mt bio-monoethylene glycol and lignin-based renewable functional fillers. It will also produce monopropylene glycol and industrial sugars made from sustainably harvested beechwood sourced regionally in Germany.

** Greece's Motor Oil Hellas said its Corinth refinery by 2030 aims to enhance its pure hydrogen infrastructure through demonstration and scale-up of green hydrogen. In the long term, it aims to be a "large producer of clean hydrogen".

** Spain's Castellon will install a 60-MW hydrogen unit for a 2024 start-up with options to expand thereafter, BP Espana said. The start date has been pushed back from a previous 2023 target. The refinery also has plans to triple SAF output to 15,000 b/d as part of an overall decarbonization program, according to press reports.

** France's TotalEnergies said it has "successfully started production" of SAF at its Gonfreville refinery in Normandy. The new site complements the biojet production capacities of the company's La Mede refinery and the Oudalle plant. All the biojet will be supplied to French airports and will be produced from waste and residue sourced from the circular economy. La Mede, in the south of France, and Oudalle, near Le Havre, began producing SAF in April 2021. La Mede stopped processing crude oil at the end of 2016 and was converted into a bio plant in 2019.

** Repsol's Cartagena has started construction of its planned second-generation biofuel plant at the nearby to the refinery Escombreras facility, which should result in the production of 250,000 mt/year of biodiesel from waste from mid-2023. The company will invest Eur200 million in the project that would output biodiesel, biojet, bionaphtha and biopropane, allowing an overall CO2 reduction of 900,000 mt/year. As part of its drive to decarbonize the refinery, Repsol also plans to build a 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer at Cartagena, with a target date of 2025.

** PKN Orlen said its subsidiary Orlen Poludnie has signed an agreement to build a "complex of units for production of II generation bioethanol" at its biofuel refinery in Jedlicze, southern Poland. The B2G complex will include a main unit for bioethanol production and will have the capacity to produce 25,000 mt/year of bioethanol from biomass. In the next stage, a biogas plant will be built. The biomass will be mainly cereals straw sourced from Polish farmers. The bioethanol complex will also include a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant, which will generate heat for bioethanol production. The Jedlicze refinery is a small former petroleum refinery, which together with the Trzebinia refinery, was incorporated into Orlen Poludnie, the company's biofuels subsidiary.

** Orsted and BP are to jointly develop a 50 MW renewable hydrogen project at BP's Lingen refinery in Germany. The project, expected to be operational in 2024, would comprise a 50 MW electrolyzer capable of generating 9,000 mt/year of hydrogen, 20% of the refinery's current fossil-based hydrogen consumption. The electrolyzer is expected to be powered by an Orsted North Sea offshore wind farm. The partners have a longer-term ambition to build more than 500 MW of renewable hydrogen capacity at Lingen, providing renewable hydrogen to meet all the refinery's hydrogen demand and provide feedstock for future synthetic fuel production.

** Italian energy company Eni and SEA, the operator of Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, have signed an agreement to supply SAF for commercial flights, as a step towards accelerating the "ecological transition" of the two airports. Eni plans to develop Eni Biojet which will be made "exclusively" from used cooking oil or animal fats and can be "used in a blend with conventional jet fuel of up to 50%," Umberto Carrara, Director of Green/Traditional Refining and Market at Eni said. The company plans to produce around 200,000 mt/year by 2024 and double the production by 2030.

** BP has partnered with Dutch green hydrogen company HyCC to develop its 250-MW H2-Fifty electrolyzer project in Rotterdam. The companies will next select a technology partner for the previously announced renewable hydrogen project and begin environmental studies, with a final investment decision expected in 2023. The project is expected to come online in 2025. The renewable hydrogen produced at the facility will replace fossil-based feedstock at BP's Rotterdam refinery and other industries in the area. The plant will be situated in the Maasvlakte area of Rotterdam.

** Russia's Lukoil said in December 2021 that it has signed memorandum of intent with Rusatom Overseas, part of the Rosatom Group, to cooperate in the production and supply of green hydrogen for the company's Petrotel refinery in Ploesti, Romania.

** Varo Energy's Cressier refinery in Switzerland will use solar panel generated electricity by 19,000 photovoltaic panels for a "significant portion" of the electricity it consumes. Varo Energy Group and Groupe E will build the "most powerful ground-mounted solar facility in Switzerland" with an installed capacity of 7.7 MW. It will be built in the industrial zone east of the refinery. At full power the park will be able to supply more than 60% of the refinery's needs.

** ExxonMobil, Macquarie's Green Investment Group, and SGN are studying the potential for a low-carbon hydrogen hub centered around ExxonMobil's Fawley refinery on the UK's south coast. Initial hydrogen production could be around 4.3 TWh/year from 2030. Hydrogen demand in the Southampton industrial cluster around the refinery could reach 37 TWh by 2050.

** Italy's Saras is working on activating a green hydrogen plant for a total of 20 MW. Saras is building the green hydrogen plant with Italian utility Enel. The hydrogen produced would be used at the Sarroch refinery. It is currently provided by the IGCC complex and two reforming units on the industrial site.

** The Refhyne II consortium, developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for Shell's Rheinland refinery in Germany at its Wesseling site, has received a Eur32.4 million grant from the EU. The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies will stop using palm oil at La Mede from 2023. The biorefinery has already significantly reduced the amount of palm oil it processes from 500,000 mt/year initially to 100,000 mt/year in 2021. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen at Gdansk. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

Companies in Europe are reporting progress on upgrades, including conventional and biofuel refineries.

Meanwhile, Spanish refiner Cepsa is to build 375 MW of solar PV capacity in the sun-rich Extremadura region with an investment of Eur262 million ($281 million), it said March 14. Construction for two PV projects in Merida and La Nava de Santiago will start in 2025, it said. Once in operation they will produce 785 GWh/year of electricity, avoiding emissions of 315,000 mt of CO2, it said.

The projects form part of a 7 GW renewable portfolio target by 2030.

Cepsa, like other integrated oil companies, is expanding into renewables to decarbonize its activities.

Separately, Repsol said March 3 it has brought a new outer port area into service that will allow the unloading of larger tankers to supply the A Coruna refinery in northwest Spain. The new jetty can receive ships of 200,000 dwt.

The facility has now received its first cargo at the new 520 meter dock, it said. The Eur126 million project includes a multi-product pipeline, already completed, with 11 underground tubes -- two for transport of crude oil, eight for petroleum products, and one for water drainage. A second phase of the project will see a direct rail link and the eventual transfer of all port activity to the new area by 2027.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

In Oct. 2021, Gunvor said it had agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Phillips 66 is looking at carbon capture and storage as well as electrolytic green hydrogen production to decarbonize operations at its Humber refinery in the UK, Commercial Manager for Emerging Energy Mike Wailes said Feb. 2023. The initial focus is on post-combustion capture from the refining process, including from the crude topping unit, fluid catalytic cracker and hydro-desulfurization unit, with further more expensive options coming from refueling to use hydrogen, he said.

The refinery is part of the East Coast Cluster industrial decarbonization hub, selected for funding support under the UK government's first phase of CCS cluster sequencing.

Phillips 66 is developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to be powered by offshore wind which can be scalable to 300 MW.

The refinery is the only UK SAF producer, Wailes said.

The Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways in early 2022.

Phillips 66 has said previously its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Portugal's Galp said it expects to sanction key projects in 2023, including 270,000 mt/year production of HVO capacity for producing advanced biodiesel and SAF, with a final investment decision expected in the year. In terms of green hydrogen, it also expects to take FID on a 100 MW Sines hydrogen production plant during 2023, targeting an eventual roll out of up to 700 MW to the end of the decade. The 100-MW Sines electrolyzer project will target to replace existing conventional hydrogen production. Previously, Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub.

** Spain's Repsol is to build a new 25,000 mt/year production line for recycled polyethylene at its Puertollano site.

Current capacity for the plastics production at the site is 16,000 mt/year. Puertollano is also due to start a first polyurethane foam recovery plant this year at Puertollano while it also has plans to build a new unit to produce 15,000 mt/year of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) to come online in 2024 with an investment of Eur105 million.

** Renewable hydrogen company Everfuel has signed an agreement in Jan. 2023 to supply oxygen to an undisclosed company from its HySynergy electrolyzer in Fredericia, Denmark, enabling a higher utilization of the plant. The conditional agreement will improve the overall utilization and efficiency of the second phase of the electrolyzer, providing a long-term revenue stream, Everfuel said. HySynergy 2.0 will extend the existing 20 MW electrolyzer with 300 MW of additional capacity by 2025. It will be developed with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia and will produce hydrogen to decarbonize industrial processes and transportation. The first 20-MW phase started hydrogen production in December, with first commercial deliveries due in 2023. The plant, adjacent to the Fredericia oil refinery, will supply renewable hydrogen to the facility and for local zero-emissions transport, Everfuel said. The plant will send 80% of the hydrogen produced to the refinery for use as a feedstock in the refining process. The remaining 20% will go to hydrogen mobility applications. Phase two is to be built in three 100-MW stages.

** Neste has received a grant of Eur27.7 million ($29 million) for green hydrogen projects at its Porvoo refinery in Finland, the company said in late December 2022. The funding from Business Finland was approved under the EU's Important Projects of Common European Interest scheme, clearing the way for state support. Neste had said it was targeting a final investment decision in late 2023 for its 'Sustainable Hydrogen and Recovery of Carbon' project at Porvoo. The project includes a 50-MW electrolyzer to produce 8,000 mt/year of renewable hydrogen, along with a carbon capture plant that will capture 300,000-400,000 mt/year of CO2 from the company's existing hydrogen production unit, Neste told S&P Global Commodity Insights. Neste plans to switch around a quarter of its Porvoo hydrogen production to low-carbon sources with these developments, out of annual demand of over 100,000 mt.

Separately Neste said it has launched a study to transition its Porvoo refinery "to non-crude oil refining and into a globally leading renewable and circular solutions site." The transformation could see the end of crude refining at Porvoo in the mid-2030s. Through benefiting from "available refining assets, experience and know-how, Neste targets to significantly grow its renewables and circular production in Porvoo long term," Neste said. The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste will also build a chemical recycling facility at its Porvoo refinery. The project aims to pretreat and upgrade liquefied waste plastic and integrate the technologies into the refinery operations. It targets 400,000 mt/year pretreatment capacities "contributing to Neste's goal of processing over 1 million mt of waste plastic per year from 2030 onward." The investment decision was targeted for 2023 and gradual implementation expected to start in 2024. Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

** Spain's Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for its planned 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

Other projects include a 2,100 mt/year synthetic fuel plant and supporting hydrogen infrastructure to come online from 2024.

A separate plant, costing Eur20 million is contemplated to generate gas to feed the refinery from urban waste and should be online by 2025.

** Piling work for a new biofuel plant being built by Shell at the site of Europe's biggest refinery, Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam (formerly Pernis), was due to be completed around summer 2023, with the new plant expected to start up in 2024 or 2025. Shell is building an 820,000 mt/year biofuel plant in Rotterdam to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste. The facility will not use virgin palm oil as a feedstock although it will process vegetable oils, such as rapeseed, to supplement the waste feedstocks "until even more sustainable advanced feedstocks are widely available," it said.

** Repsol along with Spanish companies Naturgy and Reganosa plan to construct a hydrogen electrolyzer at Meirama, close to the A Coruna plant, with the output used to feed the refinery. The first phase of the project will see 30 MW of installed capacity by 2025 at the site of a closed thermal power plant. A subsequent upgrade will take the project to 200 MW capacity, producing 30,000 mt of green hydrogen per year. A newly installed hydrotreatment unit at Spain's A Coruna that processes vegetable and cooking oils was expected to boost biofuel output by 5,500 mt/year in 2022, with the volume rising to 10,500 mt/year by 2024.

** Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery. The contract covers engineering, procurement and construction assistance for the conversion of Grandpuits "into a zero-crude platform oriented towards SAF," it said. Once in operation, the facility will have the capacity to produce 210,000 mt/year of SAF from sustainable feedstock such as used cooking oil and animal fat. Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in Q1 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform, starting in 2024.

Separately, Air Liquide is to invest over Eur130 million ($134 million) in a low-carbon hydrogen unit at the Grandpuits biorefinery. TotalEnergies has committed to buy the hydrogen under a long-term contract to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The new reforming unit, with capacity to produce over 20,000 mt/year of hydrogen, will partly recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, in place of the natural gas it normally uses.

TotalEnergies also said that its zero-crude project at Grandpuits "is based on the development of several future-oriented activities" which include chemical recycling of plastic waste, production of biosourced and biodegradable bioplastics, production of biofuels for the aviation sector, construction of a solar farm and electricity storage by batteries. The new units will be starting up from 2022 and are expected to be operational by 2025.

** OMV said that together with AEG Fuels it will supply SAF from its Schwechat refinery on-demand for the "general aviation segment" to be used as an alternative to conventional jet fuel at the Vienna International Airport. SAF is produced at Schwechat by co-processing Austrian used cooking oil and is supplied via a direct pipeline connection to Vienna's international airport. OMV had also supplied the first batch of SAF to Vienna International Airport for fueling Austrian Airlines aircraft. Schwechat has received the two main components for producing SAF -- the reactor and column. From mid-2023 up to 160,000 mt of liquid biomass will be converted into SAF using an innovative co-processing method, it said. "The new reactor will process substances including vegetable oil together with other feedstocks in a procedure known as co-processing. This innovative process involves refining the biogenic feedstock via a hydrogenation process using hydrogen," OMV said. In the future, the process can be used for processing other feedstock such as used cooking oil or advanced bio-fuels. OMV plans to increase its SAF sales to more than 700,000 mt/year by 2030. Separately, OMV will build the country's largest electrolysis plant at the Schwechat refinery through a joint investment with Kommunalkredit Austria AG. The plant is expected to start in H2 2023. The 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis will produce up to 1,500 mt/year of green hydrogen.

** Germany's Bayernoil is looking at producing SAF from sewage sludge. It could convert 100,000 mt of sewage sludge into SAF annually under Project Bayosine. The processing, which involves pyrolisis, can be done in a new unit at the Vohburg site of the plant.

** Sweden's Preem aims to expand the HVO capacity at its Gothenburg plant from 320,000 cu m/year to 1.3 million cu m/year in 2026. "This is planned to take place in a completely new facility designed to produce renewable vehicle fuels and aviation fuels with great flexibility," it said. In its Lysekil plant, production of HVO from the Synsat plant "was the highest to date," the company said. Preem is rebuilding the existing Synsat plant, so it can produce renewable raw materials and replace part of the fossil production. It is expected to reach renewable production capacity of 950,000 cu m/year by 2024.

** Finland's UPM expects its Leuna biorefinery in Germany to be operational by the end of 2023 and ramp up in 2024.

** France's TotalEnergies said it has "successfully started production" of SAF at its Gonfreville refinery in Normandy. The new site complements the biojet production capacities of the company's La Mede refinery and the Oudalle plant. All the biojet will be supplied to French airports and will be produced from waste and residue sourced from the circular economy. La Mede, in the south of France, and Oudalle, near Le Havre, began producing SAF in April 2021. La Mede stopped processing crude oil at the end of 2016 and was converted into a bio plant in 2019.

** Repsol's Cartagena has started construction of its planned second-generation biofuel plant at the nearby to the refinery Escombreras facility, which should result in the production of 250,000 mt/year of biodiesel from waste from mid-2023. The company will invest Eur200 million in the project that would output biodiesel, biojet, bionaphtha and biopropane, allowing an overall CO2 reduction of 900,000 mt/year. As part of its drive to decarbonize the refinery, Repsol also plans to build a 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer at Cartagena, with a target date of 2025.

** PKN Orlen said its subsidiary Orlen Poludnie has signed an agreement to build a "complex of units for production of II generation bioethanol" at its biofuel refinery in Jedlicze, southern Poland. The B2G complex will include a main unit for bioethanol production and will have the capacity to produce 25,000 mt/year of bioethanol from biomass. In the next stage, a biogas plant will be built. The biomass will be mainly cereals straw sourced from Polish farmers. The bioethanol complex will also include a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant, which will generate heat for bioethanol production. The Jedlicze refinery is a small former petroleum refinery, which together with the Trzebinia refinery, was incorporated into Orlen Poludnie, the company's biofuels subsidiary.

** Orsted and BP are to jointly develop a 50 MW renewable hydrogen project at BP's Lingen refinery in Germany. The project, expected to be operational in 2024, would comprise a 50 MW electrolyzer capable of generating 9,000 mt/year of hydrogen, 20% of the refinery's current fossil-based hydrogen consumption. The electrolyzer is expected to be powered by an Orsted North Sea offshore wind farm. The partners have a longer-term ambition to build more than 500 MW of renewable hydrogen capacity at Lingen, providing renewable hydrogen to meet all the refinery's hydrogen demand and provide feedstock for future synthetic fuel production.

** Italian energy company Eni and SEA, the operator of Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, have signed an agreement to supply SAF for commercial flights, as a step towards accelerating the "ecological transition" of the two airports. Eni plans to develop Eni Biojet which will be made "exclusively" from used cooking oil or animal fats and can be "used in a blend with conventional jet fuel of up to 50%," Umberto Carrara, Director of Green/Traditional Refining and Market at Eni said. The company plans to produce around 200,000 mt/year by 2024 and double the production by 2030.

** BP has partnered with Dutch green hydrogen company HyCC to develop its 250-MW H2-Fifty electrolyzer project in Rotterdam. The companies will next select a technology partner for the previously announced renewable hydrogen project and begin environmental studies, with a final investment decision expected in 2023. The project is expected to come online in 2025. The renewable hydrogen produced at the facility will replace fossil-based feedstock at BP's Rotterdam refinery and other industries in the area. The plant will be situated in the Maasvlakte area of Rotterdam.

** Russia's Lukoil said in December 2021 that it has signed memorandum of intent with Rusatom Overseas, part of the Rosatom Group, to cooperate in the production and supply of green hydrogen for the company's Petrotel refinery in Ploesti, Romania.

** Varo Energy's Cressier refinery in Switzerland will use solar panel generated electricity by 19,000 photovoltaic panels for a "significant portion" of the electricity it consumes. Varo Energy Group and Groupe E will build the "most powerful ground-mounted solar facility in Switzerland" with an installed capacity of 7.7 MW. It will be built in the industrial zone east of the refinery. At full power the park will be able to supply more than 60% of the refinery's needs.

** ExxonMobil, Macquarie's Green Investment Group, and SGN are studying the potential for a low-carbon hydrogen hub centered around ExxonMobil's Fawley refinery on the UK's south coast. Initial hydrogen production could be around 4.3 TWh/year from 2030. Hydrogen demand in the Southampton industrial cluster around the refinery could reach 37 TWh by 2050.

** Italy's Saras is working on activating a green hydrogen plant for a total of 20 MW. Saras is building the green hydrogen plant with Italian utility Enel. The hydrogen produced would be used at the Sarroch refinery. It is currently provided by the IGCC complex and two reforming units on the industrial site.

** The Refhyne II consortium, developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for Shell's Rheinland refinery in Germany at its Wesseling site, has received a Eur32.4 million grant from the EU. The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies will stop using palm oil at La Mede from 2023. The biorefinery has already significantly reduced the amount of palm oil it processes from 500,000 mt/year initially to 100,000 mt/year in 2021. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen at Gdansk. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Turkey's Ersan Petrol is still hopeful of its plans for a 1.4 million mt/year refinery at Kahramanmaras in southeast Turkey will be able to go ahead despite repeated delays and a difficult investment climate. Project coordinator Cenk Pala said Ersan was in talks with prospective partners and sources of finance for the project and hopes to start work on the FEED study this year. The refinery is planned for a 300,000 sq m site in Kahramanmaras which holds a defunct mini refinery that will be dismantled. A pre-feasibility study by Axens has defined the configuration and capacity of the plant which will produce mainly Euro 5 diesel, Euro 5 gasoline, jet and bitumen.

** A new greenfield Porto Romano refinery in Albania will be predominantly oriented to export markets but will also be able to cover Albania's domestic demand, Helmut Mayrhofer, consultant at Larkalis said. Austria-based consultancy Larkalis is leading an international consortium working on the project which will involve building the refinery in the port town of Durres. The refinery has a two-year construction authorization and could be commissioned by end-2025, depending on international developments.

** Azeri state oil company Socar is considering developing a second refinery in Turkey, in addition to its existing 214,000 b/d Star refinery at Aliaga on Turkey's central Aegean coast.

ECB said to be gently exerting pressure on Raiffeisen to quit Russia

The European Central Bank (ECB) is pressing Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) to quit its Russian business, Reuters reported citing unnamed sources.

As covered by bne IntelliNews, RBI is coming under increased secondary sanction pressure from the US for maintaining a lucrative Russian presence as one of the banking sector’s systemic banks, one year into the full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.

Reuters sources also claimed that a top US sanction official had travelled to Vienna to raise concerns about Austria’s second-biggest bank’s business in Russia.

Reportedly, the ECB is pursuing a softer approach. The regulator is not demanding that RBI quit immediately, but wants to see a plan of action for unwinding its business, which could include the sale or closure of its Russian bank. Such a careful approach is said to be linked to fears of further banking turmoil in case RBI gets hit hard financially.

"We have been asking banks to keep closely monitoring the business in Russia, and ideally, reduce it and wind it down as much as possible," a spokesperson for the ECB said, as cited by Reuters, adding it had been doing the same with all institutions concerned since Moscow launched its full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.

A Raiffeisen spokesperson told Reuters that it was examining options for its Russia business, "including a carefully managed exit", and that it was "expediting" its assessment, adding that it had also reduced lending in the country.

As for the pressure from the US, RBI said that it was in the "early stages" of collecting information to respond to the inquiry letter from the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

Most recent reports suggested that RBI is planning to swap €400mn worth of profits trapped in Russia for the blocked European funds of Russian state-controlled bank Sberbank. The swap deal is likely to raise eyebrows and further deepen suspicions that RBI is actively co-operating with Russian authorities and regulators, while intending to repatriate funds for the sanctioned Sberbank.

Raiffeisen, Italy's UniCredit and Citi of the US are among dozens of banks from “unfriendly” countries that remain unable to exit the Russian market due to the special decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin prohibiting any such deals without the special approval by authorities.

The only bank that managed to quickly pull out of Russia following the full-scale military invasion of Ukraine was France's Societe Generale, which sold its fully-owned Rosbank to oligarch Vladimir Potanin.

Citi is winding down its business and reportedly is exploring various options of pulling out of Russia but does not want to “simply give the asset away”. UniCredit bank has so far managed to offload its loan book to local UralSib bank.

European companies reported progress with conventional and hydrogen upgrades.

Slovakia's Slovnaft has awarded an engineering, procurement services and construction management (EPSCM) contract for an off-gas upgrade at its Bratislava steam cracker to McDermott. The Slovnaft refinery, in addition to oil processing and fuel production, produces basic plastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene. The ethylene unit is key to the company's petrochemical segment.

Separately, Sunfire has installed the world's first multi-megawatt high-temperature electrolyzer for production of green hydrogen at Neste's biofuels refinery in Rotterdam, the German electrolysis company said. The 2.6-MW MultiPLHY project, now commissioning, comprises 12 solid oxide electrolysis cell modules at the refinery operating at 850 degrees Celsius. Once operational it will produce over 60 kg/hour of renewable hydrogen. "Utilizing industrial excess heat, the electrolyzer processes steam to hydrogen with the highest conversion efficiency. Compared to other electrolysis solutions, Sunfire's SOEC technology is the most efficient on the market because the high-temperature process significantly reduces the amount of electricity required," the company said.

BP plans to invest up to Eur2 billion in a green hydrogen plant at Spanish Castellon to replace the existing fossil-based hydrogen plant, it said in February 2023. Under the project, BP said it plans a phased development of up to 2 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030.

Separately, Axens said it has acquired stakes in the BioTJet project, which aims to build the largest SAF production unit "using the Fischer-Tropsch process." It will be built in France and started up by 2027, with a final investment decision expected at the end of 2024. The project will "make it possible to process a broad spectrum of lignocellulosic biomasses, which do not compete with food uses," it said.

CONVENTIONAL UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** Slovakia's Slovnaft has awarded an engineering, procurement services and construction management (EPSCM) contract for an off-gas upgrade at its Bratislava steam cracker to McDermott. The project will upgrade the existing steam cracker unit by adding a low-pressure recovery unit, increasing ethylene production capacity utilizing the off-gas from the existing production, McDermott said in a statement.

Following the expansion, the capacity of the PP3 unit will increase by 33,000 mt/year to 300,000 mt/year. Construction was expected to start in the summer of 2023 and be completed in October 2024.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Romania's Rompetrol said the cogeneration plant at the Petromidia refinery has reached "over 80%" general progress, including "around 95% progress on the engineering side, more than 96% on the procurement side and the actual construction is approaching 72%." The Kazakh-Romanian Energy Investment Fund (KREIF) "has made considerable progress in commissioning the cogeneration plant," the company said in March 2023. The project, which started in May 2021, will ensure the refinery's energy needs "exclusively from the cogeneration plant," it said. The new facility will generate approximately 80 MW of electricity. The KREIF is owned by KMG International, a subsidiary of Kazakhstan's state-owned KazMunaiGaz, and the Romanian state.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a visbreaking unit at Plock. The visbreaking unit refinery will have a capacity to produce 200,000 mt/year of diesel. Ongoing modernization of the hydrocracking and diesel hydrodesulfurization units at Plock will also increase the refinery's diesel production capacity.

PKN Orlen has bought a license and base design from US engineering company KBR for a potential bottom-of-the-barrel project. If PKN takes a final investment decision, it will construct a production complex using solvent de-asphalting and fluid catalytic cracking technologies.

Separately, PKN Orlen has signed a contract with Linde to build a new oxygen and nitrogen production unit at its Plock refinery. The unit will produce 38,500 cu m/hour of oxygen and 75,000 cu m/hour of nitrogen, supplying gas feedstock for the new Olefin III complex and other installations at Plock. The project is due to be completed by the start of 2025.

** Poland's PKN Orlen said it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil products loading terminal in Gdansk. PKN said both investments are scheduled to be commissioned by mid-2025. The hydrocracking base oils project will help the company diversify into second- and third-generation base oils.

** The expansion of Orlen Unipetrol's steam cracker at Litvinov is still ongoing, the company said Dec. 2022. The company said in October 2021 it was contracting Technip Energies to build a new steam cracker furnace to be commissioned in 2022. The construction of an 11th furnace is set to boost production capacity to 585,000 mt/year of ethylene from 545,000 mt/year. The company plans to increase total petrochemical production capacity to 1.4 million mt/year by 2030 from 900,000 mt/year.

PKN Orlen has completed the Czech Koruna 9.6 billion ($410 million) polyethylene 3 unit investment at Litvinov. The refinery's owner, Unipetrol, a 100%-owned PKN subsidiary, has taken charge of the black polyethylene unit, the second part of the investment. The first part, the natural polyethylene unit, was completed in April 2020. The polyethylene 3 unit, which can produce 270,000 mt/year of high density polyethylene, will replace production of one of the two existing production units with a capacity of 120,000 mt/year. Litvinov's polyethylene capacity will increase from 320,000 mt/year to 470,000 mt/year. PKN Orlen was launching construction of a unit at Litvinov to produce up to 26,000 mt/year of dicyclopentadiene, or DCPC, used in the automotive, construction and electronic industries. Separately, McDermott International has been awarded a contract for engineering, procurement and construction management services for an upgrade of the hydrocracker at the Litvinov refinery.

** Motor Oil Hellas has approved an investment into a new propylene splitter unit at the Corinth refinery. It will have 100,000 mt annual capacity and is expected to be completed by 2026. It will use the existing infrastructure of the FCC unit which will switch part of the gasoline production into propylene. The splitter is a "significant step" towards diversifying the refinery operations, the company said.

BIOFUEL, HYDROGEN UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** BP plans to invest up to Eur2 billion in a green hydrogen plant at Spanish Castellon to replace the existing fossil-based hydrogen plant, it said in February 2023. Under the project, BP said it plans a phased development of up to 2 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030. The project will also see Castellon's production of biofuels triple to 650,000 mt/year by 2030 with the green hydrogen used as a feedstock in biofuel production, specifically of SAF. The first phase of the project will see the installation of an electrolysis plant with at least 200 MW capacity operational by 2027, with production of up to 31,200 mt/year of green hydrogen. In a second phase, to be completed in 2030, the electrolysis plant would be expanded to reach a capacity of up to 2 GW. BP has created a joint venture with Iberdrola covering Spain, Portugal and the UK to produce green ammonia and methanol as well as 600,000 mt/year of hydrogen. The refinery also has a target to triple sustainable jet fuel output to 15,000 b/d as part of its overall decarbonization program.

** Finland's Neste has successfully concluded its second series of "industrial-scale processing runs with liquefied waste plastic" at the Porvoo refinery after carrying out the first processing run in 2020. The current processing uses the existing refinery equipment but ultimately Neste aims to establish large-scale capacities to process 400,000 mt/yr of liquefied waste plastic. From 2030 it wants to process more than 1 million mt/yr of waste plastic.

The aim is part of Neste's strategic study to transform Porvoo into "a renewable and circular solutions site and possibly end crude oil refining by the mid-2030s," it also said, adding that liquefied waste plastic would play an important part in replacing fossil crude oil.

The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

Neste had said it was targeting a final investment decision in late 2023 for its 'Sustainable Hydrogen and Recovery of Carbon' project at Porvoo. The project includes a 50-MW electrolyzer to produce 8,000 mt/year of renewable hydrogen, along with a carbon capture plant that will capture 300,000-400,000 mt/year of CO2 from the company's existing hydrogen production unit. Neste plans to switch around a quarter of its Porvoo hydrogen production to low-carbon sources with these developments, out of annual demand of over 100,000 mt.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Cepsa said March 8 it will build a new unit to produce second generation biofuel at the Huelva refinery with an investment of Eur1 billion ($1.1 billion).

The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies will stop using palm oil at La Mede from 2023. The biorefinery has already significantly reduced the amount of palm oil it processes from 500,000 mt/year initially to 100,000 mt/year in 2021. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen at Gdansk. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

LAUNCHES

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Turkey's Ersan Petrol is still hopeful of its plans for a 1.4 million mt/year refinery at Kahramanmaras in southeast Turkey will be able to go ahead despite repeated delays and a difficult investment climate. Project coordinator Cenk Pala said Ersan was in talks with prospective partners and sources of finance for the project and hopes to start work on the FEED study this year. The refinery is planned for a 300,000 sq m site in Kahramanmaras which holds a defunct mini refinery that will be dismantled. A pre-feasibility study by Axens has defined the configuration and capacity of the plant which will produce mainly Euro 5 diesel, Euro 5 gasoline, jet and bitumen.

** A new greenfield Porto Romano refinery in Albania will be predominantly oriented to export markets but will also be able to cover Albania's domestic demand, Helmut Mayrhofer, consultant at Larkalis said. Austria-based consultancy Larkalis is leading an international consortium working on the project which will involve building the refinery in the port town of Durres. The refinery has a two-year construction authorization and could be commissioned by end-2025, depending on international developments.

** Azeri state oil company Socar is considering developing a second refinery in Turkey, in addition to its existing 214,000 b/d Star refinery at Aliaga on Turkey's central Aegean coast.

Austria's neutrality sometimes goes so far as to seek equality between aggressor and defender

Before February 24, 2022, Austria - a neutral country, but at the same time a member of the EU that sanctioned Russia - was quite pro-Russian. The red carpet was rolled out for Putin in Vienna, and the Austrian leadership was happy to visit Russia and sign multi-billion contracts. The Austrian media called Russia's ongoing hybrid war in eastern Ukraine a "conflict" or "crisis," with no link to Russia, or sometimes, in general, it was called a "civil war" in the Kremlin's style.

How did the situation change after February 24? How strong is Russia's influence in the country and who are the main drivers of Russian narratives? Is the federal government fighting Russian disinformation, including the one that concerns Ukraine, and how successfully? What is the perception of Russia's war against Ukraine through the prism of Austrian neutrality?

Ukrinform spoke about these and other issues with Dietmar Pichler, an Austrian disinformation expert and a co-founder of the Vienna-based Center for Digital Media Literacy (Zentrum für Digitale Medienkompetenz).

OLD RUSSIAN NARRATIVES HAVE RETURNED TO AUSTRIA SINCE LAST SUMMER, EXCEPT FOR ONE

- After February 24, 2022, the world, for the most part, was clear in defining what was happening and condemning Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, unlike the same events in 2014. What do you think was decisive in this?

- People somehow understood that the annexation of Crimea was an aggressive act against international law by the Russian Federation. However, the same cannot be said about the Russian aggression in Donbas. Despite warlords like Girkin and Borodai, soldiers "on vacation," Russian money and weapons, and several radical groups sent from Russia to Donbas, many people still misunderstood it as an "internal conflict of Ukraine." This includes several politicians who wanted to continue doing business with Russia. Russian disinformation provided the groundwork for such a wrong perception.

In comparison, it was impossible to ignore the full-scale invasion in 2022: almost nobody in the West bought the wording "special operation" by the Kremlin, and it was “officially” communicated that Russian troops are fighting on Ukrainian soil.

- Can we say that the Russian propaganda machine lost this information battle, at least in the stage before the full-scale invasion and its first stage?

- I would differentiate between the days before the full-scale invasion and the days after the invasion in 2022. Especially in Austria during the days before the invasion, we could read a lot of quite pro-Russian narratives. Instead of correctly reporting that "Russia claims to feel threatened by NATO," the media reported "Russia feels threatened by NATO." We heard that "NATO expansion was a provocation for Russia" without mentioning the security interests of, for instance, the Baltic States and Poland.

Some even made fun of the warnings of a large-scale invasion. However, after February 24th, the tune changed. For some time, solidarity with Ukraine and outrage over the Russian attack dominated the discourse, but that state did not last long. Since last summer, we have heard the same old Russian narratives, except for the claim that Russian troops are not active in Ukraine.

MANY PEOPLE ALREADY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A WAR OF DICTATORSHIP AGAINST DEMOCRACY

- How successful has Ukraine been in conveying its narratives about Russia's aggressive war against the Ukrainian people, and how do you generally assess Ukraine's strategic communications and soft power in the struggle for the perception of a warring Ukraine in the world?

- Soft power is very important in gaining support, not only from politicians but also from the general public in democratic countries. When President Zelensky decided not to leave Kyiv, asking for "weapons instead of a ride," it made a huge impact on the Western audience. People are now more familiar with where Ukraine is located, who Ukrainians are, and what is happening in Ukraine. Unfortunately, that does not include the events from 2014. Even more, supporters of Ukraine's resistance against the full-scale invasion by the Russian Federation are not very well informed about the events of 2014/2015.

The clear response by the European Union and the steady support of the United States shows that the call for help and international lobbying for support by Ukrainian officials was indeed successful. Many, but unfortunately not all people, understand that there are not "two former Soviet republics" fighting, but a dictatorship against a democracy. It may sound less relevant now, but cultural diplomacy still plays a huge role. As we see now, the biggest supporters of Ukraine are people who have traveled to the country. During Yanukovich's times, we did not see efforts of cultural diplomacy, and after that, the war in Donbas prevented tourism and overshadowed cultural initiatives. The EU candidate country status is a very important achievement of Ukrainian diplomacy and helpful in understanding the values Ukrainians are fighting for.

GROUP WITH "SOFT" RUSSIAN NARRATIVES MORE DANGEROUS THAN OPENLY PRO-RUSSIAN GROUP

- The self-sacrifice and courage with which Ukrainians are resisting the Russian invasion have caused a wave of interest in Ukraine worldwide. In your opinion, what are the main narratives about Ukraine in the West, particularly in Austria - which, among other things, were imposed by Russian propaganda - that were destroyed during this war?

Firstly, I want to highlight that Austria is one of the countries highly influenced by Russian narratives and has a history of "neutrality" that sometimes goes so far as to seek equality between aggressor and defender, which is morally more than questionable.

We have people who assess the situation as it is. Ukrainians are defending their independence, their right to exist as a free nation, and their path to choose their own destiny towards Europe against the Russian dictatorship.

Then we have people who condemn the war but continue with a list of "justifications," even if they say "nothing can justify the full-scale invasion," but this is exactly what they do. They ask for negotiations without naming what should be negotiated. I think this group, with "soft" Russian narratives, is more dangerous than the last group that is openly pro-Russian, praising the Kremlin and what contemporary Russia stands for.

I would like to add that the biggest problem with the group that asks for "immediate negotiations and stopping the fighting at all costs" is that they are not aware of the situation in the occupied territories and the war crimes happening there. Not only Russian TV propagandists, but also Kremlin officials openly communicate their ideas of cultural genocide, but these goals and activities are not well known among the Austrian public. The idea that "if the fighting stops, the suffering stops" is widespread. Some people who spread this view are possibly paid by the Kremlin, while others are just not well-informed about the actual situation in Ukraine and Russian goals there.

KREMLIN PROPAGANDA IN THE EU IS UNSUCCESSFUL, BUT PUBLIC OPINION IS DIVIDED

- At the same time, Russia is trying to undermine the unity of the West in supporting Ukraine through various influence operations and disinformation campaigns to reduce this support and weaken the sanctions regime. In your estimation, how successful have the Kremlin's actions been in the EU countries so far?

- I would say that if we take a look at the support and unity regarding Ukraine, it seems that the campaigns were not very successful, even though the scale of support could be bigger and better organized.

On the other hand, we have public opinion that is very divided, especially when it comes to "negotiations at all costs" and the delivery of weapons to Ukraine. Surveys show that in countries like Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy, there is a huge impact of Russian narratives on public opinion.

Russian disinformation was successful in convincing many people that "NATO expansion was a trigger for Russia", that "Ukraine needs to be neutral for the sake of Russia's security interests", and that "Ukraine was to blame for the events of 2014".

RUSSIAN NARRATIVES ARE SPREAD MOST BY THE FAR RIGHT AND FAR LEFT

- How vulnerable is Austria to Russia's disinformation campaigns, and what does Russia exploit most in Austrian society to spread its narratives successfully?

- Austrian society is very vulnerable to Russian disinformation campaigns because, unfortunately, we have not taken efforts to tackle that threat since 2014. We have professors who teach at our universities and give interviews to Russia Today, Sputnik, and Iranian state media, spreading Russian or even Soviet narratives for decades. Despite the clear situation, we tend to analyze things "neutrally," even if we depart from reality. Although RT and Sputnik are banned in the EU now, press releases by the Russian Federation find their way to our media, sometimes not reported in the context of the Russian disinformation machine. People are not well informed about Ukraine at all, making them even more vulnerable to Russian disinformation. In political talk shows, several guests are able to spread Russian narratives with almost no resistance. This "false balance" situation is very common and fueled by our "ideology of neutrality." Like in all countries, Russian narratives are most spread and believed by the far right and far left in terms of ideology.

The "we want peace with Russia" position is also common at people who blame sanctions for Europe's economic situation, rather than attributing it to the Russian war of aggression.

- How did the events of February 24 affect Austrian perceptions of Russia and, thus, the narratives spread by the Kremlin?

- Even though the effect was smaller than in other countries, there have been slight improvements in the discourse. More people are now critically questioning pro-Russian positions and our close economic ties with the Russian Federation. However, considering the situation in Ukraine, the developments within Russia, and the goals of the Kremlin, the change in discourse and view of Russia is still far from being based on reality.

MAIN DISTRIBUTORS OF RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA IN AUSTRIA ARE FREEDOM PARTY AND SOME POLITICIANS FROM SOCIAL DEMOCRATS

- Who are the main distributors of Russian propaganda in Austria today?

- The far-right "Freedom Party" is widely known for spreading Russian narratives, particularly after signing a contract with "United Russia" in 2016. However, some politicians from the Social Democrats and especially the Communist parties also disseminate Russian narratives on TV and social media. Speaking of social media, it is one of the main channels where not only trolls but also so-called "intellectuals" or "peace activists" spread their pro-Russian disinformation narratives. The most famous ones are frequently invited to mainstream TV to speak in political talk shows.

At the end of November 2022, I traveled to Ukraine to hold a workshop about the impact of Russian disinformation in the country, with Ukrainian journalists. The group was surprised by how strong the impact of Russian disinformation is in the German-speaking world. One woman summarized it by saying, "I cannot believe what people in Germany and Austria are believing."

- President Zelensky recently gave a speech at the Austrian parliament. What were the reactions in Austrian society?

- President Zelensky's recent video speech in the Austrian parliament created a huge stir in Austria, with some finding it controversial due to Austria's history of "neutrality" being interpreted in a political way. The pro-Russian leaning Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) protested against the speech by leaving the parliament. Outside the parliament, a rally was held against the speech by far-right, far-left, "peace activists," and conspiracy theorists.

What was particularly interesting was that over 50% of the Social Democratic MPs chose not to attend the speech, leading to a broad discussion about their relationship with Russia and the lack of solidarity towards Ukraine. As a result, five Austrian journalists contacted the speaker for information on pro-Russian narratives within the SPÖ. For the first time since the annexation of Crimea, a much-needed discourse has been initiated. Fortunately, many Social Democrats do not support the pro-Russian groups within their party, who claim to be "in favor of neutrality." In reality, these groups not only have a pro-Russian bias, but they also tend to defend or support countries like Venezuela, Cuba, China, or, in some cases, even Iran.

Austria does not have a communist party in parliament, unlike "the Left" in Germany, so such ideologies are present under the wing of the Social Democratic party for decades. Some SPÖ MPs refer to their critics as "NATO trolls," request to stop "war cruelties on both sides," and label President Zelensky's speech as "war propaganda in the parliament." They do not represent the entire party, which provides an opportunity for the Social Democrats to decide on a way of "democratic foreign policy," as one member of the party suggested.

Unfortunately, the lower ranks of the party appear even worse, particularly regarding social media, where some party members post "RT," Russian embassy content, conspiracy theories, and obscure Russian narratives. It is hoped that not only Austrian society but also the party itself will scrutinize these wings in the party and their role for the Social Democrats, who are already in crisis in Austria.

AUSTRIA'S GOVERNMENT NOT DOING ENOUGH TO COMBAT FOREIGN DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS

- How to fight against this propaganda?

- In Austria, we need a new discourse, a new style of discussion, especially after decades of praising neutrality. I am a member of a security initiative that asks for this new discourse and a new perception on how we should support our European partners and strengthen our security, especially towards Russia. We need to understand Media Literacy and Information Literacy as a matter of national security to protect our democracy. The European Union reacted already in 2014, but our national government did not understand how important this issue is becoming, especially since Russia annexed Crimea and increased activities in information warfare. Awareness for this issue is urgently needed. In the case of the Russian disinfo-campaign against Ukraine we need to educate the whole population in the big picture of what was happening and what is happening: Means from the annexation of Crimea, to the Russian aggression in Donbas, MH17, until the full-scale invasion 2022. What is also important to teach the audience about the situation in the occupied territories, the genocidal campaign by Russian propaganda and also the domestic situation in Russia, including jailing of people who are against the war.

- Does Austria have effective initiatives to increase media literacy and combat disinformation, and what role does the Austrian media play in this regard?

- Austria's efforts to establish media literacy or information literacy are superficial and not specialized in countering foreign disinformation. Moreover, the government has not made significant efforts to counter foreign disinformation campaigns by authoritarian regimes, particularly Russia. There is no task force in place, nor any information campaign to educate the population about the events in Ukraine since 2014.

While the media has started to address the issue of Russian disinformation more thoroughly, especially after the full-scale invasion in 2022, we need further efforts to show and explain the big picture of the Russian aggression against Ukraine since 2014, as significant knowledge gaps still exist.

Overall, Austria should prioritize developing more specialized approaches to counter foreign disinformation campaigns, and the government should take concrete steps to educate the public and raise awareness about these issues.

SANCTIONS AGAINST PROPAGANDISTS MAY BE PART OF THE SOLUTION

- Ukraine has vast experience in countering Russia's hybrid warfare, of which information warfare is also a part. Against this backdrop, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine launched the so-called "Information Ramstein" initiative to unite and better coordinate international efforts to counter Russian disinformation and propaganda and to support Ukrainian media. How do you feel about this initiative, and what do you see as its prospects?

- I believe that the idea of coordinating and sharing international efforts and experiences is always a good one, and we need plenty of forums to facilitate this. On one hand, we need to exchange information and provide regional experiences. On the other hand, we should not forget about reaching the general public, and not just “preaching to the converted”.

- As part of this "Information Ramstein" initiative, Ukraine proposes to its partners the idea of criminalizing articles against Russian propagandists at the international level and introducing the concept of the crime of using information weapons at the EU level. Can this work in the fight against Russian propaganda?

- We need a multilevel approach to effectively combat disinformation in the European Union. One factor can indeed be to identify propagandists and sanction them accordingly, especially when they are paid by foreign governments like Russia.

- How can EU legislation be improved to prevent disinformation campaigns in Europe?

- If individuals are paid by a foreign power to engage in propaganda here, the European Union should also have the means to respond accordingly. This also applies to the member states. However, freedom of expression is a valuable asset, which is why such measures must be carefully and cautiously considered.

UKRAINE NEEDS TO REACH PUBLIC OPINION IN BRAZIL, SOUTH AFRICA AND INDIA

- While Europeans already know who Ukrainians are and what kind of war is going on in the country, the situation in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is not the best in this regard because of the large presence of Russian media. What are your suggestions for conveying the truth about Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and countering Russian narratives in the countries of the so-called "Global South"?

- I believe that the Ukrainian government's initiative to improve and strengthen relations with African states is a positive step forward. Many countries in Africa are autocratic states, which makes Russia and China their "natural partners". This not only complicates the situation for Ukraine but also for other Western democracies. Given the Russian aggression, Ukraine could benefit from a pragmatic approach to building ties with these countries, something that the US, Germany, or the United Kingdom may find more challenging.

In my opinion, it is crucial for Ukraine to focus on countries such as Brazil, South Africa, and India. These countries are democracies, where public opinion has a significant influence on government decisions. If Ukraine can effectively communicate its message to the public in these countries, it may lead to a shift in political perspectives. This approach could also be applied to other countries in Central and South America.

Vienna, April 20 (TASR) - Europe sold its values for cheap Russian gas and oil in recent years, but democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law mustn't be sold for convenience - as Ukraine has shown Europe after it was attacked by Russia, interim Prime Minister Eduard Heger said in a lecture on Slovakia's vision for Europe at the Diplomatic Academy of Vienna on Wednesday evening.

According to Heger, the vision that European countries had in recent years has changed as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The focus has shifted from economic growth as the main objective to security.

Heger warned that in the event of a military victory in Ukraine, Russia would be Slovakia's neighbour and at the same time the security structure of Europe would fundamentally change. After the Russian invasion, NATO membership proved to be the only protection for Slovakia, the prime minister stressed, praising the Allies for sending troops and air defence systems to the country.

As for Slovakia's vision for Europe, Heger highlighted good neighbourly relations and unity in the European Union. The premier noted that the Union has already adopted ten sanction packages against Russia. In addition to sanctions, the EU is also helping Ukraine militarily and in humanitarian terms, he remarked.

Regarding EU enlargement, Heger warned that if the bloc does not have good relations with neighbouring countries, "someone else will". That is why, according to him, it is necessary to talk openly about enlargement with the Western Balkan countries. "It's not just a matter of growth and investment, it's also a matter of security," he added.

Companies in Europe are reporting progress on upgrades.

Spain's Repsol said it was retrofitting the hydro units at all five Spanish refineries it operates to increase its use of bio feedstock as the business was starting to give positive impetus to its refining margins.

Spanish refinery Cepsa has signed a joint venture agreement with the Spain-based subsidiary of Singapore's Apical for feedstock supply to its proposed 500,000 mt/year sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel plant at the Huelva refinery, the companies said April 14. Cepsa announced its intention to build the Eur1 billion ($1.1 billion) plant March 8, as it plans to produce 2.5 million mt/year of biofuel by 2030, including 800,000 mt/year of SAF.

The new plant will secure the majority of the feedstock supply from organic waste such as agricultural residue or used cooking oils through a global, long-term agreement with Apical, it said. The deal will enable it to address one of the key challenges in the biofuel industry -- the access to feedstock, Cepsa said. The new plant will include two pre-treatment units and the capacity for flexible production of 500,000 mt/year of SAF and renewable diesel for land, sea and air transportation. The plant is scheduled to begin operating in the first half of 2026.

Cepsa also said April 21 that it has completed a month-long maintenance at Huelva. The work entailed maintenance of units related with CO2 emissions reduction, safety systems and an increase of 2G biofuel capacity. A large part of the work took place in the hydrocracker unit to produce more biofuels from various renewable sources such as vegetable oil, it noted. The company previously carried out related conversion of its high pressure hydrotreatment unit to facilitate the processing of vegetable waste, it said.

Separately, Italy's Eni said that bio throughput in the first quarter rose 49% to 136,000 mt, while utilization was at 54%, up from 36%, as higher volumes were processed at the Gela biorefinery compared with Q1 2022 when it carried out maintenance, but were "partly offset" by lower throughput at the Venice plant.

Finnish refiner Neste reported strong refining and renewable products margins in the first quarter, noting that 2023 would be a "a year of growth" for its renewables business.

Neste said the Rotterdam expansion project was "proceeding well" and that its Singapore expansion started up production after mid-April. Its joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, started up its first phase in February.

"Together, the growth projects are targeting to increase our total nameplate capacity of renewable products to 5.5 million tons by the end of 2023," Neste said.

Renewables products' comparable sales margin was a "record high" at $945/mt, up from $783/mt as "the renewable diesel demand was robust and feedstock prices continued at a favorable level, as seen already in late 2022."

However, Neste said the sales volume for renewable diesel and SAF at 660,000 mt was lower year on year due to a fire at the Rotterdam facility in late 2022. It previously reported the fire at a processing unit at the plant in December that led to a month-long shutdown. Its renewables production facilities operated at an average 93% utilization rate in the first quarter, down from 104%.

Second-quarter volumes are expected to be 30%-50% higher than the first quarter, with the increase "subject to the ramp-up pace" of the capacity expansion in Singapore and its joint operation in Martinez.

"The second-quarter utilization rates of renewable production facilities are forecast to remain high, assuming a successful ramp-up of our new facilities both in Martinez, California and in Singapore," Neste said. It added that it has scheduled a five-week maintenance shutdown at the Singapore facility for the third quarter and a four-week maintenance shutdown at Rotterdam in the fourth quarter.

Neste reiterated that by increasing the SAF capabilities in Singapore and Rotterdam it was "targeting the optionality" to produce up to 1.5 million mt/year of SAF in 2024, which will reach 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026 when its nameplate capacity in renewable products is expected to increase to 6.8 million mt/year.

The Kazakh-Romanian Energy Investment Fund (KREIF) "has made considerable progress in commissioning the cogeneration plant," the company said in March 2023. The project, which started in May 2021, will ensure the refinery's energy needs "exclusively from the cogeneration plant," it said. The new facility will generate approximately 80 MW of electricity. The KREIF is owned by KMG International, a subsidiary of Kazakhstan's state-owned KazMunaiGaz, and the Romanian state.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a visbreaking unit at Plock. The visbreaking unit refinery will have a capacity to produce 200,000 mt/year of diesel. Ongoing modernization of the hydrocracking and diesel hydrodesulfurization units at Plock will also increase the refinery's diesel production capacity.

PKN Orlen has bought a license and base design from US engineering company KBR for a potential bottom-of-the-barrel project. If PKN takes a final investment decision, it will construct a production complex using solvent de-asphalting and fluid catalytic cracking technologies.

Separately, PKN Orlen has signed a contract with Linde to build a new oxygen and nitrogen production unit at its Plock refinery. The unit will produce 38,500 cu m/hour of oxygen and 75,000 cu m/hour of nitrogen, supplying gas feedstock for the new Olefin III complex and other installations at Plock. The project is due to be completed by the start of 2025.

** Poland's PKN Orlen said it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil products loading terminal in Gdansk. PKN said both investments are scheduled to be commissioned by mid-2025. The hydrocracking base oils project will help the company diversify into second- and third-generation base oils.

** The expansion of Orlen Unipetrol's steam cracker at Litvinov is still ongoing, the company said Dec. 2022. The company said in October 2021 it was contracting Technip Energies to build a new steam cracker furnace to be commissioned in 2022. The construction of an 11th furnace is set to boost production capacity to 585,000 mt/year of ethylene from 545,000 mt/year. The company plans to increase total petrochemical production capacity to 1.4 million mt/year by 2030 from 900,000 mt/year.

PKN Orlen has completed the Czech Koruna 9.6 billion ($410 million) polyethylene 3 unit investment at Litvinov. The refinery's owner, Unipetrol, a 100%-owned PKN subsidiary, has taken charge of the black polyethylene unit, the second part of the investment. The first part, the natural polyethylene unit, was completed in April 2020. The polyethylene 3 unit, which can produce 270,000 mt/year of high density polyethylene, will replace production of one of the two existing production units with a capacity of 120,000 mt/year. Litvinov's polyethylene capacity will increase from 320,000 mt/year to 470,000 mt/year. PKN Orlen was launching construction of a unit at Litvinov to produce up to 26,000 mt/year of dicyclopentadiene, or DCPC, used in the automotive, construction and electronic industries. Separately, McDermott International has been awarded a contract for engineering, procurement and construction management services for an upgrade of the hydrocracker at the Litvinov refinery.

BIOFUEL, HYDROGEN UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** Repsol said it was retrofitting the hydro units in all five Spanish refineries it operates to increase its use of bio feedstock as the business was starting to give positive impetus to its refining margins. Mild hydrocracker units at A Coruna, Bilbao and Puertollano as well as hydrocrackers at Cartagena and Tarragona will all be modified with no real capex impact, CEO Josu Jon Imaz said.

Separately, Repsol would take a final investment decision in H2 2023 on 350 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity spread across Cartagena, Tarragona and Bilbao, all of which are entering their engineering phase.

** The European Commission has approved a Eur158 million Polish green hydrogen support package for Poland's Gdansk refinery under state aid rules, it said in April 2023. PKN Orlen via its LOTOS Green H2 subsidiary plans a 100 MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen used in refinery processes as well as a 50 MW solar power plant and 20 MWh battery storage, it said. The electrolyzer is expected to start operating in 2027 and gradually increase production to 13,600 mt/year.

** Finnish refiner Neste said it has decided to "proceed to the basic engineering phase" of a 120 MW electrolyzer project at its Porvoo refinery aimed to produce green hydrogen. If an investment decision is made in 2024, production could start in 2026.

The green hydrogen would be used primarily in Porvoo to replace hydrogen produced from fossil fuel and will support the company's goal "to transform the Porvoo refinery to the most sustainable refinery in Europe by 2030," it said.

Finland's Neste has successfully concluded its second series of "industrial-scale processing runs with liquefied waste plastic" at the Porvoo refinery after carrying out the first processing run in 2020. The current processing uses the existing refinery equipment but ultimately Neste aims to establish large-scale capacities to process 400,000 mt/yr of liquefied waste plastic. From 2030 it wants to process more than 1 million mt/yr of waste plastic.

The aim is part of Neste's strategic study to transform Porvoo into "a renewable and circular solutions site and possibly end crude oil refining by the mid-2030s," it also said.

The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

** Finland's Neste said in its Q1 2023 financial report that the Rotterdam expansion project is "proceeding well" and that its Singapore expansion started up production after mid-April. Its joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, started up its first phase in February. "Together, the growth projects are targeting to increase our total nameplate capacity of renewable products to 5.5 million tons by the end of 2023," Neste said. Neste reiterated that by increasing the SAF capabilities in Singapore and Rotterdam it is "targeting the optionality" to produce up to 1.5 million mt/year of SAF in 2024, which will reach 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026 when its nameplate capacity in renewable products is expected to increase to 6.8 million mt/year.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** BP plans to invest up to Eur2 billion in a green hydrogen plant at Spanish Castellon to replace the existing fossil-based hydrogen plant, it said in February 2023. Under the project, BP said it plans a phased development of up to 2 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030. The project will also see Castellon's production of biofuels triple to 650,000 mt/year by 2030 with the green hydrogen used as a feedstock in biofuel production, specifically of SAF. The first phase of the project will see the installation of an electrolysis plant with at least 200 MW capacity operational by 2027, with production of up to 31,200 mt/year of green hydrogen. In a second phase, to be completed in 2030, the electrolysis plant would be expanded to reach a capacity of up to 2 GW. BP has created a joint venture with Iberdrola covering Spain, Portugal and the UK to produce green ammonia and methanol as well as 600,000 mt/year of hydrogen. The refinery also has a target to triple sustainable jet fuel output to 15,000 b/d as part of its overall decarbonization program.

** Cepsa said March 8 it will build a new unit to produce second generation biofuel at the Huelva refinery with an investment of Eur1 billion ($1.1 billion). The plant will produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, creating 1,600 jobs, Cepsa said. The biofuels will be produced from organic waste, including used cooking oil and agricultural residues.

The plant will contribute to Cepsa's strategy to reach 2.5 million mt/year of biofuel production by 2030, making it a leader in the Iberian peninsula. The total will include 800,000 mt/year of SAF.

The refinery is also planning to start up 400 MW of hydrogen production capacity by 2026, having signed agreements in January and February 2023 with local partners.

Cepsa has already signed an agreement with the Port of Rotterdam to create the first green hydrogen corridor between southern and northern Europe, allowing the export of green ammonia and methanol.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a hydrotreated vegetable oils installation at Plock. PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery. The unit will process used rapeseed oil to produce an additive to diesel or aviation fuel. The annual production of the unit will be 300,000 mt of biodiesel or aviation biofuel. The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a bioethanol unit at the company's small Polish biofuels plant, Orlen Poludnie. PKN Orlen is also constructing a hydrogen plant at its Poludnie biorefinery in Trzebinia. Annual production will be 16 million cu m, and three-quarters of that will be used to produce glycol. The remainder will be used to produce 45 kg/h of fuel-grade hydrogen for use in transport.

** PKN Orlen said its subsidiary Orlen Poludnie has signed an agreement to build a "complex of units for production of II generation bioethanol" at its biofuel refinery in Jedlicze, southern Poland. The B2G complex will include a main unit for bioethanol production and will have the capacity to produce 25,000 mt/year of bioethanol from biomass. In the next stage, a biogas plant will be built. The biomass will be mainly cereals straw sourced from Polish farmers. The bioethanol complex will also include a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant, which will generate heat for bioethanol production. The Jedlicze refinery is a small former petroleum refinery, which together with the Trzebinia refinery, was incorporated into Orlen Poludnie, the company's biofuels subsidiary.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

In Oct. 2021, Gunvor said it had agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Phillips 66 is looking at carbon capture and storage as well as electrolytic green hydrogen production to decarbonize operations at its Humber refinery in the UK, Commercial Manager for Emerging Energy Mike Wailes said Feb. 2023. The initial focus is on post-combustion capture from the refining process, including from the crude topping unit, fluid catalytic cracker and hydro-desulfurization unit, with further more expensive options coming from refueling to use hydrogen, he said.

The refinery is part of the East Coast Cluster industrial decarbonization hub, selected for funding support under the UK government's first phase of CCS cluster sequencing.

Phillips 66 is developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to be powered by offshore wind which can be scalable to 300 MW.

The refinery is the only UK SAF producer, Wailes said.

The Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways in early 2022.

Phillips 66 has said previously its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Portugal's Galp said it expects to sanction key projects in 2023, including 270,000 mt/year production of HVO capacity for producing advanced biodiesel and SAF, with a final investment decision expected in the year. In terms of green hydrogen, it also expects to take FID on a 100 MW Sines hydrogen production plant during 2023, targeting an eventual roll out of up to 700 MW to the end of the decade. The 100-MW Sines electrolyzer project will target to replace existing conventional hydrogen production. Previously, Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub.

** Spain's Repsol is to build a new 25,000 mt/year production line for recycled polyethylene at its Puertollano site. The new line, which will produce high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) with a recycled plastic content of 10%-80%, was expected to come into operation by the end of 2024. Current capacity for the plastics production at the site is 16,000 mt/year. Puertollano is also due to start a first polyurethane foam recovery plant this year at Puertollano while it also has plans to build a new unit to produce 15,000 mt/year of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) to come online in 2024 with an investment of Eur105 million.

** Renewable hydrogen company Everfuel has signed an agreement in Jan. 2023 to supply oxygen to an undisclosed company from its HySynergy electrolyzer in Fredericia, Denmark, enabling a higher utilization of the plant. The conditional agreement will improve the overall utilization and efficiency of the second phase of the electrolyzer, providing a long-term revenue stream, Everfuel said. HySynergy 2.0 will extend the existing 20 MW electrolyzer with 300 MW of additional capacity by 2025. It will be developed with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia and will produce hydrogen to decarbonize industrial processes and transportation. The first 20-MW phase started hydrogen production in December, with first commercial deliveries due in 2023. The plant, adjacent to the Fredericia oil refinery, will supply renewable hydrogen to the facility and for local zero-emissions transport, Everfuel said. The plant will send 80% of the hydrogen produced to the refinery for use as a feedstock in the refining process. The remaining 20% will go to hydrogen mobility applications. Phase two is to be built in three 100-MW stages.

** Spain's Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for its planned 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

Other projects include a 2,100 mt/year synthetic fuel plant and supporting hydrogen infrastructure to come online from 2024.

A separate plant, costing Eur20 million is contemplated to generate gas to feed the refinery from urban waste and should be online by 2025.

** Piling work for a new biofuel plant being built by Shell at the site of Europe's biggest refinery, Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam (formerly Pernis), was due to be completed around summer 2023, with the new plant expected to start up in 2024 or 2025. Shell is building an 820,000 mt/year biofuel plant in Rotterdam to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste. The facility will not use virgin palm oil as a feedstock although it will process vegetable oils, such as rapeseed, to supplement the waste feedstocks "until even more sustainable advanced feedstocks are widely available," it said.

** Repsol along with Spanish companies Naturgy and Reganosa plan to construct a hydrogen electrolyzer at Meirama, close to the A Coruna plant, with the output used to feed the refinery. The first phase of the project will see 30 MW of installed capacity by 2025 at the site of a closed thermal power plant. A subsequent upgrade will take the project to 200 MW capacity, producing 30,000 mt of green hydrogen per year. A newly installed hydrotreatment unit at Spain's A Coruna that processes vegetable and cooking oils was expected to boost biofuel output by 5,500 mt/year in 2022, with the volume rising to 10,500 mt/year by 2024.

** Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery. The contract covers engineering, procurement and construction assistance for the conversion of Grandpuits "into a zero-crude platform oriented towards SAF," it said. Once in operation, the facility will have the capacity to produce 210,000 mt/year of SAF from sustainable feedstock such as used cooking oil and animal fat. Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in Q1 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform, starting in 2024.

Separately, Air Liquide is to invest over Eur130 million ($134 million) in a low-carbon hydrogen unit at the Grandpuits biorefinery. TotalEnergies has committed to buy the hydrogen under a long-term contract to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The new reforming unit, with capacity to produce over 20,000 mt/year of hydrogen, will partly recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, in place of the natural gas it normally uses.

TotalEnergies also said that its zero-crude project at Grandpuits "is based on the development of several future-oriented activities" which include chemical recycling of plastic waste, production of biosourced and biodegradable bioplastics, production of biofuels for the aviation sector, construction of a solar farm and electricity storage by batteries. The new units will be starting up from 2022 and are expected to be operational by 2025.

** Turkey's Tupras said it had completed basic engineering studies to produce sustainable aviation fuel at its Izmir refinery using Honeywell's UOP ecofining technology. Tupras said it plans eventually to produce 400,000 mt/year of SAF, renewable diesel and other products at Izmir.

** Croatia's INA is studying various options for its Sisak refinery, including a biorefinery, biogas plant and production of pure hydrogen.

** Italy's Eni said it was "investigating the opportunity to build a new bio-refinery at Eni's industrial site in Livorno." It will be Eni's third biorefinery in Italy after converting its Gela and Venice refineries into biofuel plants. Eni said its feasibility study involves building "three new plants for the production of hydrogenated biofuel: a biogenic feedstock pre-treatment unit, a 500,000 mt/year Ecofining plant and a plant for the production of hydrogen from methane gas." The design of the three plants will be completed by 2023 and construction by 2025. Local officials welcomed the potential conversion of the Livorno refinery into a biorefinery as it would maintain "the current workforce and the entire production chain."

** Italy's Eni has started producing SAF at its Taranto refinery in southern Italy, as part of its commitment to decarbonize all its products and processes by 2050. Eni plans to increase its bio-refining capacity to 5 million-6 million mt/year by 2050. Eni targets its SAF capacity to reach at least 500,000 mt/year by 2030. Eni said its SAF production will continue to grow with the start-up of over 10,000 mt/year of SAF from its Livorno refinery using bio-components produced in Eni's existing Gela and Venice bio-refineries. In 2024, Eni plans to launch SAF production at the Gela bio-refinery, where a project is underway for a further 150,000 mt/year of SAF production from 100% renewable raw materials by 2025.

** Italy's Eni said that it will install a 20 MW electrolyzer at its Gela biorefinery and a 10 MW electrolyzer at its Taranto refinery. The electrolyzers will be part of a project to develop green hydrogen by Enel Green Power and Eni which will receive public funding approved by the European Commission.

** Ineos has awarded a design contract for a planned 190,000 mt/year low-carbon hydrogen production plant at its Grangemouth refining and petrochemical site in Scotland to engineering company Atkins. The plant is expected to be operational by 2030.

** Essar, the owner of the UK's Stanlow refinery, said it has received a hydrogen-powered furnace, which is the first in the UK. The furnace has been commissioned by Essar Oil UK "as it transitions to run its operations on hydrogen as part of HyNet, the UK's leading decarbonization cluster," it said. The furnace, which will run on 100% hydrogen fuel from 2026, "forms a central part of Essar's strategy at Stanlow to become the UK's first low-carbon refinery." The furnace will replace three gas-fired furnaces at the plant's crude distillation unit. Essar is also developing 300,000 cu m of biofuel storage capacity at the site, allowing customers to store, blend and distribute biofuels for the road, aviation and marine sectors. It will become the UK's largest biofuels storage facility when completed.

** OMV Petrom will start producing SAF at its Petrobrazi refinery, which will become the first refinery in Romania to produce the fuel. The refinery will produce SAF by coprocessing locally produced rapeseed oil. In the future, it aims to increase the production capacities and produce sustainable fuels based on various waste feedstocks, such as used cooking oil. "Our goal is that, in 2030, to have an annual combined production of SAF and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil) of about 450 thousand tons," Radu Caprau, member of the Executive Board responsible for Refining & Marketing said.

** Repsol and partners Enerkem and Agbar have presented a project to transform 400,000 mt/year of urban waste to 220,000 mt/year methanol at Tarragona, which should start up in 2025 with an investment of Eur250 million. Spain's Tarragona has started on a series of energy transition projects, including the manufacture of biofuel for aviation and an advanced biofuels plant, which is already under construction. The refinery plans to build a 100-MW hydrogen electrolyzer by 2025.

** Hungarian oil and gas group MOL will build a 10-MW electrolyzer for renewable hydrogen production at its Danube refinery in Szazhalombatta, Hungary. The electrolyzers from US company Plug Power will produce 1,600 mt/year of green hydrogen, with operations starting in 2023.

** OMV said that together with AEG Fuels it will supply SAF from its Schwechat refinery on-demand for the "general aviation segment" to be used as an alternative to conventional jet fuel at the Vienna International Airport. SAF is produced at Schwechat by co-processing Austrian used cooking oil and is supplied via a direct pipeline connection to Vienna's international airport. OMV had also supplied the first batch of SAF to Vienna International Airport for fueling Austrian Airlines aircraft. Schwechat has received the two main components for producing SAF -- the reactor and column. From mid-2023 up to 160,000 mt of liquid biomass will be converted into SAF using an innovative co-processing method, it said. "The new reactor will process substances including vegetable oil together with other feedstocks in a procedure known as co-processing. This innovative process involves refining the biogenic feedstock via a hydrogenation process using hydrogen," OMV said. In the future, the process can be used for processing other feedstock such as used cooking oil or advanced bio-fuels. OMV plans to increase its SAF sales to more than 700,000 mt/year by 2030. Separately, OMV will build the country's largest electrolysis plant at the Schwechat refinery through a joint investment with Kommunalkredit Austria AG. The plant is expected to start in H2 2023. The 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis will produce up to 1,500 mt/year of green hydrogen.

** Germany's Bayernoil is looking at producing SAF from sewage sludge. It could convert 100,000 mt of sewage sludge into SAF annually under Project Bayosine. The processing, which involves pyrolisis, can be done in a new unit at the Vohburg site of the plant.

** Sweden's Preem aims to expand the HVO capacity at its Gothenburg plant from 320,000 cu m/year to 1.3 million cu m/year in 2026. "This is planned to take place in a completely new facility designed to produce renewable vehicle fuels and aviation fuels with great flexibility," it said. In its Lysekil plant, production of HVO from the Synsat plant "was the highest to date," the company said. Preem is rebuilding the existing Synsat plant, so it can produce renewable raw materials and replace part of the fossil production. It is expected to reach renewable production capacity of 950,000 cu m/year by 2024.

** Finland's UPM expects its Leuna biorefinery in Germany to be operational by the end of 2023 and ramp up in 2024. Construction of the facility, which will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals, started in 2020. Its total annual capacity will be 220,000 mt bio-monoethylene glycol and lignin-based renewable functional fillers. It will also produce monopropylene glycol and industrial sugars made from sustainably harvested beechwood sourced regionally in Germany.

** Greece's Motor Oil Hellas said its Corinth refinery by 2030 aims to enhance its pure hydrogen infrastructure through demonstration and scale-up of green hydrogen. In the long term, it aims to be a "large producer of clean hydrogen".

** France's TotalEnergies said it has "successfully started production" of SAF at its Gonfreville refinery in Normandy. The new site complements the biojet production capacities of the company's La Mede refinery and the Oudalle plant. All the biojet will be supplied to French airports and will be produced from waste and residue sourced from the circular economy. La Mede, in the south of France, and Oudalle, near Le Havre, began producing SAF in April 2021. La Mede stopped processing crude oil at the end of 2016 and was converted into a bio plant in 2019.

** Repsol's Cartagena has started construction of its planned second-generation biofuel plant at the nearby to the refinery Escombreras facility, which should result in the production of 250,000 mt/year of biodiesel from waste from mid-2023. The company will invest Eur200 million in the project that would output biodiesel, biojet, bionaphtha and biopropane, allowing an overall CO2 reduction of 900,000 mt/year. As part of its drive to decarbonize the refinery, Repsol also plans to build a 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer at Cartagena, with a target date of 2025.

** Orsted and BP are to jointly develop a 50 MW renewable hydrogen project at BP's Lingen refinery in Germany. The project, expected to be operational in 2024, would comprise a 50 MW electrolyzer capable of generating 9,000 mt/year of hydrogen, 20% of the refinery's current fossil-based hydrogen consumption. The electrolyzer is expected to be powered by an Orsted North Sea offshore wind farm. The partners have a longer-term ambition to build more than 500 MW of renewable hydrogen capacity at Lingen, providing renewable hydrogen to meet all the refinery's hydrogen demand and provide feedstock for future synthetic fuel production.

** Italian energy company Eni and SEA, the operator of Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, have signed an agreement to supply SAF for commercial flights, as a step towards accelerating the "ecological transition" of the two airports. Eni plans to develop Eni Biojet which will be made "exclusively" from used cooking oil or animal fats and can be "used in a blend with conventional jet fuel of up to 50%," Umberto Carrara, Director of Green/Traditional Refining and Market at Eni said. The company plans to produce around 200,000 mt/year by 2024 and double the production by 2030.

** BP has partnered with Dutch green hydrogen company HyCC to develop its 250-MW H2-Fifty electrolyzer project in Rotterdam. The companies will next select a technology partner for the previously announced renewable hydrogen project and begin environmental studies, with a final investment decision expected in 2023. The project is expected to come online in 2025. The renewable hydrogen produced at the facility will replace fossil-based feedstock at BP's Rotterdam refinery and other industries in the area. The plant will be situated in the Maasvlakte area of Rotterdam.

** Russia's Lukoil said in December 2021 that it has signed memorandum of intent with Rusatom Overseas, part of the Rosatom Group, to cooperate in the production and supply of green hydrogen for the company's Petrotel refinery in Ploesti, Romania.

** Varo Energy's Cressier refinery in Switzerland will use solar panel generated electricity by 19,000 photovoltaic panels for a "significant portion" of the electricity it consumes. Varo Energy Group and Groupe E will build the "most powerful ground-mounted solar facility in Switzerland" with an installed capacity of 7.7 MW. It will be built in the industrial zone east of the refinery. At full power the park will be able to supply more than 60% of the refinery's needs.

** ExxonMobil, Macquarie's Green Investment Group, and SGN are studying the potential for a low-carbon hydrogen hub centered around ExxonMobil's Fawley refinery on the UK's south coast. Initial hydrogen production could be around 4.3 TWh/year from 2030. Hydrogen demand in the Southampton industrial cluster around the refinery could reach 37 TWh by 2050.

** Italy's Saras is working on activating a green hydrogen plant for a total of 20 MW. Saras is building the green hydrogen plant with Italian utility Enel. The hydrogen produced would be used at the Sarroch refinery. It is currently provided by the IGCC complex and two reforming units on the industrial site.

** The Refhyne II consortium, developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for Shell's Rheinland refinery in Germany at its Wesseling site, has received a Eur32.4 million grant from the EU. The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies will stop using palm oil at La Mede from 2023. The biorefinery has already significantly reduced the amount of palm oil it processes from 500,000 mt/year initially to 100,000 mt/year in 2021. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen at Gdansk. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

LAUNCHES

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Turkey's Ersan Petrol is still hopeful of its plans for a 1.4 million mt/year refinery at Kahramanmaras in southeast Turkey will be able to go ahead despite repeated delays and a difficult investment climate. Project coordinator Cenk Pala said Ersan was in talks with prospective partners and sources of finance for the project and hopes to start work on the FEED study this year. The refinery is planned for a 300,000 sq m site in Kahramanmaras which holds a defunct mini refinery that will be dismantled. A pre-feasibility study by Axens has defined the configuration and capacity of the plant which will produce mainly Euro 5 diesel, Euro 5 gasoline, jet and bitumen.

** A new greenfield Porto Romano refinery in Albania will be predominantly oriented to export markets but will also be able to cover Albania's domestic demand, Helmut Mayrhofer, consultant at Larkalis said. Austria-based consultancy Larkalis is leading an international consortium working on the project which will involve building the refinery in the port town of Durres. The refinery has a two-year construction authorization and could be commissioned by end-2025, depending on international developments.

** Azeri state oil company Socar is considering developing a second refinery in Turkey, in addition to its existing 214,000 b/d Star refinery at Aliaga on Turkey's central Aegean coast.

Schrödinger’s bank . How Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank is (not) leaving Russia after a year of war

After a year of war in Ukraine, Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) AG has announced its gradual withdrawal from Russia. The news came in late March at a shareholders’ meeting where Raiffeisen CEO Johann Strobl announced[https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/raiffeisen-pursue-possible-sale-or-spin-off-russia-business-2023-03-30/] that the company was considering either selling its subsidiary bank in Russia or withdrawing this asset from the group. Experts describe Raiffeisen’s departure as a disaster that would bring the country closer to de facto disconnection from SWIFT and seriously complicate Russian business deals with its remaining foreign partners.

Raiffeisen has faced a dilemma in recent months. On the one hand, it has been under increasing pressure from international players — above all the European Central Bank and the US Treasury — and on the other hand, it is being held back by record profits in Russia and unfavourable exit conditions. Given this situation, the sensational announcement may not be as straightforward as it seems: while demonstrating its determination to leave, Raiffeisen may actually try to delay the process for as long as possible, taking the wait-and-see approach.

Novaya Gazeta Europe correspondent Darya Kozlova has outlined different scenarios for the future of Raiffeisen in Russia, showing how Russian regulators have managed to lock the bank in a gilded cage.

Illustration: Alisa Krasnikova.[https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/177e2c4f809a4ae7ab9322dcb496f8cf.jpeg]

In mid-April, a construction crane removed[https://t.me/rtvimain/72219] the huge Raiffeisen Bank sign from a building in central Moscow. This came two weeks after it finally became clear that RBI had decided to leave Russia. The process of leaving the Russian market may take up to seven months. The bank has pledged to start reducing its business activity in Russia.

After the announcement, the bank’s subsidiary decided[https://t.me/rtvimain/72219] that it was now pointless to maintain brand recognition and did not extend contracts for rooftop ads.

The first step towards closing the business was the restriction of SWIFT-transfers in dollars for a large portion of the bank’s clients and raising the minimum sum for dollar and euro transfers — first to 10,000[https://www.raiffeisen.ru/about/press/news/201876/] and then to 20,000[https://www.raiffeisen.ru/about/press/news/201882/] (the restrictions on other currencies remained the same)

According[https://www.ft.com/content/1cea1f08-83ac-4471-9fa4-1cdfcc86fcb0] to the Financial Times, Raiffeisen Bank now accounts for 40-50% of all payments between Russia and the rest of the world. Their SWIFT transfers usually take days and sometimes only a few hours, making Raiffeisen one of the easiest and most accessible tools to get money out of Russia.

Andrey Barkhota, a financial market expert, believes the restrictions on currency transfers are a signal to international regulators that the bank is serious about its decision. It can be interpreted as a willingness to comply with the sanctions — in order to do so the bank is even refusing to provide services that it has effectively monopolised.

But one should not expect the bank to leave Russia in the near future. According to Barkhota, it is likely that Raiffeisen will delay „

the process as long as possible. This is motivated both by the restrictions of Russian regulators, who have effectively taken foreign companies hostage, and by the profits the bank makes in Russia.

In 2022, its operation in the Russian market brought[https://www.ft.com/content/1cea1f08-83ac-4471-9fa4-1cdfcc86fcb0] the company a record €2.2 billion — more than 60% of its total profits. How much the restrictions will cut into the bank’s revenues is not clear: the new conditions still allow large transfers from individuals and legal entities — importers who need cross-border transfers and who would suffer[https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5839439] from the bank’s withdrawal.

Both the SWIFT restrictions and the dismantling of rooftop signs are demonstrative actions meant to assure Western countries of the bank’s impending withdrawal from Russia. Monopolists do not need advertisements.

The end of stability 

The history of Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank — one of the largest banks in Central and Eastern Europe — dates back to the late 19th century. The bank entered the Russian market in 1996 under the name Raiffeisenbank Austria.

By 2007, Raiffeisen was Russia’s largest bank with foreign capital, boasting[https://www.raiffeisen.ru/about/press/releases/2002/] more than 1.3 million clients.

Herbert Stepic. Photo: REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader.[https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/7411a8900e5544b781a28194eb7f3a82.jpeg]

Business was going very well. In an interview[https://www.banki.ru/news/interview/?id=4589631utm_source=google.comutm_medium=organicutm_campaign=google.comutm_referrer=google.com] with Vedomosti in February 2013, the former head of the bank, Herbert Stepic, could not name any downside to operating in Russia. Although he said that the government needed to fix the legal system to ensure economic development, he saw good future opportunities in Russia. „

“The most important prerequisite for the country’s economic growth is stability. You see, countries that have instability don’t get direct investments, because nobody invests in an insecure market.

Stability has emerged under Putin’s rule (and I know it wasn’t there before). This means that Russian and international companies can work — and have been working for years, I would say quite safely — in a stable environment,” Stepic said at the time.

By 2022, Raiffeisen’s subsidiary had 90 branches across Russia and a client base of more than 4 million. Raiffeisen was the tenth[http://www.finmarket.ru/database/rankings/] largest bank in terms of assets.

However, with the outbreak of full-scale war in Ukraine, the stability of the Russian market ended.

A trap for foreigners

When foreign companies started their mass exodus from Russia in the first weeks of the war, Raiffeisen Bank decided to continue operations and agreed to the restrictions imposed by the Russian Central Bank.

According to Forbes, bank executives told[https://www.forbes.ru/finansy/486203-bankovskij-pat-pocemu-rajffajzenbanku-slozno-ujti-iz-rossii] investors in early March that they had no intention of leaving the market and that the Russian subsidiary could still make a profit under such conditions.

There were indeed profits even during the first weeks of panic after 24 February. Although the number of the bank’s clients in Russia dropped[https://www.rbinternational.com/en/investors/presentations-webcasts/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/contentcontainer/contentbox/downloadlist_copy_co.download.html/0/May%2525202022.pdf] by 600,000 (14.7%) in the first quarter of 2022 and was even lower than in early 2021, the net profit remained at a level comparable to the same period of the previous year: €96 mln in the first three months.

Johann Strobl. Photo: Raiffeisen Bank .[https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/6f9e4e86704c4de9b35197d2647c19f2.jpeg]

Raiffeisen announced[https://www.rbinternational.com/en/investors/news/ir-releases/2022-03-17_RU_UA_strategic_options.html] in mid-March 2022 that it was considering a “carefully planned exit” from Russia. Raiffeisen CEO Johann Strobl then revealed that the group had received “non-binding offers” to buy the subsidiary.

But the group did not take active steps to leave Russia (at least publicly) even when other foreign players began doing so in various ways.

Raiffeisen Bank continued to operate in Russia during all this time and made record profits. RBI’s profits[https://www.ft.com/content/1cea1f08-83ac-4471-9fa4-1cdfcc86fcb0] in 2022 were two and a half times what they were in 2021 (€1.4 billion). Most of these profits came from Russia. The success was largely due to sanctions that unplugged many Russian banks from SWIFT.

For the most part, the organisation has been unable to withdraw profits from the Russian market: last year, Russia introduced regulations allowing residents from “unfriendly” countries to receive dividends only into bank accounts from which funds cannot be transferred abroad. In December, the law was relaxed[https://www.rbc.ru/economics/23/12/2022/63a414da9a79475b91011b6a?from=newsfeed] somewhat, allowing to withdraw up to half of one’s income from Russia, but only for companies that intend to continue operating in Russia.

Raiffeisen also had big losses: the reputational cost of continuing to operate in Russia had caused the company’s shares to plummet[https://www.ft.com/content/1cea1f08-83ac-4471-9fa4-1cdfcc86fcb0] by more than 40 percent since the war began.

Russian regulators also gradually reduced the freedom for foreign firms to withdraw from the market.

In August 2022, Vladimir Putin signed[http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/Document/View/0001202208050002] a decree prohibiting the sale of certain financial institutions (including the subsidiaries of foreign banks) until the end of the year without special presidential approval. Later, the document was extended[https://tass.ru/ekonomika/16508873] till the end of 2023.

According to Russian Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev, this decision was a reaction[https://www.rbc.ru/finances/08/09/2022/6318b5e79a794747167dd6a4] to the Western ban on Russian banks operating abroad. Subsidiaries of banks VTB and Otkritie, for example, had their European assets blocked[https://www.rbc.ru/politics/08/04/2022/625085139a7947671566725f].

Barkhota believes that Russia’s retaliatory measure against non-residents could force Western countries to start a dialogue on exchanging the assets of Russian banks stuck in Europe for the assets of foreign banks in Russia.

In effect, Russia has taken foreign subsidiaries hostage for the purpose of the exchange. Raiffeisen was one of those banks trapped this way.

Between a rock and a hard place

“A bank is not a sausage stand that you can close in a week”, Strobl told[https://www.ft.com/content/1cea1f08-83ac-4471-9fa4-1cdfcc86fcb0] an FT reporter last March in reference to Raiffeisen’s fate in Russia.

Economist Oleg Vyugin believes that the Raiffeisen had initially planned to wait out the war crisis: “Apparently, they hoped that business as usual would continue and the situation would resolve itself.”

Ivan Fedyakov, founder and head of the INFOLine analytical agency, explains that the fact that Raiffeisen was not under sanctions made it an important thread of connections, including financial ones, which allowed European countries to interact with foreign companies in Russia and help them leave. But, as Fedyakov points out, the banking group has spent too much time in Russia. The profits that it made off the state of affairs have irked many across the globe.

Back in Austria, Raiffeisen has been under no pressure since the war began. In an interview[https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000144186220/aussenminister-schallenberg-zu-rbi-in-russland-ein-exempel-zu-statuieren] with Der Standard in March, Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said that the bank had the right to choose its own strategy for operating in Russia and approved of the organisation’s wait-and-see tactics.

Schallenberg also pointed out that, according to the Swiss IMD and the University of St Gallen, less than 9% of foreign companies, including banks, have left[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4322502] Russia. For example, Hungary’s OTP Bank and Italy’s UniCredit continue to operate, although they too are considering[https://journal.tinkoff.ru/news/review-banks-2023/] an exit.

Nor has there been pressure from other politicians: according[https://www.ft.com/content/1cea1f08-83ac-4471-9fa4-1cdfcc86fcb0] to FT, many Austrian ministers and MPs are closely linked to Raiffeisen, which is the “home bank” for the ruling centre-right Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP).

Globally, however, the reaction to Raiffeisen’s continued operations in Russia has been somewhat different. In February 2023, Ukraine introduced sanctions against the bank’s top management. In addition, Reuters reported, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury launched an investigation[https://www.reuters.com/business/us-sanctions-authority-asks-raiffeisen-about-business-related-russia-2023-02-17/] in connection with the bank’s Russian business. OFAC asked the bank for details of its operations in Russia, the partially occupied Donbas, Ukraine, and Syria, including transaction details of certain clients. At the end of March, Reuters also reported[https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/ecb-pressures-austrias-raiffeisen-bank-quit-russia-sources-2023-03-23/] that the European Central Bank had demanded that Raiffeisen leave the Russian market or at least provide an exit plan.

Political scientist and European politics expert Tatiana Romanova[http://sir.spbu.ru/profs/?id=172] points out that the international outcry was due not so much to the bank securing transactions from Russia but rather to its providing[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/loans-russian-soldiers-fuel-calls-european-banks-quit-2023-02-13/] payment holidays for mobilised Russians. „

Like all banks in Russia, Raiffeisen’s subsidiary had to offer this service, which to the rest of the world means indirect support for the war in Ukraine.

Attitudes towards Raiffeisen could also potentially be influenced by the political situation around Austria itself. For the Kremlin, it is still a non-NATO country. Furthermore, Austria’s policy towards Russia has traditionally been seen as pragmatic. The Austrian parliament includes the right-populist Freedom Party (FPÖ), a pro-Kremlin[https://www.dw.com/ru/%2525D0%2525B4%2525D1%252580%2525D1%252583%2525D0%2525B7%2525D1%25258C%2525D1%25258F-%2525D0%2525BF%2525D1%252583%2525D1%252582%2525D0%2525B8%2525D0%2525BD%2525D0%2525B0-%2525D0%2525B2-%2525D0%2525B0%2525D0%2525B2%2525D1%252581%2525D1%252582%2525D1%252580%2525D0%2525B8%2525D0%2525B8-%2525D0%2525BF%2525D1%252580%2525D0%2525B0%2525D0%2525B2%2525D1%25258B%2525D0%2525B5-%2525D0%2525BF%2525D0%2525BE%2525D0%2525BF%2525D1%252583%2525D0%2525BB%2525D0%2525B8%2525D1%252581%2525D1%252582%2525D1%25258B-%2525D0%2525B2-%2525D1%252588%2525D0%2525B0%2525D0%2525B3%2525D0%2525B5-%2525D0%2525BE%2525D1%252582-%2525D0%2525B2%2525D0%2525BB%2525D0%2525B0%2525D1%252581%2525D1%252582%2525D0%2525B8/a-40938855] EU party that even had a cooperation agreement with the ruling United Russia party from 2016 to 2021. FPÖ now takes a neutral stance on the war in Ukraine, but that still plays[https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2023/02/27/putins-sidekicks-en] into Putin’s hands: in the European Parliament, for instance, FPÖ delegates very rarely oppose anti-Russian resolutions, in many cases abstaining from voting. And in an Austrian parliamentary session this March, members of the FPÖ left the room[https://strana.today/news/429801-deputaty-avstrijskoj-partii-svobody-pokinuli-parlament-vo-vremja-obrashchenija-zelenskoho.html] during an address by Volodymyr Zelensky.

Though the FPÖ is now in opposition in Austria, the Kremlin can still see the ruling centre-right ÖVP as a force to be negotiated with. Austria, like Switzerland, has a policy of neutrality[https://www.svoboda.org/a/chutj-luchshe-chem-orban-avstriya-ne-speshit-podderzhivatj-ukrainu/32227264.html] — this is why Vienna has not been directly involved in providing military and technical assistance to Kyiv since the war began. Moreover, last spring Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer met[https://www.svoboda.org/a/kantsler-avstrii-putin-nastroen-na-to-chtoby-reshitj-vopros-donbassa/31798429.html] with Vladimir Putin in the suburbs of Moscow. Nehammer said the visit was not at all a friendly one, but nonetheless he became the first European leader to visit Russia after 24 February 2022.

The pressure of foreign regulators could actually force Raiffeisen to look for ways to exit Russia, notes Valeriy Zinchenko, senior partner of the PenPaper law firm. According to him, the possible amount of sanction-related difficulties, including fines, may exceed the potential profits of the group’s Russian branch.

In theory, if Raiffeisen continues to operate in Russia, the consequences for the bank could be grave — it might even lose its licence, political analyst Romanova notes. She recalls the case of France’s BNP Paribas, which in 2014 was fined[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-30/bnp-paribas-charged-in-sanctions-violation-probe-in-new-york?leadSource=uverify%252520wall] $8.9 bn for violating US sanctions against Cuba, Iran and Sudan. However, both she and other experts interviewed by Novaya-Europe doubt that there will be actual sanctions in the case of Raiffeisen Bank.

As Barkhota notes, the main argument in favour of RBI leaving Russia is the possible pressure on Raiffeisen’s branches in Central and Eastern Europe if the bank continues to operate as it is now. The bank would risk client outflow, reduced profits, and transaction restrictions.

Novaya-Europe sent a request to Raiffeisen Bank asking how the decision to leave the Russian market was made and what it cost. The bank refused to divulge this information.

Ways out 

Experts single out four scenarios of how things might develop for Raiffeisen in Russia:

The RBI will postpone its market exit for as long as possible and continue to operate; The RBI will sell its business in Russia; Russian assets will be withdrawn from the RBI; The bank will gradually reduce the number of services it provides in Russia, but its structure will remain as is.

Barkhota, who finds the first scenario the most plausible, notes that from a business point of view, it is not at all profitable for Raiffeisen’s shareholders to leave Russia because to them the Russian market is a “goose that lays golden eggs”.

Because Raiffeisen Bank has pretty much monopolised SWIFT transactions in Russia, Barkhota explains, it would have to sacrifice half of its profits if it leaves. The most pragmatic option, in his opinion, would be simply to endlessly update the plans for winding down operations until the crisis is finally over.

If the bank decides to sell its Russian assets, a domestic player is likely to be a buyer. Valery Zinchenko of PenPaper believes that, given the current legislation, it is the only option that could win the approval of the Russian leadership. In the case of Raiffeisen, one should expect both a full sale of assets to a major player (most likely, one of the big state banks), and an exchange of assets.

According to sources of Frank Media, in September of last year, RBI held negotiations with Russia’s VTB bank leadership on exchanging the assets of its subsidiary (VTB Bank Europe) for the Russian assets of Raiffeisen. However, it seems that the deal fell through. In March, Der Standard wrote that RBI might exchange its assets for those of Sberbank’s European subsidiary. Sberbank CEO Herman Gref later denied that such negotiations were taking place.

According to Barkhota, the main downside to exchanging assets is the inability to objectively evaluate the value of RBI assets in Russia and of a Russian bank abroad so that the deal would satisfy both parties.

There are several obstacles to the sale of assets, as well. Firstly, selling a bank means negotiating a special exception with the Russian authorities. 2,000 companies are currently on the waiting list for such permission from the Foreign Investment Commission of the Russian Ministry of Finance. The commission meets three times a month and considers no more than seven applications per meeting. At this rate, leaving the Russian market could take years on end.

Secondly, the sale will likely occur at a very large discount. Oleg Itskhoki, economics professor at UCLA, says that from the perspective of Raiffeisen’s shareholders the most important goal is to avoid selling the company “for one ruble”. The situation is exacerbated by Russian regulations. Foreign companies can now only exit a Russian business if at least 10% of the transaction, which must be conducted with a discount of 50% or more off the asset’s market worth, is paid into the Russian budget.

“Several largest financial organisations in Russia have enough money [to purchase Raiffeisen Bank],” Barkhota points out. “But there’s a catch: it is forbidden to sell assets to companies under sanctions. How do they get their money then?”

Barkhota finds it extremely unlikely that Russian assets will be withdrawn from the RBI. This scenario is similar to the deal that Alfa Bank’s founding fathers, Mikhail Fridman and Pyotr Aven, are trying to pull off. On paper, they want to sell[https://www.interfax.ru/business/890458] the bank to a business partner, Alfa co-founder Andrei Kosogov. Being an invested party, he is likely to act not as a shareholder but as a depositary who is only holding them until they can be sold profitably. Barkhota believes that while it is possible for the management of Raiffeisen’s Russian branch to act as such a depository while the bank is run remotely, this plan is too complicated to implement.

Oleg Vyugin suggests another scenario, which would circumvent all restrictions — very slowly winding up business in Russia. First, the bank stops granting loans, then it starts closing accounts — first to legal entities, then to individuals. „

“This is the path that Citigroup has been following for over a year now. In my view, it’s the most realistic option, because in other cases the risks are too high.

If you hand over the bank to its management, it will immediately fall under sanctions. The same will happen if a Russian oligarch buys the bank. And Raiffeisenbank will immediately become uninteresting [to clients] if it is under sanctions”, Vyugin notes.

Novaya-Europe sent an inquiry to Raiffeisen Bank to find out, among other things, which exit scenario the company is primarily considering. The bank declined to comment. A Raiffeisen International spokesman reiterated what the bank had already said in a statement [https://www.rbinternational.com/en/media/Press_Releases_2023/update-on-rbi-s-business-activity-in-russia.html]in late March.

Heading towards isolation 

Ivan Fedyakov describes the departure of Raiffeisen Bank and the closure of its correspondent accounts as a disaster: it is, in a sense, as close as possible to cutting Russia off from SWIFT. The fewer banks there are that can carry out cross-border transfers, the closer Russian citizens and businesses are to financial isolation.

As Oleg Vyugin explains, Raiffeisen remains one of the few banks in Russia that legal entities can use for cross-border transfers. Other major banks that have access to SWIFT include Gazprombank. The EU and the US have not imposed their toughest sanctions against it because Gazprombank services gas settlements, and these sanctions would effectively isolate it from the dollar and euro systems.

Similarly, international transfers were until recently available at Rosselkhozbank (RSHB) due to its servicing of the Ukrainian grain deal, even though it has been disconnected from SWIFT.

Raiffeisen’s market exit will make a big difference to firms that import goods into Russia: some are already preparing to change their patterns of procuring supplies from abroad.

“The European Commission has solved the SWIFT problem quite elegantly”, Fedyakov argues. “Officially blocking SWIFT for Russia would create a precedent that would be perceived very negatively in many other countries, because they will see that they could be treated the same way one day. In addition, SWIFT is an independent organisation, so the European Commission has no direct influence on it. But because so many foreign financial groups have left the Russian market, and several more will leave in the near future, cross-border SWIFT transfers will be out of the question for Russians. Payments will only be possible through third countries with which Russia has direct financial relations. This will be a disaster for the economy.”

Oleg Itskhoki is more relaxed in his assessment of Raiffeisen’s market exit. He thinks that one bank, connected to the international system and handling all transactions, would be enough to keep the economy intact.

Raiffeisen Bank did not respond to Novaya-Europe’s question about what will happen to the bank’s employees and clients after it leaves Russia. Zinchenko notes that if a foreign bank leaves the country by transferring assets to a large Russian bank, the transition for clients, especially individuals, will be the least painful. But analysts warn that the overall situation will still get worse: Raiffeisen has traditionally been used for cross-border deals. With its departure, these are likely to fade into oblivion. Without them, the subsidiary will hardly differ from other Russian banks.

In any case, we should not expect Raiffeisen to leave any time soon. The implementation of any of the scenarios for winding up business in Russia will take no less than a month. Especially since the bank’s own management is not particularly interested in leaving, and Raiffeisen’s home country Austria is not ready to force the bank into a complete break with Russia.

Finland's Neste has dropped plans to fit carbon capture equipment to its hydrogen production unit at Porvoo in favor of boosting its electrolytic ambitions at the site, the company told S&P Global Commodity Insights.

Under its SHARC project, supported last year by Eur88 million from the EU Innovation Fund, the company is looking at a hybrid blue and green hydrogen solution at its Porvoo refinery near Helsinki. Now Neste "has decided to focus on its green hydrogen project [at Porvoo] ... and discontinue its plans on carbon capture and storage," a spokesperson said in an email. This was because of the "remarkable increase in the production capacity" for green hydrogen at the site announced on May 3. SHARC originally included a 50-MW electrolyzer producing 8,000 mt/year of renewable hydrogen, plus a CCS plant capturing 300,000-400,000 mt/year of CO2 from the refinery's existing steam methane reforming unit.

On May 3, however, Neste said it would now develop a 120-MW electrolyzer plant, producing green hydrogen from 2026. "The electricity planned to be sourced [for the electrolyzer] will be renewable and it is targeted to meet the criteria for RFNBO [renewable fuels of non-biological origin] eligibility as stated in the EU Delegated Act proposals," the spokesperson said.

The Port of Rotterdam Authority is developing a site suitable for the construction of a green hydrogen plant with up to 1 GW electrolyzer capacity, it said. The project is linked to the tender for the 2-GW IJmuiden Ver Beta offshore wind farm later this year with Dutch authorities calling for bids to integrate wind into the energy system. Both the wind farm and hydrogen plant should be operational by 2028, it said. The electrolyzer producing 60,000 kg/day of renewable hydrogen will be built on the Tweede Maasvlakte with electricity coming from its HKN offshore wind farm starting this summer.

The Port Authority's ambition is to have 2.2 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030 with existing plans amounting to around 1.35 GW, it said.

The Netherlands plans a Eur300 million ($330 million) tender for hydrogen imports under the H2Global scheme, a spokesperson for the energy ministry told S&P Global Commodity Insights. The aim would be to open the tender at the end of this or the beginning of next year, pending parliamentary and state aid approval by the European Commission, the spokesperson said. Work on the design of the tender with decisions on hydrogen carrier, derivatives, volumes, import regions and pre-qualification criteria still need to be made, they said.

Vopak has opened 16 new tankers at its Vlaardingen terminal in Rotterdam to store sustainable feedstocks for fuel production in forecast of rising demand in Europe, the Dutch company said May 10. The tanks, with a combined capacity of 64,000 cu m, are designed to store waste-based feedstocks for producing biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel. Shell, which is building a new biorefinery in Rotterdam, has signed a long-term commercial agreement to store feedstocks at Vopak's Vlaardingen terminal.

The 82,000 mt/year biorefinery, one of the largest in Europe, will produce SAF and renewable diesel from waste materials such as used cooking oil, waste animal fat, and other residual products.

TotalEnergies is to build a 25 MW, 75 MWh (three-hour duration) battery storage asset at its Antwerp refinery in Belgium, the French company said May 15. The installation, to comprise 40 containers of lithium-ion batteries supplied by TotalEnergies' subsidiary Saft, is set to enter operation by the end of 2024. "After commissioning four battery parks in France offering total energy storage capacity of 130 MWh, this project will be the Company's largest battery installation in Europe," TotalEnergies said. The Antwerp battery would benefit from the refinery site's spare land and grid connection.

Finland's Neste will double capacity at its Singapore biofuels refinery to 2.6 million mt/year by end-2023, of which up to 1 million mt/year is sustainable aviation fuel, the company said at the opening of the expanded facility May 17. This followed the completion of the $1.74 billion Singapore refinery expansion project in mid-April, which includes an "enhanced" raw material pre-treatment capacity onsite to process "more challenging" waste and residue raw materials, Neste said in a statement. Feedstock such as used cooking oil are used to produce renewable diesel at Neste's refinery in Singapore, its website said.

Neste had also agreed to acquire a stake in Changi Airport Fuel Hydrant Installation Company -- the fuel storage and infrastructure join venture in Singapore's international airport -- so that it can offer blended SAF directly to airlines at Singapore's Changi Airport. The deal is subject to the fulfilment of customary closing conditions.

Hungarian oil and gas company MOL announced on LinkedIn May 10 that it has started commercial testing of SAF in cooperation with Budapest airport, Wizz Air, and Airport Fuel Services Ltd. In a statement May 10, Wizz Air announced that three flights had taken off from Budapest airport using a 37% blend of SAF produced by Finnish refiner Neste and supplied by MOL.

Multinational chemical company INEOS has developed an ultra-thin, rigid polyethylene film made of 50% recycled plastic for use in Europe's recyclable flexible packaging market, according to a May 2 company statement, a market where weak demand for recycled polyethylene persists. The material, developed in collaboration with engineers Hosakawa Alpine, compounds recycled plastic waste and new, highly engineered, resins to create a plastic film which "will be used to manufacture recyclable single polymer flexible packaging products that replace difficult-to-recycle multimaterial packaging products".

The companies will invest Eur103 million between them to produce the fuel, which can be used in any combustion engine for road, air and sea vehicles.

The plant will be the first at industrial scale to use CO2 and green hydrogen as feedstock to output 2,100 mt/year of fuel, equal to 18,000 barrels. The project includes a 10 MW electrolyzer, which will have Enagas and Ente Vasco de Energia as partners. Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for a planned 100 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

** Greece's Helleniq Energy said in May 2023 that the pilot investment in "green" hydrogen at the Elefsis refinery "edges closer to the final investment decision," while projects for the production of biofuels, such as HVO and SAF at its refineries, are "in the implementation phase."

** OMV Petrom said May 2023 that it has signed a financing contract through the National Plan for Recovery and Resilience for the production of green hydrogen at the Petrobrazi refinery in Romania. The project involves putting into operation a capacity of 20 MW for production of hydrogen by water electrolysis, which will be powered by renewable energy. It is estimated to produce over 2,600 mt/yr. The final investment decision is due to be made in 2024 with completion expected for 2025.

** Germany's Schwedt refinery will halt fossil fuel processing and be transformed into a "hydrogen hub" producing synthetic and bio fuels and other products by 2045, the refinery's management said at a press conference, according to local media reports. The refinery, which can currently produce around 11 million mt/year of oil products, would be able to make about 1 million mt/year of synthetic aviation fuels, 1 million mt/year of methanol and high-value chemical products, and 1 million mt/year of biodiesel, ethanol and biomethane, according to the reports. In order to produce synthetic hydrocarbons, the refinery will need 800,000 mt/year of green hydrogen from 2045. By 2027 it is expected to have electrolyzer capacity of 400 MW which would be able to produce 30,000 mt/year of hydrogen, with production reaching 160,000 mt/year in 2030 and increasing further to 240,000 mt/year, renewable energy services provider Enertrag, which is working on the feasibility study for the plant's transformation together with the refinery's management, said in a statement May 9.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Repsol said it was retrofitting the hydro units in all five Spanish refineries it operates to increase its use of bio feedstock as the business was starting to give positive impetus to its refining margins. Mild hydrocracker units at A Coruna, Bilbao and Puertollano as well as hydrocrackers at Cartagena and Tarragona will all be modified with no real capex impact, CEO Josu Jon Imaz said.

Separately, Repsol would take a final investment decision in H2 2023 on 350 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity spread across Cartagena, Tarragona and Bilbao, all of which are entering their engineering phase.

** The European Commission has approved a Eur158 million Polish green hydrogen support package for Poland's Gdansk refinery under state aid rules, it said in April 2023. PKN Orlen via its LOTOS Green H2 subsidiary plans a 100 MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen used in refinery processes as well as a 50 MW solar power plant and 20 MWh battery storage, it said. The electrolyzer is expected to start operating in 2027 and gradually increase production to 13,600 mt/year.

** Finnish refiner Neste said it has decided to "proceed to the basic engineering phase" of a 120 MW electrolyzer project at its Porvoo refinery aimed to produce green hydrogen. If an investment decision is made in 2024, production could start in 2026.

The green hydrogen would be used primarily in Porvoo to replace hydrogen produced from fossil fuel and will support the company's goal "to transform the Porvoo refinery to the most sustainable refinery in Europe by 2030," it said.

Finland's Neste has successfully concluded its second series of "industrial-scale processing runs with liquefied waste plastic" at the Porvoo refinery after carrying out the first processing run in 2020. The current processing uses the existing refinery equipment but ultimately Neste aims to establish large-scale capacities to process 400,000 mt/yr of liquefied waste plastic. From 2030 it wants to process more than 1 million mt/yr of waste plastic.

The aim is part of Neste's strategic study to transform Porvoo into "a renewable and circular solutions site and possibly end crude oil refining by the mid-2030s," it also said.

The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

** Finland's Neste said in its Q1 2023 financial report that the Rotterdam expansion project is "proceeding well". Its joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, started up its first phase in February. "Together, the growth projects are targeting to increase our total nameplate capacity of renewable products to 5.5 million tons by the end of 2023," Neste said. Neste reiterated that by increasing the SAF capabilities in Singapore and Rotterdam it is "targeting the optionality" to produce up to 1.5 million mt/year of SAF in 2024, which will reach 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026 when its nameplate capacity in renewable products is expected to increase to 6.8 million mt/year.

** BP plans to invest up to Eur2 billion in a green hydrogen plant at Spanish Castellon to replace the existing fossil-based hydrogen plant, it said in February 2023. Under the project, BP said it plans a phased development of up to 2 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030. The project will also see Castellon's production of biofuels triple to 650,000 mt/year by 2030 with the green hydrogen used as a feedstock in biofuel production, specifically of SAF. The first phase of the project will see the installation of an electrolysis plant with at least 200 MW capacity operational by 2027, with production of up to 31,200 mt/year of green hydrogen. In a second phase, to be completed in 2030, the electrolysis plant would be expanded to reach a capacity of up to 2 GW. BP has created a joint venture with Iberdrola covering Spain, Portugal and the UK to produce green ammonia and methanol as well as 600,000 mt/year of hydrogen. The refinery also has a target to triple sustainable jet fuel output to 15,000 b/d as part of its overall decarbonization program.

** Cepsa said March 8 it will build a new unit to produce second generation biofuel at the Huelva refinery with an investment of Eur1 billion ($1.1 billion). The plant will produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. The biofuels will be produced from organic waste, including used cooking oil and agricultural residues.

The plant will contribute to Cepsa's strategy to reach 2.5 million mt/year of biofuel production by 2030, making it a leader in the Iberian peninsula. The total will include 800,000 mt/year of SAF.

The refinery is also planning to start up 400 MW of hydrogen production capacity by 2026, having signed agreements in January and February 2023 with local partners.

Cepsa has already signed an agreement with the Port of Rotterdam to create the first green hydrogen corridor between southern and northern Europe, allowing the export of green ammonia and methanol.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a hydrotreated vegetable oils installation at Plock. PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery. The unit will process used rapeseed oil to produce an additive to diesel or aviation fuel. The annual production of the unit will be 300,000 mt of biodiesel or aviation biofuel. The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a bioethanol unit at the company's small Polish biofuels plant, Orlen Poludnie. PKN Orlen is also constructing a hydrogen plant at its Poludnie biorefinery in Trzebinia. Annual production will be 16 million cu m, and three-quarters of that will be used to produce glycol. The remainder will be used to produce 45 kg/h of fuel-grade hydrogen for use in transport.

** PKN Orlen said its subsidiary Orlen Poludnie has signed an agreement to build a "complex of units for production of II generation bioethanol" at its biofuel refinery in Jedlicze, southern Poland. The B2G complex will include a main unit for bioethanol production and will have the capacity to produce 25,000 mt/year of bioethanol from biomass. In the next stage, a biogas plant will be built. The biomass will be mainly cereals straw sourced from Polish farmers. The bioethanol complex will also include a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant, which will generate heat for bioethanol production. The Jedlicze refinery is a small former petroleum refinery, which together with the Trzebinia refinery, was incorporated into Orlen Poludnie, the company's biofuels subsidiary.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

In Oct. 2021, Gunvor said it had agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Phillips 66 is looking at carbon capture and storage as well as electrolytic green hydrogen production to decarbonize operations at its Humber refinery in the UK, Commercial Manager for Emerging Energy Mike Wailes said Feb. 2023. The initial focus is on post-combustion capture from the refining process, including from the crude topping unit, fluid catalytic cracker and hydro-desulfurization unit, with further more expensive options coming from refueling to use hydrogen, he said.

Phillips 66 is developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to be powered by offshore wind which can be scalable to 300 MW.

The Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways in early 2022.

Phillips 66 has said previously its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Portugal's Galp said it expects to sanction key projects in 2023, including 270,000 mt/year production of HVO capacity for producing advanced biodiesel and SAF, with a final investment decision expected in the year. In terms of green hydrogen, it also expects to take FID on a 100 MW Sines hydrogen production plant during 2023, targeting an eventual roll out of up to 700 MW to the end of the decade. The 100-MW Sines electrolyzer project will target to replace existing conventional hydrogen production. Previously, Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub.

** Spain's Repsol is to build a new 25,000 mt/year production line for recycled polyethylene at its Puertollano site. The new line, which will produce high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) with a recycled plastic content of 10%-80%, was expected to come into operation by the end of 2024. Current capacity for the plastics production at the site is 16,000 mt/year. Puertollano is also due to start a first polyurethane foam recovery plant this year at Puertollano while it also has plans to build a new unit to produce 15,000 mt/year of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) to come online in 2024 with an investment of Eur105 million.

** Renewable hydrogen company Everfuel has signed an agreement in Jan. 2023 to supply oxygen to an undisclosed company from its HySynergy electrolyzer in Fredericia, Denmark, enabling a higher utilization of the plant. The conditional agreement will improve the overall utilization and efficiency of the second phase of the electrolyzer, providing a long-term revenue stream, Everfuel said. HySynergy 2.0 will extend the existing 20 MW electrolyzer with 300 MW of additional capacity by 2025. It will be developed with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia and will produce hydrogen to decarbonize industrial processes and transportation. The first 20-MW phase started hydrogen production in December, with first commercial deliveries due in 2023. The plant, adjacent to the Fredericia oil refinery, will supply renewable hydrogen to the facility and for local zero-emissions transport, Everfuel said. The plant will send 80% of the hydrogen produced to the refinery for use as a feedstock in the refining process. The remaining 20% will go to hydrogen mobility applications. Phase two is to be built in three 100-MW stages.

** Piling work for a new biofuel plant being built by Shell at the site of Europe's biggest refinery, Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam (formerly Pernis), was due to be completed around summer 2023, with the new plant expected to start up in 2024 or 2025. Shell is building an 820,000 mt/year biofuel plant in Rotterdam to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste. The facility will not use virgin palm oil as a feedstock although it will process vegetable oils, such as rapeseed, to supplement the waste feedstocks "until even more sustainable advanced feedstocks are widely available," it said.

** Repsol along with Spanish companies Naturgy and Reganosa plan to construct a hydrogen electrolyzer at Meirama, close to the A Coruna plant, with the output used to feed the refinery. The first phase of the project will see 30 MW of installed capacity by 2025 at the site of a closed thermal power plant. A subsequent upgrade will take the project to 200 MW capacity, producing 30,000 mt of green hydrogen per year. A newly installed hydrotreatment unit at Spain's A Coruna that processes vegetable and cooking oils was expected to boost biofuel output by 5,500 mt/year in 2022, with the volume rising to 10,500 mt/year by 2024.

** Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery. The contract covers engineering, procurement and construction assistance for the conversion of Grandpuits "into a zero-crude platform oriented towards SAF," it said. Once in operation, the facility will have the capacity to produce 210,000 mt/year of SAF from sustainable feedstock such as used cooking oil and animal fat. Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in Q1 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform, starting in 2024.

Separately, Air Liquide is to invest over Eur130 million ($134 million) in a low-carbon hydrogen unit at the Grandpuits biorefinery. TotalEnergies has committed to buy the hydrogen under a long-term contract to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The new reforming unit, with capacity to produce over 20,000 mt/year of hydrogen, will partly recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, in place of the natural gas it normally uses.

TotalEnergies also said that its zero-crude project at Grandpuits "is based on the development of several future-oriented activities" which include chemical recycling of plastic waste, production of biosourced and biodegradable bioplastics, production of biofuels for the aviation sector, construction of a solar farm and electricity storage by batteries. The new units will be starting up from 2022 and are expected to be operational by 2025.

** Turkey's Tupras said it had completed basic engineering studies to produce sustainable aviation fuel at its Izmir refinery using Honeywell's UOP ecofining technology. Tupras said it plans eventually to produce 400,000 mt/year of SAF, renewable diesel and other products at Izmir.

In the future, it aims to increase the production capacities and produce sustainable fuels based on various waste feedstocks, such as used cooking oil. "Our goal is that, in 2030, to have an annual combined production of SAF and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil) of about 450 thousand tons," Radu Caprau, member of the Executive Board responsible for Refining & Marketing said.

** Repsol and partners Enerkem and Agbar have presented a project to transform 400,000 mt/year of urban waste to 220,000 mt/year methanol at Tarragona, which should start up in 2025 with an investment of Eur250 million. Spain's Tarragona has started on a series of energy transition projects, including the manufacture of biofuel for aviation and an advanced biofuels plant, which is already under construction. The refinery plans to build a 100-MW hydrogen electrolyzer by 2025.

** Hungarian oil and gas group MOL will build a 10-MW electrolyzer for renewable hydrogen production at its Danube refinery in Szazhalombatta, Hungary. The electrolyzers from US company Plug Power will produce 1,600 mt/year of green hydrogen, with operations starting in 2023.

** OMV said that together with AEG Fuels it will supply SAF from its Schwechat refinery on-demand for the "general aviation segment" to be used as an alternative to conventional jet fuel at the Vienna International Airport. SAF is produced at Schwechat by co-processing Austrian used cooking oil and is supplied via a direct pipeline connection to Vienna's international airport. OMV had also supplied the first batch of SAF to Vienna International Airport for fueling Austrian Airlines aircraft. Schwechat has received the two main components for producing SAF -- the reactor and column. From mid-2023 up to 160,000 mt of liquid biomass will be converted into SAF using an innovative co-processing method, it said. "The new reactor will process substances including vegetable oil together with other feedstocks in a procedure known as co-processing. This innovative process involves refining the biogenic feedstock via a hydrogenation process using hydrogen," OMV said. In the future, the process can be used for processing other feedstock such as used cooking oil or advanced bio-fuels. OMV plans to increase its SAF sales to more than 700,000 mt/year by 2030. Separately, OMV will build the country's largest electrolysis plant at the Schwechat refinery through a joint investment with Kommunalkredit Austria AG. The plant is expected to start in H2 2023. The 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis will produce up to 1,500 mt/year of green hydrogen.

** Germany's Bayernoil is looking at producing SAF from sewage sludge. It could convert 100,000 mt of sewage sludge into SAF annually under Project Bayosine. The processing, which involves pyrolisis, can be done in a new unit at the Vohburg site of the plant.

** Sweden's Preem aims to expand the HVO capacity at its Gothenburg plant from 320,000 cu m/year to 1.3 million cu m/year in 2026. "This is planned to take place in a completely new facility designed to produce renewable vehicle fuels and aviation fuels with great flexibility," it said. In its Lysekil plant, production of HVO from the Synsat plant "was the highest to date," the company said. Preem is rebuilding the existing Synsat plant, so it can produce renewable raw materials and replace part of the fossil production. It is expected to reach renewable production capacity of 950,000 cu m/year by 2024.

** Finland's UPM expects its Leuna biorefinery in Germany to be operational by the end of 2023 and ramp up in 2024. Construction of the facility, which will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals, started in 2020. Its total annual capacity will be 220,000 mt bio-monoethylene glycol and lignin-based renewable functional fillers. It will also produce monopropylene glycol and industrial sugars made from sustainably harvested beechwood sourced regionally in Germany.

** Greece's Motor Oil Hellas said its Corinth refinery by 2030 aims to enhance its pure hydrogen infrastructure through demonstration and scale-up of green hydrogen. In the long term, it aims to be a "large producer of clean hydrogen".

** France's TotalEnergies said it has "successfully started production" of SAF at its Gonfreville refinery in Normandy. The new site complements the biojet production capacities of the company's La Mede refinery and the Oudalle plant. All the biojet will be supplied to French airports and will be produced from waste and residue sourced from the circular economy. La Mede, in the south of France, and Oudalle, near Le Havre, began producing SAF in April 2021. La Mede stopped processing crude oil at the end of 2016 and was converted into a bio plant in 2019.

** Repsol's Cartagena has started construction of its planned second-generation biofuel plant at the nearby to the refinery Escombreras facility, which should result in the production of 250,000 mt/year of biodiesel from waste from mid-2023. The company will invest Eur200 million in the project that would output biodiesel, biojet, bionaphtha and biopropane, allowing an overall CO2 reduction of 900,000 mt/year. As part of its drive to decarbonize the refinery, Repsol also plans to build a 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer at Cartagena, with a target date of 2025.

** Orsted and BP are to jointly develop a 50 MW renewable hydrogen project at BP's Lingen refinery in Germany. The project, expected to be operational in 2024, would comprise a 50 MW electrolyzer capable of generating 9,000 mt/year of hydrogen, 20% of the refinery's current fossil-based hydrogen consumption. The electrolyzer is expected to be powered by an Orsted North Sea offshore wind farm. The partners have a longer-term ambition to build more than 500 MW of renewable hydrogen capacity at Lingen, providing renewable hydrogen to meet all the refinery's hydrogen demand and provide feedstock for future synthetic fuel production.

** Italian energy company Eni and SEA, the operator of Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, have signed an agreement to supply SAF for commercial flights, as a step towards accelerating the "ecological transition" of the two airports. Eni plans to develop Eni Biojet which will be made "exclusively" from used cooking oil or animal fats and can be "used in a blend with conventional jet fuel of up to 50%," Umberto Carrara, Director of Green/Traditional Refining and Market at Eni said. The company plans to produce around 200,000 mt/year by 2024 and double the production by 2030.

** BP has partnered with Dutch green hydrogen company HyCC to develop its 250-MW H2-Fifty electrolyzer project in Rotterdam. The companies will next select a technology partner for the previously announced renewable hydrogen project and begin environmental studies, with a final investment decision expected in 2023. The project is expected to come online in 2025. The renewable hydrogen produced at the facility will replace fossil-based feedstock at BP's Rotterdam refinery and other industries in the area. The plant will be situated in the Maasvlakte area of Rotterdam.

** Russia's Lukoil said in December 2021 that it has signed memorandum of intent with Rusatom Overseas, part of the Rosatom Group, to cooperate in the production and supply of green hydrogen for the company's Petrotel refinery in Ploesti, Romania.

** Varo Energy's Cressier refinery in Switzerland will use solar panel generated electricity by 19,000 photovoltaic panels for a "significant portion" of the electricity it consumes. Varo Energy Group and Groupe E will build the "most powerful ground-mounted solar facility in Switzerland" with an installed capacity of 7.7 MW. It will be built in the industrial zone east of the refinery. At full power the park will be able to supply more than 60% of the refinery's needs.

** ExxonMobil, Macquarie's Green Investment Group, and SGN are studying the potential for a low-carbon hydrogen hub centered around ExxonMobil's Fawley refinery on the UK's south coast. Initial hydrogen production could be around 4.3 TWh/year from 2030. Hydrogen demand in the Southampton industrial cluster around the refinery could reach 37 TWh by 2050.

** Italy's Saras is working on activating a green hydrogen plant for a total of 20 MW. Saras is building the green hydrogen plant with Italian utility Enel. The hydrogen produced would be used at the Sarroch refinery. It is currently provided by the IGCC complex and two reforming units on the industrial site.

** The Refhyne II consortium, developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for Shell's Rheinland refinery in Germany at its Wesseling site, has received a Eur32.4 million grant from the EU. The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies will stop using palm oil at La Mede from 2023. The biorefinery has already significantly reduced the amount of palm oil it processes from 500,000 mt/year initially to 100,000 mt/year in 2021. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen at Gdansk. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

Sustainable aviation fuel is in focus in Europe amid plans to ramp up supply and production.

Shell is to supply Qatar Airways with 3,000 mt of SAF at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, as part of a wider strategy to use 10% SAF by 2030 for its fuel needs. It is part of an existing contract with Shell at Schiphol, which will see Qatar Airways use at least 5% SAF blend over the contract period of the fiscal year 2023-2024, Qatar Airways said in a statement May 31.

The EU passed the ReFuelEU aviation initiative in April, which requires fuel suppliers to blend SAF in increasing amounts, from 2% of overall fuel supplied by 2025 up to 70% by 2050.

In 2021, SAF accounted for only 0.01% or aviation fuel demand in Europe, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights data.

Meanwhile, France's TotalEnergies said it is "stepping up" production of sustainable aviation fuel at the site of its former Grandpuits refinery to 285,000 mt/year, "more than double the capacity announced in 2020." Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in the first quarter of 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform.

** Greece's Motor Oil Hellas said in April 2023 that an investment in a new propylene splitter unit is "about to begin". The unit will have 100,000 mt annual capacity and is expected to be completed by 2026. It will use the existing infrastructure of the FCC unit which will switch part of the gasoline production into propylene.

** Croatia's Rijeka refinery completed planned activities during a shutdown and was starting up, it said in early May 2023. The refinery halted operations for five months between November 2022 and April 2023 while it continues with its upgrade project. During the shutdown, works will be carried out on "connecting existing units with new systems", the company said. It also clarified that "several suspensions" of operations are planned for the duration of the upgrade project, in which it is investing more than HRK4 billion ($524 million), as "the refinery cannot operate continuously while work is being carried out" on the existing and new units. The upgrade involves construction of a new residue complex, which includes a delayed coker. Works on the new residue complex started in 2020. Commissioning of the new complex is planned for 2024.

** UK-based Petrofac has secured a new EPC contract for the modernization and expansion of Orlen Lietuva's refinery in Lithuania, it said in April 2023.

"Petrofac's scope of work encompasses the design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of new facilities, as ORLEN Lietuva invests to expand the existing refinery complex," it said, adding that it has previously secured an EPC for the addition of a new residue hydrocracking unit at the refinery.

In October 2021, Petrofac was awarded another EPC contract to build a bottom of the barrel unit at the Mazeikiai refinery in Lithuania, due to be completed by the end of 2024. The construction started in August 2022. The new EPC includes the installation of a new amine regeneration unit and stabilization tower, interconnecting pipework and tie-ins to the existing refinery units, Petrofac said.

** Slovakia's Slovnaft has awarded an engineering, procurement services and construction management (EPSCM) contract for an off-gas upgrade at its Bratislava steam cracker to McDermott. The project will upgrade the existing steam cracker unit by adding a low-pressure recovery unit, increasing ethylene production capacity utilizing the off-gas from the existing production, McDermott said in a statement. Following the expansion, the capacity of the PP3 unit will increase by 33,000 mt/year to 300,000 mt/year. Construction was expected to start in the summer of 2023 and be completed in October 2024.

** Romania's Rompetrol said the cogeneration plant at the Petromidia refinery has reached "over 80%" general progress, including "around 95% progress on the engineering side, more than 96% on the procurement side and the actual construction is approaching 72%." The Kazakh-Romanian Energy Investment Fund (KREIF) "has made considerable progress in commissioning the cogeneration plant," the company said in March 2023. The project, which started in May 2021, will ensure the refinery's energy needs "exclusively from the cogeneration plant," it said. The new facility will generate approximately 80 MW of electricity. The KREIF is owned by KMG International, a subsidiary of Kazakhstan's state-owned KazMunaiGaz, and the Romanian state.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a visbreaking unit at Plock. The visbreaking unit refinery will have a capacity to produce 200,000 mt/year of diesel. Ongoing modernization of the hydrocracking and diesel hydrodesulfurization units at Plock will also increase the refinery's diesel production capacity.

PKN Orlen has bought a license and base design from US engineering company KBR for a potential bottom-of-the-barrel project. If PKN takes a final investment decision, it will construct a production complex using solvent de-asphalting and fluid catalytic cracking technologies.

Separately, PKN Orlen has signed a contract with Linde to build a new oxygen and nitrogen production unit at its Plock refinery. The unit will produce 38,500 cu m/hour of oxygen and 75,000 cu m/hour of nitrogen, supplying gas feedstock for the new Olefin III complex and other installations at Plock. The project is due to be completed by the start of 2025.

** Poland's PKN Orlen said it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil products loading terminal in Gdansk.

BIOFUEL, HYDROGEN UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** France's TotalEnergies said it is "stepping up" production of sustainable aviation fuel at the site of its former Grandpuits refinery in France to 285,000 mt/year, "more than double the capacity announced in 2020." TotalEnergies will also construct biomethane production unit at the zero-crude platform at Grandpuits, with annual capacity of 80 GWh, which will be supplied with organic waste from the biorefinery. The company said the bioplastic production project will not be pursued following the decision by its partner Cobrion.

Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in the first quarter of 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform,

Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery.

Separately, Air Liquide is to invest over Eur130 million ($134 million) in a low-carbon hydrogen unit at the Grandpuits biorefinery. TotalEnergies has committed to buy the hydrogen under a long-term contract to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The new reforming unit, with capacity to produce over 20,000 mt/year of hydrogen, will partly recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, in place of the natural gas it normally uses.

** BP's Castellon and Cepsa's Huelva refineries have been awarded around Eur15 million ($16.5 million) apiece from Spanish energy transition funds to build hydrogen electrolyzers. The project at Castellon is a 25 MW electrolyzer (named gH2 project), which will be developed together with Spain's Iberdrola at a total cost of around Eur43 million. BP previously said it plans to have 60 MW of electrolyzer capacity in operation at the site by 2025, 200 MW by 2027 and 2 GW by 2030.

BP also plans Castellon's production of biofuels triple to 650,000 mt/year by 2030 with the green hydrogen used as a feedstock in biofuel production, specifically of SAF. The refinery also has a target to triple sustainable jet fuel output to 15,000 b/d as part of its overall decarbonization program.

The project at Huelva is for 52.5 MW of electrolysis capacity in a project costing Eur59 million. During Q1 Cepsa announced agreements with fertilizer group Fertiberia and domestic gas and renewable groups Enagas and Alter Enersun to reach 400 MW of hydrogen capacity at Huelva by 2026. The company is seeking more partners to reach a target of 1 GW of capacity by 2030 under its Andalusia Hydrogen Valley project.

The company is expected to start work soon on a new Eur100-million dock at Huelva for its export operations of biofuels from 2026 and green hydrogen from 2027.

Cepsa has already signed an agreement with the Port of Rotterdam to create the first green hydrogen corridor between southern and northern Europe, allowing the export of green ammonia and methanol.

Cepsa said March 8 it will build a new unit to produce second generation biofuel at the Huelva refinery with an investment of Eur1 billion ($1.1 billion). The plant will produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. The biofuels will be produced from organic waste, including used cooking oil and agricultural residues.

The plant will contribute to Cepsa's strategy to reach 2.5 million mt/year of biofuel production by 2030, making it a leader in the Iberian peninsula. The total will include 800,000 mt/year of SAF.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Operator Petronor said May 6 that owner Repsol and Saudi Aramco have taken a final investment decision to construct a synthetic biofuel plant at Bilbao that will be completed in 2025. The project was previously targeted for 2024.

The companies will invest Eur103 million between them to produce the fuel, which can be used in any combustion engine for road, air and sea vehicles.

The plant will be the first at industrial scale to use CO2 and green hydrogen as feedstock to output 2,100 mt/year of fuel, equal to 18,000 barrels. The project includes a 10 MW electrolyzer, which will have Enagas and Ente Vasco de Energia as partners. Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for a planned 100 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

** Greece's Helleniq Energy said in May 2023 that the pilot investment in "green" hydrogen at the Elefsis refinery "edges closer to the final investment decision," while projects for the production of biofuels, such as HVO and SAF at its refineries, are "in the implementation phase."

** OMV Petrom said May 2023 that it has signed a financing contract through the National Plan for Recovery and Resilience for the production of green hydrogen at the Petrobrazi refinery in Romania. The project involves putting into operation a capacity of 20 MW for production of hydrogen by water electrolysis, which will be powered by renewable energy. It is estimated to produce over 2,600 mt/yr. The final investment decision is due to be made in 2024 with completion expected for 2025.

** Germany's Schwedt refinery will halt fossil fuel processing and be transformed into a "hydrogen hub" producing synthetic and bio fuels and other products by 2045, the refinery's management said at a press conference, according to local media reports. The refinery, which can currently produce around 11 million mt/year of oil products, would be able to make about 1 million mt/year of synthetic aviation fuels, 1 million mt/year of methanol and high-value chemical products, and 1 million mt/year of biodiesel, ethanol and biomethane, according to the reports. In order to produce synthetic hydrocarbons, the refinery will need 800,000 mt/year of green hydrogen from 2045. By 2027 it is expected to have electrolyzer capacity of 400 MW which would be able to produce 30,000 mt/year of hydrogen, with production reaching 160,000 mt/year in 2030 and increasing further to 240,000 mt/year, renewable energy services provider Enertrag, which is working on the feasibility study for the plant's transformation together with the refinery's management, said in a statement May 9.

** Repsol said it was retrofitting the hydro units in all five Spanish refineries it operates to increase its use of bio feedstock as the business was starting to give positive impetus to its refining margins. Mild hydrocracker units at A Coruna, Bilbao and Puertollano as well as hydrocrackers at Cartagena and Tarragona will all be modified with no real capex impact, CEO Josu Jon Imaz said.

Separately, Repsol would take a final investment decision in H2 2023 on 350 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity spread across Cartagena, Tarragona and Bilbao, all of which are entering their engineering phase.

** The European Commission has approved a Eur158 million Polish green hydrogen support package for Poland's Gdansk refinery under state aid rules, it said in April 2023. PKN Orlen via its LOTOS Green H2 subsidiary plans a 100 MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen used in refinery processes as well as a 50 MW solar power plant and 20 MWh battery storage, it said. The electrolyzer is expected to start operating in 2027 and gradually increase production to 13,600 mt/year.

** Finnish refiner Neste said it has decided to "proceed to the basic engineering phase" of a 120 MW electrolyzer project at its Porvoo refinery aimed to produce green hydrogen. If an investment decision is made in 2024, production could start in 2026.

The green hydrogen would be used primarily in Porvoo to replace hydrogen produced from fossil fuel and will support the company's goal "to transform the Porvoo refinery to the most sustainable refinery in Europe by 2030," it said.

Finland's Neste has successfully concluded its second series of "industrial-scale processing runs with liquefied waste plastic" at the Porvoo refinery after carrying out the first processing run in 2020. The current processing uses the existing refinery equipment but ultimately Neste aims to establish large-scale capacities to process 400,000 mt/yr of liquefied waste plastic. From 2030 it wants to process more than 1 million mt/yr of waste plastic.

The aim is part of Neste's strategic study to transform Porvoo into "a renewable and circular solutions site and possibly end crude oil refining by the mid-2030s," it also said.

The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

** Finland's Neste said in its Q1 2023 financial report that the Rotterdam expansion project is "proceeding well". Its joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, started up its first phase in February. "Together, the growth projects are targeting to increase our total nameplate capacity of renewable products to 5.5 million tons by the end of 2023," Neste said. Neste reiterated that by increasing the SAF capabilities in Singapore and Rotterdam it is "targeting the optionality" to produce up to 1.5 million mt/year of SAF in 2024, which will reach 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026 when its nameplate capacity in renewable products is expected to increase to 6.8 million mt/year.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a hydrotreated vegetable oils installation at Plock. PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery.

The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a bioethanol unit at the company's small Polish biofuels plant, Orlen Poludnie. PKN Orlen is also constructing a hydrogen plant at its Poludnie biorefinery in Trzebinia. Annual production will be 16 million cu m, and three-quarters of that will be used to produce glycol. The remainder will be used to produce 45 kg/h of fuel-grade hydrogen for use in transport.

** PKN Orlen said its subsidiary Orlen Poludnie has signed an agreement to build a "complex of units for production of II generation bioethanol" at its biofuel refinery in Jedlicze, southern Poland. The B2G complex will include a main unit for bioethanol production and will have the capacity to produce 25,000 mt/year of bioethanol from biomass. In the next stage, a biogas plant will be built. The biomass will be mainly cereals straw sourced from Polish farmers. The bioethanol complex will also include a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant, which will generate heat for bioethanol production. The Jedlicze refinery is a small former petroleum refinery, which together with the Trzebinia refinery, was incorporated into Orlen Poludnie, the company's biofuels subsidiary.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

In Oct. 2021, Gunvor said it had agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Phillips 66 is looking at carbon capture and storage as well as electrolytic green hydrogen production to decarbonize operations at its Humber refinery in the UK, Commercial Manager for Emerging Energy Mike Wailes said Feb. 2023. The initial focus is on post-combustion capture from the refining process, including from the crude topping unit, fluid catalytic cracker and hydro-desulfurization unit, with further more expensive options coming from refueling to use hydrogen, he said.

Phillips 66 is developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to be powered by offshore wind which can be scalable to 300 MW.

The Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways in early 2022.

Phillips 66 has said previously its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Portugal's Galp said it expects to sanction key projects in 2023, including 270,000 mt/year production of HVO capacity for producing advanced biodiesel and SAF, with a final investment decision expected in the year. In terms of green hydrogen, it also expects to take FID on a 100 MW Sines hydrogen production plant during 2023, targeting an eventual roll out of up to 700 MW to the end of the decade. The 100-MW Sines electrolyzer project will target to replace existing conventional hydrogen production. Previously, Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub.

** Spain's Repsol is to build a new 25,000 mt/year production line for recycled polyethylene at its Puertollano site.

The company plans to produce around 200,000 mt/year by 2024 and double the production by 2030.

** BP has partnered with Dutch green hydrogen company HyCC to develop its 250-MW H2-Fifty electrolyzer project in Rotterdam. The companies will next select a technology partner for the previously announced renewable hydrogen project and begin environmental studies, with a final investment decision expected in 2023. The project is expected to come online in 2025. The renewable hydrogen produced at the facility will replace fossil-based feedstock at BP's Rotterdam refinery and other industries in the area. The plant will be situated in the Maasvlakte area of Rotterdam.

** Russia's Lukoil said in December 2021 that it has signed memorandum of intent with Rusatom Overseas, part of the Rosatom Group, to cooperate in the production and supply of green hydrogen for the company's Petrotel refinery in Ploesti, Romania.

** Varo Energy's Cressier refinery in Switzerland will use solar panel generated electricity by 19,000 photovoltaic panels for a "significant portion" of the electricity it consumes. Varo Energy Group and Groupe E will build the "most powerful ground-mounted solar facility in Switzerland" with an installed capacity of 7.7 MW. It will be built in the industrial zone east of the refinery. At full power the park will be able to supply more than 60% of the refinery's needs.

** ExxonMobil, Macquarie's Green Investment Group, and SGN are studying the potential for a low-carbon hydrogen hub centered around ExxonMobil's Fawley refinery on the UK's south coast. Initial hydrogen production could be around 4.3 TWh/year from 2030. Hydrogen demand in the Southampton industrial cluster around the refinery could reach 37 TWh by 2050.

** Italy's Saras is working on activating a green hydrogen plant for a total of 20 MW. Saras is building the green hydrogen plant with Italian utility Enel. The hydrogen produced would be used at the Sarroch refinery. It is currently provided by the IGCC complex and two reforming units on the industrial site.

** The Refhyne II consortium, developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for Shell's Rheinland refinery in Germany at its Wesseling site, has received a Eur32.4 million grant from the EU. The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies will stop using palm oil at La Mede from 2023. The biorefinery has already significantly reduced the amount of palm oil it processes from 500,000 mt/year initially to 100,000 mt/year in 2021. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen at Gdansk. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

LAUNCHES

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Turkey's Ersan Petrol is still hopeful of its plans for a 1.4 million mt/year refinery at Kahramanmaras in southeast Turkey will be able to go ahead despite repeated delays and a difficult investment climate. Project coordinator Cenk Pala said Ersan was in talks with prospective partners and sources of finance for the project and hopes to start work on the FEED study this year. The refinery is planned for a 300,000 sq m site in Kahramanmaras which holds a defunct mini refinery that will be dismantled. A pre-feasibility study by Axens has defined the configuration and capacity of the plant which will produce mainly Euro 5 diesel, Euro 5 gasoline, jet and bitumen.

** A new greenfield Porto Romano refinery in Albania will be predominantly oriented to export markets but will also be able to cover Albania's domestic demand, Helmut Mayrhofer, consultant at Larkalis said. Austria-based consultancy Larkalis is leading an international consortium working on the project which will involve building the refinery in the port town of Durres. The refinery has a two-year construction authorization and could be commissioned by end-2025, depending on international developments.

** Azeri state oil company Socar is considering developing a second refinery in Turkey, in addition to its existing 214,000 b/d Star refinery at Aliaga on Turkey's central Aegean coast.

However, in his words, political relations with Austria are undergoing a "serious stress test."

"As is known, official Vienna not only joined the West’s destructive policy and supported all sanction packages, but also took an active part in their development. <…> The work of all bilateral; mechanisms and practically all contacts have been frozen by the Austrian side. Today, there is no subject matter for dialogue with Vienna," he stated.

According to Lyubinsky, the Austrian government "is ruining the constructive basis for bilateral relations, which has been built for decades, and is limiting the prospect for their normalization in the foreseeable future."

Mansion in Austrian Kitzbühel Bought by Sanctioned Russian Oligarch

英文
Copyright © Friedl Business Information GmbH
(Vindobona) Russian oligarch and confidant of President Vladimir Putin, Arkady Rotenberg, is said to have financed a house in Kitzbühel, where Putin's daughter is also said to have spent time, according to media reports.

According to internal documents cited by the Standard and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP),[https://www.occrp.org/en/rotenberg-files/documents-suggest-billionaire-oligarch-financed-purchase-of-austrian-chalet-used-by-putins-daughter] the money for the purchase of the villa was provided by a Cypriot company associated with Rotenberg.

Sanctions were already imposed on Putin's childhood friend by the EU and the U.S. in 2014. According to the report, the house in Kitzbühel belongs to the Cypriot company Wayblue Investments Limited, based in Nicosia. According to the research, the purchase was financed by a loan from Cyprus-based Olpon Investments, which Rotenberg has owned since 2003. Olpon transferred 11.5 million euros to the then Meridian Trade Bank in Latvia, which in turn was attributable to the Rotenbergs, reports suggest. The money went from there to Wayblue. It is unclear who owns the Wayblue company. According to the report, the shell company is controlled by another Cypriot shell company.

The shell company is controlled by another Cypriot company called Velidom Limited. This is a so-called trust service provider that manages assets for third parties. At the time of the real estate purchase, two other trust service providers were registered as owners of Wayblue, again the actual ownership cannot be found out.

As the Standard reported[https://www.derstandard.at/story/3000000175251/eine-oligarchenvilla-in-kitzbuehel-fuer-putins-tochter?ref=article], Neighbors, however, had indicated that Putin's daughter Maria Voronza was repeatedly seen in the house. This strengthens the suspicion that Arkady Rotenberg may have financed the purchase of the luxury property to do Vladimir Putin a favor - by making it available to his family.

The Austrian State Protection and Intelligence Directorate (DSN) has been unsuccessfully trying to determine the true owner of the property since April 2022. The city of Kitzbühel also appears clueless, although the Tyrolean opposition politician Markus Sint (List Fritz) has long demanded clarification. No one has been registered at the address since 2013, according to a letter from the city to Sint in the spring of last year.

Mayor Klaus Winkler (ÖVP) withdrew his promise to talk to the Standard [https://www.derstandard.at/story/3000000175251/eine-oligarchenvilla-in-kitzbuehel-fuer-putins-tochter?ref=article]. In writing, he merely let it be known in response to a long list of questions: "It is not known whether persons sanctioned by the EU have real estate assets in Kitzbühel." Nothing is known about the owners of Wayblue and no reference to the involvement of Russian persons can be found.

In any case, an Austrian real estate company sold the property in January 2013 for 10.8 million euros to the Cypriot company Wayblue Investments Limited. Since then, the chalet has belonged to this company, which has its headquarters in Nicosia. In Austria, Wayblue Investments is represented by Josef Wieser, a lawyer licensed to practice in Russia and specializing, among other things, in EU sanctions.

Childhood friends

The relationship between Putin and Rotenberg is an extremely close one. The two have been friends since their youth in St. Petersburg, when they trained in judo together. Since then, Putin has risen to become president, and Rotenberg has become the "king of state contracts."

Thanks to billion-dollar deals with the Russian state, Rotenberg became rich. His fortune is estimated at more than three billion euros. Probably the most important order: the construction of the prestigious bridge to the Crimea, which the oligarch built at Putin's request and was named a "Hero of Labor" for it. In the end, the project was the reason for the EU to sanction the oligarch.

Reactions on the part of Austrian political parties

Stephanie Krisper, the NEOS spokeswoman for internal affairs, lamented Austria's low level of involvement in the Russia sanctions. She said the case once again confirms that more extensive research and investigation would be possible if sufficiently qualified personnel were available. "The fact that the federal government has done nothing so far suggests that it has no increased interest in harming Russia," Krisper said, , according to ORF.[https://orf.at/stories/3320953/]

The Greens are asking big questions in light of the case. "It is incomprehensible to me why investigative journalists have to do the research work that should be the responsibility of state authorities - in this case, the Interior Ministry," said MP Nina Tomaselli, according to ORF.[https://orf.at/#/stories/3320953/]

MP Kai Jan Krainer (SPÖ) demanded, , according to ORF[https://orf.at/stories/3320953/], that "trustees must disclose the true beneficial owner in sanction matters". If this does not happen, the authorities should have a reasonable presumption that a sanctioned Russian is the owner, which should result in the freezing of assets.

Sustainable aviation fuel remained in focus in European refinery news amid ever-growing plans to ramp up supply and production across the continent.

French President Emmanuel Macron has announced the construction of a bio-refinery in Lacq in southwest France as part of a series of investments to decarbonize aviation, according to French media reports.

The start-up Elyse Energy will build the plant with partners Avril, Axens, Bionext et IFP Investissements. The plant will have a total capacity of 110,000 mt/year of biofuels including 75,000 mt/year of sustainable aviation fuel and 35,000 mt/year of bio-naphtha.

Speaking at Safran Aircraft Engines factory in Villaroche, France, on June 16, macron said: "We just secured total capacity of SAF production of 500,000 mt per year in France by 2030."

Separately, France's TotalEnergies said it was "stepping up" production of sustainable aviation fuel at the site of its former Grandpuits refinery in France to 285,000 mt/year, "more than double the capacity announced in 2020".

TotalEnergies also said it was "actively responding to a call from its aviation customers to increase production of sustainable aviation fuel" and from 2028 will produce 500,000 mt/year at its sites in France.

Elsewhere, Finland's Neste expects to produce up to 1.5 million mt/year of SAF in 2024, which will reach 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026.

Shell is to supply Qatar Airways with 3,000 mt of SAF at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, as part of a wider strategy to use 10% SAF by 2030 for its fuel needs.

It is part of an existing contract with Shell at Schiphol, which will see Qatar Airways use at least a 5% SAF blend over the contract period of fiscal year 2023-24, Qatar Airways said May 31.

The EU passed the ReFuelEU aviation initiative in April, which requires fuel suppliers to blend SAF in increasing amounts, from 2% of overall fuel supplied by 2025 up to 70% by 2050.

CONVENTIONAL UPGRADES

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Greece's Motor Oil Hellas said in April 2023 that an investment in a new propylene splitter unit is "about to begin". The unit will have 100,000 mt annual capacity and is expected to be completed by 2026. It will use the existing infrastructure of the FCC unit which will switch part of the gasoline production into propylene.

** Croatia's Rijeka refinery completed planned activities during a shutdown and was starting up, it said in early May 2023. The refinery halted operations for five months between November 2022 and April 2023 while it continues with its upgrade project. During the shutdown, works will be carried out on "connecting existing units with new systems", the company said. It also clarified that "several suspensions" of operations are planned for the duration of the upgrade project, in which it is investing more than HRK4 billion ($524 million), as "the refinery cannot operate continuously while work is being carried out" on the existing and new units. The upgrade involves construction of a new residue complex, which includes a delayed coker. Works on the new residue complex started in 2020. Commissioning of the new complex is planned for 2024.

** UK-based Petrofac has secured a new EPC contract for the modernization and expansion of Orlen Lietuva's refinery in Lithuania, it said in April 2023.

"Petrofac's scope of work encompasses the design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of new facilities, as ORLEN Lietuva invests to expand the existing refinery complex," it said, adding that it has previously secured an EPC for the addition of a new residue hydrocracking unit at the refinery.

In October 2021, Petrofac was awarded another EPC contract to build a bottom of the barrel unit at the Mazeikiai refinery in Lithuania, due to be completed by the end of 2024. The construction started in August 2022. The new EPC includes the installation of a new amine regeneration unit and stabilization tower, interconnecting pipework and tie-ins to the existing refinery units, Petrofac said.

** Slovakia's Slovnaft has awarded an engineering, procurement services and construction management (EPSCM) contract for an off-gas upgrade at its Bratislava steam cracker to McDermott. The project will upgrade the existing steam cracker unit by adding a low-pressure recovery unit, increasing ethylene production capacity utilizing the off-gas from the existing production, McDermott said in a statement. Following the expansion, the capacity of the PP3 unit will increase by 33,000 mt/year to 300,000 mt/year. Construction was expected to start in the summer of 2023 and be completed in October 2024.

** Romania's Rompetrol said the cogeneration plant at the Petromidia refinery has reached "over 80%" general progress, including "around 95% progress on the engineering side, more than 96% on the procurement side and the actual construction is approaching 72%." The Kazakh-Romanian Energy Investment Fund (KREIF) "has made considerable progress in commissioning the cogeneration plant," the company said in March 2023. The project, which started in May 2021, will ensure the refinery's energy needs "exclusively from the cogeneration plant," it said. The new facility will generate approximately 80 MW of electricity. The KREIF is owned by KMG International, a subsidiary of Kazakhstan's state-owned KazMunaiGaz, and the Romanian state.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a visbreaking unit at Plock. The visbreaking unit refinery will have a capacity to produce 200,000 mt/year of diesel. Ongoing modernization of the hydrocracking and diesel hydrodesulfurization units at Plock will also increase the refinery's diesel production capacity.

PKN Orlen has bought a license and base design from US engineering company KBR for a potential bottom-of-the-barrel project. If PKN takes a final investment decision, it will construct a production complex using solvent de-asphalting and fluid catalytic cracking technologies.

Separately, PKN Orlen has signed a contract with Linde to build a new oxygen and nitrogen production unit at its Plock refinery. The unit will produce 38,500 cu m/hour of oxygen and 75,000 cu m/hour of nitrogen, supplying gas feedstock for the new Olefin III complex and other installations at Plock. The project is due to be completed by the start of 2025.

** Poland's PKN Orlen said it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil product loading terminal in Gdansk. PKN said both investments are scheduled to be commissioned by mid-2025. The hydrocracking base oils project will help the company diversify into second- and third-generation base oils.

** The expansion of Orlen Unipetrol's steam cracker at Litvinov is still ongoing, the company said Dec. 2022. The company said in October 2021 it was contracting Technip Energies to build a new steam cracker furnace to be commissioned in 2022. The construction of an 11th furnace is set to boost production capacity to 585,000 mt/year of ethylene from 545,000 mt/year. The company plans to increase total petrochemical production capacity to 1.4 million mt/year by 2030 from 900,000 mt/year.

PKN Orlen has completed the Czech Koruna 9.6 billion ($410 million) polyethylene 3 unit investment at Litvinov. The refinery's owner, Unipetrol, a 100%-owned PKN subsidiary, has taken charge of the black polyethylene unit, the second part of the investment. The first part, the natural polyethylene unit, was completed in April 2020. The polyethylene 3 unit, which can produce 270,000 mt/year of high density polyethylene, will replace production of one of the two existing production units with a capacity of 120,000 mt/year. Litvinov's polyethylene capacity will increase from 320,000 mt/year to 470,000 mt/year. PKN Orlen was launching construction of a unit at Litvinov to produce up to 26,000 mt/year of dicyclopentadiene, or DCPC, used in the automotive, construction and electronic industries. Separately, McDermott International has been awarded a contract for engineering, procurement and construction management services for an upgrade of the hydrocracker at the Litvinov refinery.

** Israel's Haifa District Court has rejected an appeal by Haifa municipality along with six other neighboring communities and environmental groups against the proposed expansion of the Bazan refinery.

BIOFUEL, HYDROGEN UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** French President Emmanuel Macron has announced the construction of a bio-refinery in Lacq in southwest France as part of a series of investments to decarbonize aviation, according to French media reports. The start-up Elyse Energy will build the plant with partners Avril, Axens, Bionext et IFP Investissements. The plant will have a total capacity of 110,000 mt/year of biofuels including 75,000 mt/year of sustainable aviation fuel and 35,000 mt/year of bio-naphtha.

** France's TotalEnergies said it is "stepping up" production of sustainable aviation fuel at the site of its former Grandpuits refinery in France to 285,000 mt/year, "more than double the capacity announced in 2020." TotalEnergies will also construct biomethane production unit at the zero-crude platform at Grandpuits, with annual capacity of 80 GWh, which will be supplied with organic waste from the biorefinery.

The company said the bioplastic production project will not be pursued following the decision by its partner Cobrion.

Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in the first quarter of 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform.

Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery.

Separately, Air Liquide is to invest over Eur130 million in a low-carbon hydrogen unit at the Grandpuits biorefinery. TotalEnergies has committed to buy the hydrogen under a long-term contract to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The new reforming unit, with capacity to produce over 20,000 mt/year of hydrogen, will partly recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, in place of the natural gas it normally uses.

** France's TotalEnergies said it has signed an agreement with VNG, a German natural gas distribution company, to start green hydrogen supply to its Leuna refinery in Germany which will contribute to its decarbonization. The hydrogen will be produced from renewable electricity at a 30 MW electrolyzer operated by VNG with its partner Uniper. The pipeline connection with the electrolyzer in Bad Lauchstadt will "give the Leuna refinery access to the future European hydrogen infrastructure and the international markets for green hydrogen."

** France's TotalEnergies said June 19 it is "actively responding to a call from its aviation customers to increase production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)" and from 2028 will produce 500,000 mt/year of SAF at its sites in France. The volume, which will come from its Grandpuits, Gonfreville and La Mede plants, will be "enough to cover the gradual increase in the European SAF blending mandate, set at 6% for 2030."

Grandpuits will be able to produce 210,000 mt/year of SAF as of 2025 and further 75,000 mt/year by 2027. At the Gonfreville refinery in Normandy the company started coprocessing SAF from used cooking oil. It plans to increase annual production to 40,000 mt from 2025. It will also produce additional 150,000 mt/year by coprocessing HVO biodiesel produced at La Mede.

Biodiesel produced at the biorefinery La Mede is already used at the Oudalle plant near Le Havre to make SAF.

Meanwhile TotalEnergies is studying a new investment to have the capacity to process by 2024 at La Mede 100% waste from circular economy, such as used cooking oil and animal fat to produce biofuels and SAF by coprocessing.

La Mede stopped processing crude oil at the end of 2016 and was converted into a bio plant in 2019.

** Finland's Neste said in June 2023 it is ramping up production at its recently expanded Singapore renewables facility and expects to reach its design capacity in the coming months. The Singapore expansion, which started up in the second half of April, will bring the full design capacity of the site to 2.6 million mt/year, including up to 1 million mt/year SAF.

Its joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, which started up its first phase in February, is moving towards the second phase, which will bring a wider pool of feedstocks, Neste officials said during a Capital Markets Day June 20.

The plant will reach full capacity as the third phase is ramped up towards the end of 2023 and early 2024.

It has previously said Martinez' nameplate capacity is 2.1 million mt/year.

Neste has also decided to expand the Rotterdam facility and the construction is "well underway."

The expansion is set to add 1.3 million mt/year to a total of 2.7 million mt/year.

By increasing its SAF capabilities it expects to produce up to 1.5 million mt/year of SAF in 2024, which will reach 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026.

Neste's production capacity for renewable products is set to increase to 5.5 million mt/year at the beginning of 2024 due to the expansion at Singapore and the Martinez joint venture.

When completed, the Rotterdam expansion project will further increase the total capacity to 6.8 million mt/year by the end of 2026.

** Finland's Neste has made the final investment decision to build upgrading facilities for liquefied plastic waste at its Porvoo refinery, it said June 2023. The facility will have a capacity to upgrade 150,000 mt/year of liquefied plastic waste which can then be used as high-quality feedstock for new plastics. It is due to be finalized in the first half of 2025.

"We have developed our capability to process circular raw material at the Porvoo refinery over the recent years and are now set to build a respective facility," said Markku Korvenranta, Executive Vice President in Neste's Oil Products.

Neste started processing liquefied waste plastic at Porvoo in 2020 as trial runs. The company has said it aims to process more than 1 million mt/year of plastic waste from 2030.

Neste aims to make its Porvoo refinery the most sustainable in Europe by 2030 and possibly end crude refining by the mid-2030s. The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

Separately, Neste said it has decided to "proceed to the basic engineering phase" of a 120 MW electrolyzer project at Porvoo aimed to produce green hydrogen. If an investment decision is made in 2024, production could start in 2026. The green hydrogen would be used primarily in Porvoo to replace hydrogen produced from fossil fuel and will support the company's goal "to transform the Porvoo refinery to the most sustainable refinery in Europe by 2030," it said.

** Galp's Sines refinery has received a favorable environmental impact assessment from Portugal's Environment Agency (APA) for its proposed 100 MW green hydrogen electrolyzer and associated storage. The unit will be able to produce up to 14,000 mt/year of hydrogen, according to the specifications.

Construction was expected to take two years at a cost of Eur217 million. The company said in May it expected to take a final investment decision on the unit during 2023.

The hydrogen would be used principally for internal refinery use, but Galp's plans include a potential expansion to 600 MW, which it would integrate into a wider hydrogen project for the region, GreenH2Atlantic, which includes a separate 100 MW electrolyzer together with EDP as part of a conversion of the nearby halted coal plant.

Portugal's Galp has also said it expects to sanction key projects in 2023, including 270,000 mt/year production of HVO capacity for producing advanced biodiesel and SAF, with a final investment decision expected in the year. Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub.

** Cepsa has signed a partnership agreement to incorporate Norway's Yara Clean Ammonia in the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley in southern Spain. The company will be involved with a new green ammonia plant at San Roque, where it plans to invest Eur1 billion. The plant will be the largest in Europe, Cepsa said, with production capacity of 750,000 mt/year, which will prevent 3 million mt/year of CO2 emissions.

Under the agreement, Yara Clean Ammonia will supply Cepsa with green ammonia, allowing Cepsa to establish a green hydrogen corridor and serve industrial and maritime customers in Rotterdam and Central Europe. Cepsa has already signed a deal with Netherlands' Gasunie to gain access to its hydrogen network connecting Rotterdam to industrial clusters in Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.

The partnership is the first that Cepsa has announced for San Roque, where it has announced a target of reaching 1 GW of electrolyzer capacity by 2028.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** BP's Castellon and Cepsa's Huelva refineries have been awarded around Eur15 million apiece from Spanish energy transition funds to build hydrogen electrolyzers. The project at Castellon is a 25 MW electrolyzer (named gH2 project), which will be developed together with Spain's Iberdrola at a total cost of around Eur43 million. BP previously said it plans to have 60 MW of electrolyzer capacity in operation at the site by 2025, 200 MW by 2027 and 2 GW by 2030.

BP also plans Castellon's production of biofuels triple to 650,000 mt/year by 2030 with the green hydrogen used as a feedstock in biofuel production, specifically of SAF. The refinery also has a target to triple sustainable jet fuel output to 15,000 b/d as part of its overall decarbonization program.

The project at Huelva is for 52.5 MW of electrolysis capacity in a project costing Eur59 million. During Q1 Cepsa announced agreements with fertilizer group Fertiberia and domestic gas and renewable groups Enagas and Alter Enersun to reach 400 MW of hydrogen capacity at Huelva by 2026. The company is seeking more partners to reach a target of 1 GW of capacity by 2030 under its Andalusia Hydrogen Valley project.

The company is expected to start work soon on a new Eur100-million dock at Huelva for its export operations of biofuels from 2026 and green hydrogen from 2027.

Cepsa said March 2023 it will build a new unit to produce second generation biofuel at the Huelva refinery with an investment of Eur1 billion. The plant will produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. The biofuels will be produced from organic waste, including used cooking oil and agricultural residues.

The plant will contribute to Cepsa's strategy to reach 2.5 million mt/year of biofuel production by 2030, making it a leader in the Iberian peninsula. The total will include 800,000 mt/year of SAF.

** Operator Petronor said May 2023 that owner Repsol and Saudi Aramco have taken a final investment decision to construct a synthetic biofuel plant at Bilbao that will be completed in 2025. The project was previously targeted for 2024.

The companies will invest Eur103 million between them to produce the fuel, which can be used in any combustion engine for road, air and sea vehicles.

The plant will be the first at industrial scale to use CO2 and green hydrogen as feedstock to output 2,100 mt/year of fuel, equal to 18,000 barrels. The project includes a 10 MW electrolyzer, which will have Enagas and Ente Vasco de Energia as partners. Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for a planned 100 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

** Greece's Helleniq Energy said in May 2023 that the pilot investment in "green" hydrogen at the Elefsis refinery "edges closer to the final investment decision," while projects for the production of biofuels, such as HVO and SAF at its refineries, are "in the implementation phase."

** OMV Petrom said May 2023 that it has signed a financing contract through the National Plan for Recovery and Resilience for the production of green hydrogen at the Petrobrazi refinery in Romania. The project involves putting into operation a capacity of 20 MW for production of hydrogen by water electrolysis, which will be powered by renewable energy. It is estimated to produce over 2,600 mt/year. The final investment decision is due to be made in 2024 with completion expected for 2025.

** Germany's Schwedt refinery will halt fossil fuel processing and be transformed into a "hydrogen hub" producing synthetic and biofuels and other products by 2045, the refinery's management said at a press conference, according to local media reports. The refinery, which can currently produce around 11 million mt/year of oil products, would be able to make about 1 million mt/year of synthetic aviation fuels, 1 million mt/year of methanol and high-value chemical products, and 1 million mt/year of biodiesel, ethanol and biomethane, according to the reports. In order to produce synthetic hydrocarbons, the refinery will need 800,000 mt/year of green hydrogen from 2045. By 2027 it is expected to have electrolyzer capacity of 400 MW which would be able to produce 30,000 mt/year of hydrogen, with production reaching 160,000 mt/year in 2030 and increasing further to 240,000 mt/year, renewable energy services provider Enertrag, which is working on the feasibility study for the plant's transformation together with the refinery's management, said in a statement May 9.

** Repsol said it was retrofitting the hydro units in all five Spanish refineries it operates to increase its use of bio feedstock as the business was starting to give positive impetus to its refining margins. Mild hydrocracker units at A Coruna, Bilbao and Puertollano as well as hydrocrackers at Cartagena and Tarragona will all be modified with no real capex impact, CEO Josu Jon Imaz said.

Separately, Repsol would take a final investment decision in H2 2023 on 350 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity spread across Cartagena, Tarragona and Bilbao, all of which are entering their engineering phase.

** The European Commission has approved a Eur158 million Polish green hydrogen support package for Poland's Gdansk refinery under state aid rules, it said in April 2023. PKN Orlen via its LOTOS Green H2 subsidiary plans a 100 MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen used in refinery processes as well as a 50 MW solar power plant and 20 MWh battery storage, it said. The electrolyzer is expected to start operating in 2027 and gradually increase production to 13,600 mt/year.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a hydrotreated vegetable oils installation at Plock. PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery. The unit will process used rapeseed oil to produce an additive to diesel or aviation fuel. The annual production of the unit will be 300,000 mt of biodiesel or aviation biofuel. The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a bioethanol unit at the company's small Polish biofuels plant, Orlen Poludnie. PKN Orlen is also constructing a hydrogen plant at its Poludnie biorefinery in Trzebinia. Annual production will be 16 million cu m, and three-quarters of that will be used to produce glycol. The remainder will be used to produce 45 kg/h of fuel-grade hydrogen for use in transport.

** PKN Orlen said its subsidiary Orlen Poludnie has signed an agreement to build a "complex of units for production of II generation bioethanol" at its biofuel refinery in Jedlicze, southern Poland. The B2G complex will include a main unit for bioethanol production and will have the capacity to produce 25,000 mt/year of bioethanol from biomass. In the next stage, a biogas plant will be built. The biomass will be mainly cereals straw sourced from Polish farmers. The bioethanol complex will also include a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant, which will generate heat for bioethanol production. The Jedlicze refinery is a small former petroleum refinery, which together with the Trzebinia refinery, was incorporated into Orlen Poludnie, the company's biofuels subsidiary.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

In Oct. 2021, Gunvor said it had agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Phillips 66 is looking at carbon capture and storage as well as electrolytic green hydrogen production to decarbonize operations at its Humber refinery in the UK, Commercial Manager for Emerging Energy Mike Wailes said Feb. 2023. The initial focus is on post-combustion capture from the refining process, including from the crude topping unit, fluid catalytic cracker and hydro-desulfurization unit, with further more expensive options coming from refueling to use hydrogen, he said.

Phillips 66 is developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to be powered by offshore wind which can be scalable to 300 MW.

The Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways in early 2022.

Phillips 66 has said previously its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Spain's Repsol is to build a new 25,000 mt/year production line for recycled polyethylene at its Puertollano site. The new line, which will produce high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) with a recycled plastic content of 10%-80%, was expected to come into operation by the end of 2024. Current capacity for the plastics production at the site is 16,000 mt/year. Puertollano is also due to start a first polyurethane foam recovery plant this year at Puertollano while it also has plans to build a new unit to produce 15,000 mt/year of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) to come online in 2024 with an investment of Eur105 million.

** Renewable hydrogen company Everfuel has signed an agreement in Jan. 2023 to supply oxygen to an undisclosed company from its HySynergy electrolyzer in Fredericia, Denmark, enabling a higher utilization of the plant. The conditional agreement will improve the overall utilization and efficiency of the second phase of the electrolyzer, providing a long-term revenue stream, Everfuel said. HySynergy 2.0 will extend the existing 20 MW electrolyzer with 300 MW of additional capacity by 2025. It will be developed with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia and will produce hydrogen to decarbonize industrial processes and transportation. The first 20-MW phase started hydrogen production in December, with first commercial deliveries due in 2023. The plant, adjacent to the Fredericia oil refinery, will supply renewable hydrogen to the facility and for local zero-emissions transport, Everfuel said. The plant will send 80% of the hydrogen produced to the refinery for use as a feedstock in the refining process. The remaining 20% will go to hydrogen mobility applications. Phase two is to be built in three 100-MW stages.

** Piling work for a new biofuel plant being built by Shell at the site of Europe's biggest refinery, Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam (formerly Pernis), was due to be completed around summer 2023, with the new plant expected to start up in 2024 or 2025. Shell is building an 820,000 mt/year biofuel plant in Rotterdam to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste. The facility will not use virgin palm oil as a feedstock although it will process vegetable oils, such as rapeseed, to supplement the waste feedstocks "until even more sustainable advanced feedstocks are widely available," it said.

** Repsol along with Spanish companies Naturgy and Reganosa plan to construct a hydrogen electrolyzer at Meirama, close to the A Coruna plant, with the output used to feed the refinery. The first phase of the project will see 30 MW of installed capacity by 2025 at the site of a closed thermal power plant. A subsequent upgrade will take the project to 200 MW capacity, producing 30,000 mt of green hydrogen per year. A newly installed hydrotreatment unit at Spain's A Coruna that processes vegetable and cooking oils was expected to boost biofuel output by 5,500 mt/year in 2022, with the volume rising to 10,500 mt/year by 2024.

** Turkey's Tupras said it had completed basic engineering studies to produce sustainable aviation fuel at its Izmir refinery using Honeywell's UOP ecofining technology. Tupras said it plans eventually to produce 400,000 mt/year of SAF, renewable diesel and other products at Izmir.

** Croatia's INA is studying options for its Sisak refinery, including a biorefinery, biogas plant and production of pure hydrogen.

** Italy's Eni said it was "investigating the opportunity to build a new bio-refinery at Eni's industrial site in Livorno." It will be Eni's third biorefinery in Italy after converting its Gela and Venice refineries into biofuel plants. Eni said its feasibility study involves building "three new plants for the production of hydrogenated biofuel: a biogenic feedstock pre-treatment unit, a 500,000 mt/year Ecofining plant and a plant for the production of hydrogen from methane gas." The design of the three plants will be completed by 2023 and construction by 2025. Local officials welcomed the potential conversion of the Livorno refinery into a biorefinery as it would maintain "the current workforce and the entire production chain."

** Italy's Eni has started producing SAF at its Taranto refinery in southern Italy, as part of its commitment to decarbonize all its products and processes by 2050. Eni plans to increase its bio-refining capacity to 5 million-6 million mt/year by 2050. Eni targets its SAF capacity to reach at least 500,000 mt/year by 2030. Eni said its SAF production will continue to grow with the start-up of over 10,000 mt/year of SAF from its Livorno refinery using bio-components produced in Eni's existing Gela and Venice bio-refineries. In 2024, Eni plans to launch SAF production at the Gela bio-refinery, where a project is underway for a further 150,000 mt/year of SAF production from 100% renewable raw materials by 2025.

** Italy's Eni said that it will install a 20 MW electrolyzer at its Gela biorefinery and a 10 MW electrolyzer at its Taranto refinery. The electrolyzers will be part of a project to develop green hydrogen by Enel Green Power and Eni which will receive public funding approved by the European Commission.

** Ineos has awarded a design contract for a planned 190,000 mt/year low-carbon hydrogen production plant at its Grangemouth refining and petrochemical site in Scotland to engineering company Atkins. The plant is expected to be operational by 2030.

** Essar, the owner of the UK's Stanlow refinery, said it has received a hydrogen-powered furnace, which is the first in the UK. The furnace has been commissioned by Essar Oil UK "as it transitions to run its operations on hydrogen as part of HyNet, the UK's leading decarbonization cluster," it said. The furnace, which will run on 100% hydrogen fuel from 2026, "forms a central part of Essar's strategy at Stanlow to become the UK's first low-carbon refinery." The furnace will replace three gas-fired furnaces at the plant's crude distillation unit. Essar is also developing 300,000 cu m of biofuel storage capacity at the site, allowing customers to store, blend and distribute biofuels for the road, aviation and marine sectors. It will become the UK's largest biofuels storage facility when completed.

** OMV Petrom will start producing SAF at its Petrobrazi refinery, which will become the first refinery in Romania to produce the fuel. The refinery will produce SAF by coprocessing locally produced rapeseed oil. In the future, it aims to increase the production capacities and produce sustainable fuels based on various waste feedstocks, such as used cooking oil. "Our goal is that, in 2030, to have an annual combined production of SAF and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil) of about 450 thousand tons," Radu Caprau, member of the Executive Board responsible for Refining & Marketing said.

** Repsol and partners Enerkem and Agbar have presented a project to transform 400,000 mt/year of urban waste to 220,000 mt/year methanol at Tarragona, which should start up in 2025 with an investment of Eur250 million. Spain's Tarragona has started on a series of energy transition projects, including the manufacture of biofuel for aviation and an advanced biofuels plant, which is already under construction. The refinery plans to build a 100-MW hydrogen electrolyzer by 2025.

** Hungarian oil and gas group MOL will build a 10-MW electrolyzer for renewable hydrogen production at its Danube refinery in Szazhalombatta, Hungary. The electrolyzers from US company Plug Power will produce 1,600 mt/year of green hydrogen, with operations starting in 2023.

** OMV said that together with AEG Fuels it will supply SAF from its Schwechat refinery on-demand for the "general aviation segment" to be used as an alternative to conventional jet fuel at the Vienna International Airport. SAF is produced at Schwechat by co-processing Austrian used cooking oil and is supplied via a direct pipeline connection to Vienna's international airport. OMV had also supplied the first batch of SAF to Vienna International Airport for fueling Austrian Airlines aircraft. Schwechat has received the two main components for producing SAF -- the reactor and column. From mid-2023 up to 160,000 mt of liquid biomass will be converted into SAF using an innovative co-processing method, it said. "The new reactor will process substances including vegetable oil together with other feedstocks in a procedure known as co-processing. This innovative process involves refining the biogenic feedstock via a hydrogenation process using hydrogen," OMV said. In the future, the process can be used for processing other feedstock such as used cooking oil or advanced biofuels. OMV plans to increase its SAF sales to more than 700,000 mt/year by 2030. Separately, OMV will build the country's largest electrolysis plant at the Schwechat refinery through a joint investment with Kommunalkredit Austria AG. The plant is expected to start in H2 2023. The 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis will produce up to 1,500 mt/year of green hydrogen.

** Germany's Bayernoil is looking at producing SAF from sewage sludge. It could convert 100,000 mt of sewage sludge into SAF annually under Project Bayosine. The processing, which involves pyrolisis, can be done in a new unit at the Vohburg site of the plant.

** Sweden's Preem aims to expand the HVO capacity at its Gothenburg plant from 320,000 cu m/year to 1.3 million cu m/year in 2026. "This is planned to take place in a completely new facility designed to produce renewable vehicle fuels and aviation fuels with great flexibility," it said. In its Lysekil plant, production of HVO from the Synsat plant "was the highest to date," the company said. Preem is rebuilding the existing Synsat plant, so it can produce renewable raw materials and replace part of the fossil production. It is expected to reach renewable production capacity of 950,000 cu m/year by 2024.

** Finland's UPM expects its Leuna biorefinery in Germany to be operational by the end of 2023 and ramp up in 2024. Construction of the facility, which will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals, started in 2020. Its total annual capacity will be 220,000 mt bio-monoethylene glycol and lignin-based renewable functional fillers. It will also produce monopropylene glycol and industrial sugars made from sustainably harvested beechwood sourced regionally in Germany.

** Greece's Motor Oil Hellas said its Corinth refinery by 2030 aims to enhance its pure hydrogen infrastructure through demonstration and scale-up of green hydrogen. In the long term, it aims to be a "large producer of clean hydrogen".

** Repsol's Cartagena has started construction of its planned second-generation biofuel plant at the nearby to the refinery Escombreras facility, which should result in the production of 250,000 mt/year of biodiesel from waste from mid-2023. The company will invest Eur200 million in the project that would output biodiesel, biojet, bionaphtha and biopropane, allowing an overall CO2 reduction of 900,000 mt/year. As part of its drive to decarbonize the refinery, Repsol also plans to build a 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer at Cartagena, with a target date of 2025.

** Orsted and BP are to jointly develop a 50 MW renewable hydrogen project at BP's Lingen refinery in Germany. The project, expected to be operational in 2024, would comprise a 50 MW electrolyzer capable of generating 9,000 mt/year of hydrogen, 20% of the refinery's current fossil-based hydrogen consumption. The electrolyzer is expected to be powered by an Orsted North Sea offshore wind farm. The partners have a longer-term ambition to build more than 500 MW of renewable hydrogen capacity at Lingen, providing renewable hydrogen to meet all the refinery's hydrogen demand and provide feedstock for future synthetic fuel production.

** Italian energy company Eni and SEA, the operator of Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, have signed an agreement to supply SAF for commercial flights, as a step towards accelerating the "ecological transition" of the two airports. Eni plans to develop Eni Biojet which will be made "exclusively" from used cooking oil or animal fats and can be "used in a blend with conventional jet fuel of up to 50%," Umberto Carrara, Director of Green/Traditional Refining and Market at Eni said. The company plans to produce around 200,000 mt/year by 2024 and double the production by 2030.

** BP has partnered with Dutch green hydrogen company HyCC to develop its 250-MW H2-Fifty electrolyzer project in Rotterdam. The companies will next select a technology partner for the previously announced renewable hydrogen project and begin environmental studies, with a final investment decision expected in 2023. The project is expected to come online in 2025. The renewable hydrogen produced at the facility will replace fossil-based feedstock at BP's Rotterdam refinery and other industries in the area. The plant will be situated in the Maasvlakte area of Rotterdam.

** Russia's Lukoil said in December 2021 that it has signed memorandum of intent with Rusatom Overseas, part of the Rosatom Group, to cooperate in the production and supply of green hydrogen for the company's Petrotel refinery in Ploesti, Romania.

** Varo Energy's Cressier refinery in Switzerland will use solar panel generated electricity by 19,000 photovoltaic panels for a "significant portion" of the electricity it consumes. Varo Energy Group and Groupe E will build the "most powerful ground-mounted solar facility in Switzerland" with an installed capacity of 7.7 MW. It will be built in the industrial zone east of the refinery. At full power, the park will be able to supply more than 60% of the refinery's needs.

** ExxonMobil, Macquarie's Green Investment Group, and SGN are studying the potential for a low-carbon hydrogen hub centered around ExxonMobil's Fawley refinery on the UK's south coast. Initial hydrogen production could be around 4.3 TWh/year from 2030. Hydrogen demand in the Southampton industrial cluster around the refinery could reach 37 TWh by 2050.

** Italy's Saras is working on activating a green hydrogen plant for a total of 20 MW. Saras is building the green hydrogen plant with Italian utility Enel. The hydrogen produced would be used at the Sarroch refinery. It is currently provided by the IGCC complex and two reforming units on the industrial site.

** The Refhyne II consortium, developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for Shell's Rheinland refinery in Germany at its Wesseling site, has received a Eur32.4 million grant from the EU. The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen at Gdansk. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

LAUNCHES

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Turkey's Ersan Petrol is still hopeful of its plans for a 1.4 million mt/year refinery at Kahramanmaras in southeast Turkey will be able to go ahead despite repeated delays and a difficult investment climate. Project coordinator Cenk Pala said Ersan was in talks with prospective partners and sources of finance for the project and hopes to start work on the FEED study this year. The refinery is planned for a 300,000 sq m site in Kahramanmaras which holds a defunct mini refinery that will be dismantled. A pre-feasibility study by Axens has defined the configuration and capacity of the plant which will produce mainly Euro 5 diesel, Euro 5 gasoline, jet and bitumen.

** A new greenfield Porto Romano refinery in Albania will be oriented to export markets but will also be able to cover Albania's domestic demand, Helmut Mayrhofer, consultant at Larkalis said. Austria-based consultancy Larkalis is leading an international consortium working on the project which will involve building the refinery in the port town of Durres. The refinery has a two-year construction authorization and could be commissioned by end-2025, depending on international developments.

** Azeri state oil company Socar is considering developing a second refinery in Turkey, in addition to its existing 214,000 b/d Star refinery at Aliaga on Turkey's central Aegean coast.

A number of companies have recently announced plastic recycling projects.

ExxonMobil has appointed engineering firm Kent as its front end engineering design contractor, to expand advanced plastic recycling capacity across seven sites. Kent will provide FEED services for ExxonMobil's advanced recycling facilities in Baytown, Texas; Beaumont, Texas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Joliet, Illinois; Sarnia, Canada; Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and Antwerp, Belgium, Kent said in a statement June 27. The roll-out of recycling capacity follows successful trials at ExxonMobil's facility at Baytown, where Kent designed the plastics recycling program.

Meanwhile, petrochemicals producer Ineos aims to incorporate at least 850,000 mt of recycled and bio-attributed material in its polymers by 2030, the company said June 29 in a sustainability report. The fresh target comes on top of existing ones, including offering polyolefin products for packaging with at least 50% recycled content by 2025 and using 30% recycled content on average in polystyrene packaging in Europe by 2025, but comes amid headwinds in plastic recycling. While the announcement aligns with increasing momentum among companies to beef up their environmental credentials, petrochemicals market sources are expecting weak recycled polymer demand to persist through the second half of 2023 following an unexpectedly underwhelming start to the summer buying season.

Separately, Ineos Group has announced a potential reorganization of its aromatics production operations at its Doel site near Antwerp, Belgium, citing "difficult market conditions" and a need to strengthen the competitiveness of its phenol business. The Doel facility is the world's largest phenol production plant, with a nameplate capacity of 680,000 mt/year, according to Ineos. The plant produces phenol, acetone and alpha-methylstyrene (AMS), using feedstock cumene. Production operations at Doel were not restarted following the completion of a maintenance turnaround at the plant in the fall of 2022, Ineos said. "A combination of unprecedented energy prices, high inflation and a cyclical slowdown have considerably weakened industrial demand for chemical products. End-users of phenol and acetone have substantially reduced their production. Customers are also facing increased competition and imports from suppliers from Asia," it said in a statement June 29.

In other news, the UK should introduce a carbon border tax to boost the country's competitiveness in the energy transition and to reduce risk of carbon leakage, amid headwinds for refiners in the region, the UK Petroleum Industry Association said June 30. The UK has higher carbon and energy costs than most competitor countries, poorer incentives to develop low carbon technologies, and a policy environment that does not offer enough investor certainty, the UKPIA said June 30.

"A well-designed carbon levy in the form of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), is needed to ensure importers have equivalent costs for carbon emissions as UK manufacturers have to face," it said.

In addition, the UK government should match the financial support offered to decarbonization projects in the EU, US and other competitor jurisdictions, the UKPIA said. "The UK's refiners are vital to the UK's plans to meet net zero by producing the low carbon liquid fuels, hydrogen and industrial carbon capture the country needs," UKPIA CEO Elizabeth de Jong said in its statement. "But to invest at the scale required, they need a level playing field with countries with less stringent environmental standards or who have more financial support."

In October 2021, Petrofac was awarded another EPC contract to build a bottom of the barrel unit at the Mazeikiai refinery in Lithuania, due to be completed by the end of 2024. The construction started in August 2022. The new EPC includes the installation of a new amine regeneration unit and stabilization tower, interconnecting pipework and tie-ins to the existing refinery units, Petrofac said.

** Slovakia's Slovnaft has awarded an engineering, procurement services and construction management (EPSCM) contract for an off-gas upgrade at its Bratislava steam cracker to McDermott. The project will upgrade the existing steam cracker unit by adding a low-pressure recovery unit, increasing ethylene production capacity utilizing the off-gas from the existing production, McDermott said in a statement. Following the expansion, the capacity of the PP3 unit will increase by 33,000 mt/year to 300,000 mt/year. Construction was expected to start in the summer of 2023 and be completed in October 2024.

** Romania's Rompetrol said the cogeneration plant at the Petromidia refinery has reached "over 80%" general progress, including "around 95% progress on the engineering side, more than 96% on the procurement side and the actual construction is approaching 72%." The Kazakh-Romanian Energy Investment Fund (KREIF) "has made considerable progress in commissioning the cogeneration plant," the company said in March 2023. The project, which started in May 2021, will ensure the refinery's energy needs "exclusively from the cogeneration plant," it said. The new facility will generate approximately 80 MW of electricity. The KREIF is owned by KMG International, a subsidiary of Kazakhstan's state-owned KazMunaiGaz, and the Romanian state.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a visbreaking unit at Plock. The visbreaking unit refinery will have a capacity to produce 200,000 mt/year of diesel. Ongoing modernization of the hydrocracking and diesel hydrodesulfurization units at Plock will also increase the refinery's diesel production capacity.

PKN Orlen has bought a license and base design from US engineering company KBR for a potential bottom-of-the-barrel project. If PKN takes a final investment decision, it will construct a production complex using solvent de-asphalting and fluid catalytic cracking technologies.

Separately, PKN Orlen has signed a contract with Linde to build a new oxygen and nitrogen production unit at its Plock refinery. The unit will produce 38,500 cu m/hour of oxygen and 75,000 cu m/hour of nitrogen, supplying gas feedstock for the new Olefin III complex and other installations at Plock. The project is due to be completed by the start of 2025.

** Poland's PKN Orlen said it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil product loading terminal in Gdansk. PKN said both investments are scheduled to be commissioned by mid-2025. The hydrocracking base oils project will help the company diversify into second- and third-generation base oils.

** The expansion of Orlen Unipetrol's steam cracker at Litvinov is still ongoing, the company said Dec. 2022. The company said in October 2021 it was contracting Technip Energies to build a new steam cracker furnace to be commissioned in 2022. The construction of an 11th furnace is set to boost production capacity to 585,000 mt/year of ethylene from 545,000 mt/year. The company plans to increase total petrochemical production capacity to 1.4 million mt/year by 2030 from 900,000 mt/year.

PKN Orlen has completed the Czech Koruna 9.6 billion ($410 million) polyethylene 3 unit investment at Litvinov. The refinery's owner, Unipetrol, a 100%-owned PKN subsidiary, has taken charge of the black polyethylene unit, the second part of the investment. The first part, the natural polyethylene unit, was completed in April 2020. The polyethylene 3 unit, which can produce 270,000 mt/year of high density polyethylene, will replace production of one of the two existing production units with a capacity of 120,000 mt/year. Litvinov's polyethylene capacity will increase from 320,000 mt/year to 470,000 mt/year. PKN Orlen was launching construction of a unit at Litvinov to produce up to 26,000 mt/year of dicyclopentadiene, or DCPC, used in the automotive, construction and electronic industries. Separately, McDermott International has been awarded a contract for engineering, procurement and construction management services for an upgrade of the hydrocracker at the Litvinov refinery.

BIOFUEL, HYDROGEN UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** France's TotalEnergies said June 28 that it will invest Eur70 million in its La Mede biorefinery during its first big maintenance in 2024. The aim of the investment is to enable the refinery to process more used cooking oil and animal fat into biofuels. Since 2019, La Mede has been capable of producing 500,000 mt/year of renewable diesel. The investment is part of the company's objective to achieve 75% waste from circular economy as well as the acceleration of production of sustainable aviation fuel.

** Italy's Sarpom refinery has inaugurated the start of production of advanced biofuel will be produced from second-generation biomass, local media reported.

** France's TotalEnergies said in late June it was inaugurating a solar power plant at its former Grandpuits refinery as well as a battery energy storage park. The two projects are part of its strategy to transform Grandpuits into a multi-energy and zero crude platform. The solar plant generates 31 GWh of green electricity annually. The storage system has 43 MWh capacity.

TotalEnergies said it is "stepping up" production of sustainable aviation fuel at the site of its former Grandpuits refinery in France to 285,000 mt/year, "more than double the capacity announced in 2020." TotalEnergies will also construct biomethane production unit at the zero-crude platform at Grandpuits, with annual capacity of 80 GWh, which will be supplied with organic waste from the biorefinery.

The company said the bioplastic production project will not be pursued following the decision by its partner Cobrion.

Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in the first quarter of 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform.

Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery.

Separately, Air Liquide is to invest over Eur130 million in a low-carbon hydrogen unit at the Grandpuits biorefinery. TotalEnergies has committed to buy the hydrogen under a long-term contract to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The new reforming unit, with capacity to produce over 20,000 mt/year of hydrogen, will partly recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, in place of the natural gas it normally uses.

** Spain's Repsol plans to commission the country's largest hydrogen electrolyzer at its Tarragona refinery in 2026 after the project was granted European financing from the Innovation Fund program, the company said July 2023.

The 150-MW project is part of the Hydrogen Valley of Catalonia and the Ebro Hydrogen Corridor and is included in the Repsol-led SHYNE consortium. Repsol leads the consortium which counts Enagas Renovable, Iqoxe and Messer as partners.

Following the first phase of the project, a second phase starting from 2027 could boost renewable hydrogen production capacity to 1 GW, Repsol said.

Repsol has previously said it would take a final investment decision in H2 2023 on 350 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity spread across Cartagena, Tarragona and Bilbao, all of which are entering their engineering phase.

** Lummus Technology said June 2023 that it has agreed with Hungary's MOL Group to cooperate in "the deployment and integration of chemical recycling of plastics at MOL's assets in Hungary and Slovakia." "Chemical recycling of plastics is part of MOL's commitment to collect close to 5 million tonnes of municipal solid waste, which includes the treatment and related investments," the companies said in a statement.

Lummus will provide MOL "its advanced waste plastic pyrolysis technology, which effectively converts plastic waste into high-value chemicals and feedstocks, creating circularity," the statement said, adding that MOL plans to build a production portfolio of over 100,000 mt/yr recycled plastic materials.

Separately, MOL will build a 10-MW electrolyzer for renewable hydrogen production at its Danube refinery in Szazhalombatta, Hungary. The electrolyzers from US company Plug Power will produce 1,600 mt/year of green hydrogen, with operations starting in 2023.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** French President Emmanuel Macron has announced the construction of a bio-refinery in Lacq in southwest France as part of a series of investments to decarbonize aviation, according to French media reports. The start-up Elyse Energy will build the plant with partners Avril, Axens, Bionext et IFP Investissements. The plant will have a total capacity of 110,000 mt/year of biofuels including 75,000 mt/year of sustainable aviation fuel and 35,000 mt/year of bio-naphtha.

** France's TotalEnergies said it has signed an agreement with VNG, a German natural gas distribution company, to start green hydrogen supply to its Leuna refinery in Germany which will contribute to its decarbonization. The hydrogen will be produced from renewable electricity at a 30 MW electrolyzer operated by VNG with its partner Uniper. The pipeline connection with the electrolyzer in Bad Lauchstadt will "give the Leuna refinery access to the future European hydrogen infrastructure and the international markets for green hydrogen."

** France's TotalEnergies said June 2023 it is "actively responding to a call from its aviation customers to increase production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)" and from 2028 will produce 500,000 mt/year of SAF at its sites in France. The volume, which will come from its Grandpuits, Gonfreville and La Mede plants, will be "enough to cover the gradual increase in the European SAF blending mandate, set at 6% for 2030."

Grandpuits will be able to produce 210,000 mt/year of SAF as of 2025 and further 75,000 mt/year by 2027. At the Gonfreville refinery in Normandy the company started coprocessing SAF from used cooking oil. It plans to increase annual production to 40,000 mt from 2025. It will also produce additional 150,000 mt/year by coprocessing HVO biodiesel produced at La Mede.

Biodiesel produced at the biorefinery La Mede is already used at the Oudalle plant near Le Havre to make SAF.

Meanwhile TotalEnergies is studying a new investment to have the capacity to process by 2024 at La Mede 100% waste from circular economy, such as used cooking oil and animal fat to produce biofuels and SAF by coprocessing.

La Mede stopped processing crude oil at the end of 2016 and was converted into a bio plant in 2019.

** Finland's Neste said in June 2023 it is ramping up production at its recently expanded Singapore renewables facility and expects to reach its design capacity in the coming months. The Singapore expansion, which started up in the second half of April, will bring the full design capacity of the site to 2.6 million mt/year, including up to 1 million mt/year SAF.

Its joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, which started up its first phase in February, is moving towards the second phase, which will bring a wider pool of feedstocks, Neste officials said during a Capital Markets Day June 20.

The plant will reach full capacity as the third phase is ramped up towards the end of 2023 and early 2024.

It has previously said Martinez' nameplate capacity is 2.1 million mt/year.

Neste has also decided to expand the Rotterdam facility and the construction is "well underway."

The expansion is set to add 1.3 million mt/year to a total of 2.7 million mt/year.

By increasing its SAF capabilities it expects to produce up to 1.5 million mt/year of SAF in 2024, which will reach 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026.

Neste's production capacity for renewable products is set to increase to 5.5 million mt/year at the beginning of 2024 due to the expansion at Singapore and the Martinez joint venture.

When completed, the Rotterdam expansion project will further increase the total capacity to 6.8 million mt/year by the end of 2026.

** Finland's Neste has made the final investment decision to build upgrading facilities for liquefied plastic waste at its Porvoo refinery, it said June 2023. The facility will have a capacity to upgrade 150,000 mt/year of liquefied plastic waste which can then be used as high-quality feedstock for new plastics. It is due to be finalized in the first half of 2025.

"We have developed our capability to process circular raw material at the Porvoo refinery over the recent years and are now set to build a respective facility," said Markku Korvenranta, Executive Vice President in Neste's Oil Products.

Neste started processing liquefied waste plastic at Porvoo in 2020 as trial runs. The company has said it aims to process more than 1 million mt/year of plastic waste from 2030.

Neste aims to make its Porvoo refinery the most sustainable in Europe by 2030 and possibly end crude refining by the mid-2030s. The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

Separately, Neste said it has decided to "proceed to the basic engineering phase" of a 120 MW electrolyzer project at Porvoo aimed to produce green hydrogen. If an investment decision is made in 2024, production could start in 2026. The green hydrogen would be used primarily in Porvoo to replace hydrogen produced from fossil fuel and will support the company's goal "to transform the Porvoo refinery to the most sustainable refinery in Europe by 2030," it said.

** Galp's Sines refinery has received a favorable environmental impact assessment from Portugal's Environment Agency (APA) for its proposed 100 MW green hydrogen electrolyzer and associated storage. The unit will be able to produce up to 14,000 mt/year of hydrogen, according to the specifications.

Construction was expected to take two years at a cost of Eur217 million. The company said in May it expected to take a final investment decision on the unit during 2023.

The hydrogen would be used principally for internal refinery use, but Galp's plans include a potential expansion to 600 MW, which it would integrate into a wider hydrogen project for the region, GreenH2Atlantic, which includes a separate 100 MW electrolyzer together with EDP as part of a conversion of the nearby halted coal plant.

Portugal's Galp has also said it expects to sanction key projects in 2023, including 270,000 mt/year production of HVO capacity for producing advanced biodiesel and SAF, with a final investment decision expected in the year. Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub.

** Cepsa has signed a partnership agreement to incorporate Norway's Yara Clean Ammonia in the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley in southern Spain. The company will be involved with a new green ammonia plant at San Roque, where it plans to invest Eur1 billion. The plant will be the largest in Europe, Cepsa said, with production capacity of 750,000 mt/year, which will prevent 3 million mt/year of CO2 emissions.

Under the agreement, Yara Clean Ammonia will supply Cepsa with green ammonia, allowing Cepsa to establish a green hydrogen corridor and serve industrial and maritime customers in Rotterdam and Central Europe. Cepsa has already signed a deal with Netherlands' Gasunie to gain access to its hydrogen network connecting Rotterdam to industrial clusters in Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.

The partnership is the first that Cepsa has announced for San Roque, where it has announced a target of reaching 1 GW of electrolyzer capacity by 2028.

** BP's Castellon and Cepsa's Huelva refineries have been awarded around Eur15 million apiece from Spanish energy transition funds to build hydrogen electrolyzers. The project at Castellon is a 25 MW electrolyzer (named gH2 project), which will be developed together with Spain's Iberdrola at a total cost of around Eur43 million. BP previously said it plans to have 60 MW of electrolyzer capacity in operation at the site by 2025, 200 MW by 2027 and 2 GW by 2030.

BP also plans Castellon's production of biofuels triple to 650,000 mt/year by 2030 with the green hydrogen used as a feedstock in biofuel production, specifically of SAF. The refinery also has a target to triple sustainable jet fuel output to 15,000 b/d as part of its overall decarbonization program.

The project at Huelva is for 52.5 MW of electrolysis capacity in a project costing Eur59 million. During Q1 Cepsa announced agreements with fertilizer group Fertiberia and domestic gas and renewable groups Enagas and Alter Enersun to reach 400 MW of hydrogen capacity at Huelva by 2026. The company is seeking more partners to reach a target of 1 GW of capacity by 2030 under its Andalusia Hydrogen Valley project.

The company is expected to start work soon on a new Eur100-million dock at Huelva for its export operations of biofuels from 2026 and green hydrogen from 2027.

Cepsa said March 2023 it will build a new unit to produce second generation biofuel at the Huelva refinery with an investment of Eur1 billion. The plant will produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. The biofuels will be produced from organic waste, including used cooking oil and agricultural residues.

The plant will contribute to Cepsa's strategy to reach 2.5 million mt/year of biofuel production by 2030, making it a leader in the Iberian peninsula. The total will include 800,000 mt/year of SAF.

** Operator Petronor said May 2023 that owner Repsol and Saudi Aramco have taken a final investment decision to construct a synthetic biofuel plant at Bilbao that will be completed in 2025. The project was previously targeted for 2024.

The companies will invest Eur103 million between them to produce the fuel, which can be used in any combustion engine for road, air and sea vehicles.

The plant will be the first at industrial scale to use CO2 and green hydrogen as feedstock to output 2,100 mt/year of fuel, equal to 18,000 barrels. The project includes a 10 MW electrolyzer, which will have Enagas and Ente Vasco de Energia as partners. Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for a planned 100 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

** Greece's Helleniq Energy said in May 2023 that the pilot investment in "green" hydrogen at the Elefsis refinery "edges closer to the final investment decision," while projects for the production of biofuels, such as HVO and SAF at its refineries, are "in the implementation phase."

** OMV Petrom said May 2023 that it has signed a financing contract through the National Plan for Recovery and Resilience for the production of green hydrogen at the Petrobrazi refinery in Romania. The project involves putting into operation a capacity of 20 MW for production of hydrogen by water electrolysis, which will be powered by renewable energy. It is estimated to produce over 2,600 mt/year. The final investment decision is due to be made in 2024 with completion expected for 2025.

** Germany's Schwedt refinery will halt fossil fuel processing and be transformed into a "hydrogen hub" producing synthetic and biofuels and other products by 2045, the refinery's management said at a press conference, according to local media reports. The refinery, which can currently produce around 11 million mt/year of oil products, would be able to make about 1 million mt/year of synthetic aviation fuels, 1 million mt/year of methanol and high-value chemical products, and 1 million mt/year of biodiesel, ethanol and biomethane, according to the reports. In order to produce synthetic hydrocarbons, the refinery will need 800,000 mt/year of green hydrogen from 2045. By 2027 it is expected to have electrolyzer capacity of 400 MW which would be able to produce 30,000 mt/year of hydrogen, with production reaching 160,000 mt/year in 2030 and increasing further to 240,000 mt/year, renewable energy services provider Enertrag, which is working on the feasibility study for the plant's transformation together with the refinery's management, said in a statement May 9.

** Repsol said it was retrofitting the hydro units in all five Spanish refineries it operates to increase its use of bio feedstock as the business was starting to give positive impetus to its refining margins. Mild hydrocracker units at A Coruna, Bilbao and Puertollano as well as hydrocrackers at Cartagena and Tarragona will all be modified with no real capex impact, CEO Josu Jon Imaz said.

** The European Commission has approved a Eur158 million Polish green hydrogen support package for Poland's Gdansk refinery under state aid rules, it said in April 2023. PKN Orlen via its LOTOS Green H2 subsidiary plans a 100 MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen used in refinery processes as well as a 50 MW solar power plant and 20 MWh battery storage, it said. The electrolyzer is expected to start operating in 2027 and gradually increase production to 13,600 mt/year.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a hydrotreated vegetable oils installation at Plock. PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery. The unit will process used rapeseed oil to produce an additive to diesel or aviation fuel. The annual production of the unit will be 300,000 mt of biodiesel or aviation biofuel. The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a bioethanol unit at the company's small Polish biofuels plant, Orlen Poludnie. PKN Orlen is also constructing a hydrogen plant at its Poludnie biorefinery in Trzebinia. Annual production will be 16 million cu m, and three-quarters of that will be used to produce glycol. The remainder will be used to produce 45 kg/h of fuel-grade hydrogen for use in transport.

** PKN Orlen said its subsidiary Orlen Poludnie has signed an agreement to build a "complex of units for production of II generation bioethanol" at its biofuel refinery in Jedlicze, southern Poland. The B2G complex will include a main unit for bioethanol production and will have the capacity to produce 25,000 mt/year of bioethanol from biomass. In the next stage, a biogas plant will be built. The biomass will be mainly cereals straw sourced from Polish farmers. The bioethanol complex will also include a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant, which will generate heat for bioethanol production. The Jedlicze refinery is a small former petroleum refinery, which together with the Trzebinia refinery, was incorporated into Orlen Poludnie, the company's biofuels subsidiary.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

In Oct. 2021, Gunvor said it had agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Phillips 66 is looking at carbon capture and storage as well as electrolytic green hydrogen production to decarbonize operations at its Humber refinery in the UK, Commercial Manager for Emerging Energy Mike Wailes said Feb. 2023. The initial focus is on post-combustion capture from the refining process, including from the crude topping unit, fluid catalytic cracker and hydro-desulfurization unit, with further more expensive options coming from refueling to use hydrogen, he said.

Phillips 66 is developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to be powered by offshore wind which can be scalable to 300 MW.

The Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways in early 2022.

Phillips 66 has said previously its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Spain's Repsol is to build a new 25,000 mt/year production line for recycled polyethylene at its Puertollano site. The new line, which will produce high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) with a recycled plastic content of 10%-80%, was expected to come into operation by the end of 2024. Current capacity for the plastics production at the site is 16,000 mt/year. Puertollano is also due to start a first polyurethane foam recovery plant this year at Puertollano while it also has plans to build a new unit to produce 15,000 mt/year of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) to come online in 2024 with an investment of Eur105 million.

** Renewable hydrogen company Everfuel has signed an agreement in Jan. 2023 to supply oxygen to an undisclosed company from its HySynergy electrolyzer in Fredericia, Denmark, enabling a higher utilization of the plant. The conditional agreement will improve the overall utilization and efficiency of the second phase of the electrolyzer, providing a long-term revenue stream, Everfuel said. HySynergy 2.0 will extend the existing 20 MW electrolyzer with 300 MW of additional capacity by 2025. It will be developed with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia and will produce hydrogen to decarbonize industrial processes and transportation. The first 20-MW phase started hydrogen production in December, with first commercial deliveries due in 2023. The plant, adjacent to the Fredericia oil refinery, will supply renewable hydrogen to the facility and for local zero-emissions transport, Everfuel said. The plant will send 80% of the hydrogen produced to the refinery for use as a feedstock in the refining process. The remaining 20% will go to hydrogen mobility applications. Phase two is to be built in three 100-MW stages.

** Piling work for a new biofuel plant being built by Shell at the site of Europe's biggest refinery, Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam (formerly Pernis), was due to be completed around summer 2023, with the new plant expected to start up in 2024 or 2025. Shell is building an 820,000 mt/year biofuel plant in Rotterdam to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste. The facility will not use virgin palm oil as a feedstock although it will process vegetable oils, such as rapeseed, to supplement the waste feedstocks "until even more sustainable advanced feedstocks are widely available," it said.

** Repsol along with Spanish companies Naturgy and Reganosa plan to construct a hydrogen electrolyzer at Meirama, close to the A Coruna plant, with the output used to feed the refinery. The first phase of the project will see 30 MW of installed capacity by 2025 at the site of a closed thermal power plant. A subsequent upgrade will take the project to 200 MW capacity, producing 30,000 mt of green hydrogen per year. A newly installed hydrotreatment unit at Spain's A Coruna that processes vegetable and cooking oils was expected to boost biofuel output by 5,500 mt/year in 2022, with the volume rising to 10,500 mt/year by 2024.

** Turkey's Tupras said it had completed basic engineering studies to produce sustainable aviation fuel at its Izmir refinery using Honeywell's UOP ecofining technology. Tupras said it plans eventually to produce 400,000 mt/year of SAF, renewable diesel and other products at Izmir.

** Croatia's INA is studying options for its Sisak refinery, including a biorefinery, biogas plant and production of pure hydrogen.

** Italy's Eni said it was "investigating the opportunity to build a new bio-refinery at Eni's industrial site in Livorno." It will be Eni's third biorefinery in Italy after converting its Gela and Venice refineries into biofuel plants. Eni said its feasibility study involves building "three new plants for the production of hydrogenated biofuel: a biogenic feedstock pre-treatment unit, a 500,000 mt/year Ecofining plant and a plant for the production of hydrogen from methane gas." The design of the three plants will be completed by 2023 and construction by 2025. Local officials welcomed the potential conversion of the Livorno refinery into a biorefinery as it would maintain "the current workforce and the entire production chain."

** Italy's Eni has started producing SAF at its Taranto refinery in southern Italy, as part of its commitment to decarbonize all its products and processes by 2050. Eni plans to increase its bio-refining capacity to 5 million-6 million mt/year by 2050. Eni targets its SAF capacity to reach at least 500,000 mt/year by 2030. Eni said its SAF production will continue to grow with the start-up of over 10,000 mt/year of SAF from its Livorno refinery using bio-components produced in Eni's existing Gela and Venice bio-refineries. In 2024, Eni plans to launch SAF production at the Gela bio-refinery, where a project is underway for a further 150,000 mt/year of SAF production from 100% renewable raw materials by 2025.

** Italy's Eni said that it will install a 20 MW electrolyzer at its Gela biorefinery and a 10 MW electrolyzer at its Taranto refinery. The electrolyzers will be part of a project to develop green hydrogen by Enel Green Power and Eni which will receive public funding approved by the European Commission.

** Ineos has awarded a design contract for a planned 190,000 mt/year low-carbon hydrogen production plant at its Grangemouth refining and petrochemical site in Scotland to engineering company Atkins. The plant is expected to be operational by 2030.

** Essar, the owner of the UK's Stanlow refinery, said it has received a hydrogen-powered furnace, which is the first in the UK. The furnace has been commissioned by Essar Oil UK "as it transitions to run its operations on hydrogen as part of HyNet, the UK's leading decarbonization cluster," it said. The furnace, which will run on 100% hydrogen fuel from 2026, "forms a central part of Essar's strategy at Stanlow to become the UK's first low-carbon refinery." The furnace will replace three gas-fired furnaces at the plant's crude distillation unit. Essar is also developing 300,000 cu m of biofuel storage capacity at the site, allowing customers to store, blend and distribute biofuels for the road, aviation and marine sectors. It will become the UK's largest biofuels storage facility when completed.

** OMV Petrom will start producing SAF at its Petrobrazi refinery, which will become the first refinery in Romania to produce the fuel. The refinery will produce SAF by coprocessing locally produced rapeseed oil. In the future, it aims to increase the production capacities and produce sustainable fuels based on various waste feedstocks, such as used cooking oil. "Our goal is that, in 2030, to have an annual combined production of SAF and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil) of about 450 thousand tons," Radu Caprau, member of the Executive Board responsible for Refining & Marketing said.

** Repsol and partners Enerkem and Agbar have presented a project to transform 400,000 mt/year of urban waste to 220,000 mt/year methanol at Tarragona, which should start up in 2025 with an investment of Eur250 million. Spain's Tarragona has started on a series of energy transition projects, including the manufacture of biofuel for aviation and an advanced biofuels plant, which is already under construction. The refinery plans to build a 100-MW hydrogen electrolyzer by 2025.

** OMV said that together with AEG Fuels it will supply SAF from its Schwechat refinery on-demand for the "general aviation segment" to be used as an alternative to conventional jet fuel at the Vienna International Airport. SAF is produced at Schwechat by co-processing Austrian used cooking oil and is supplied via a direct pipeline connection to Vienna's international airport. OMV had also supplied the first batch of SAF to Vienna International Airport for fueling Austrian Airlines aircraft. Schwechat has received the two main components for producing SAF -- the reactor and column. From mid-2023 up to 160,000 mt of liquid biomass will be converted into SAF using an innovative co-processing method, it said. "The new reactor will process substances including vegetable oil together with other feedstocks in a procedure known as co-processing. This innovative process involves refining the biogenic feedstock via a hydrogenation process using hydrogen," OMV said. In the future, the process can be used for processing other feedstock such as used cooking oil or advanced biofuels. OMV plans to increase its SAF sales to more than 700,000 mt/year by 2030. Separately, OMV will build the country's largest electrolysis plant at the Schwechat refinery through a joint investment with Kommunalkredit Austria AG. The plant is expected to start in H2 2023. The 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis will produce up to 1,500 mt/year of green hydrogen.

** Germany's Bayernoil is looking at producing SAF from sewage sludge. It could convert 100,000 mt of sewage sludge into SAF annually under Project Bayosine. The processing, which involves pyrolisis, can be done in a new unit at the Vohburg site of the plant.

** Sweden's Preem aims to expand the HVO capacity at its Gothenburg plant from 320,000 cu m/year to 1.3 million cu m/year in 2026. "This is planned to take place in a completely new facility designed to produce renewable vehicle fuels and aviation fuels with great flexibility," it said. In its Lysekil plant, production of HVO from the Synsat plant "was the highest to date," the company said. Preem is rebuilding the existing Synsat plant, so it can produce renewable raw materials and replace part of the fossil production. It is expected to reach renewable production capacity of 950,000 cu m/year by 2024.

** Finland's UPM expects its Leuna biorefinery in Germany to be operational by the end of 2023 and ramp up in 2024. Construction of the facility, which will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals, started in 2020. Its total annual capacity will be 220,000 mt bio-monoethylene glycol and lignin-based renewable functional fillers. It will also produce monopropylene glycol and industrial sugars made from sustainably harvested beechwood sourced regionally in Germany.

** Greece's Motor Oil Hellas said its Corinth refinery by 2030 aims to enhance its pure hydrogen infrastructure through demonstration and scale-up of green hydrogen. In the long term, it aims to be a "large producer of clean hydrogen".

** Repsol's Cartagena has started construction of its planned second-generation biofuel plant at the nearby to the refinery Escombreras facility, which should result in the production of 250,000 mt/year of biodiesel from waste from mid-2023. The company will invest Eur200 million in the project that would output biodiesel, biojet, bionaphtha and biopropane, allowing an overall CO2 reduction of 900,000 mt/year. As part of its drive to decarbonize the refinery, Repsol also plans to build a 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer at Cartagena, with a target date of 2025.

** Orsted and BP are to jointly develop a 50 MW renewable hydrogen project at BP's Lingen refinery in Germany. The project, expected to be operational in 2024, would comprise a 50 MW electrolyzer capable of generating 9,000 mt/year of hydrogen, 20% of the refinery's current fossil-based hydrogen consumption. The electrolyzer is expected to be powered by an Orsted North Sea offshore wind farm. The partners have a longer-term ambition to build more than 500 MW of renewable hydrogen capacity at Lingen, providing renewable hydrogen to meet all the refinery's hydrogen demand and provide feedstock for future synthetic fuel production.

** Italian energy company Eni and SEA, the operator of Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, have signed an agreement to supply SAF for commercial flights, as a step towards accelerating the "ecological transition" of the two airports. Eni plans to develop Eni Biojet which will be made "exclusively" from used cooking oil or animal fats and can be "used in a blend with conventional jet fuel of up to 50%," Umberto Carrara, Director of Green/Traditional Refining and Market at Eni said. The company plans to produce around 200,000 mt/year by 2024 and double the production by 2030.

** BP has partnered with Dutch green hydrogen company HyCC to develop its 250-MW H2-Fifty electrolyzer project in Rotterdam. The companies will next select a technology partner for the previously announced renewable hydrogen project and begin environmental studies, with a final investment decision expected in 2023. The project is expected to come online in 2025. The renewable hydrogen produced at the facility will replace fossil-based feedstock at BP's Rotterdam refinery and other industries in the area. The plant will be situated in the Maasvlakte area of Rotterdam.

** Russia's Lukoil said in December 2021 that it has signed memorandum of intent with Rusatom Overseas, part of the Rosatom Group, to cooperate in the production and supply of green hydrogen for the company's Petrotel refinery in Ploesti, Romania.

** Varo Energy's Cressier refinery in Switzerland will use solar panel generated electricity by 19,000 photovoltaic panels for a "significant portion" of the electricity it consumes. Varo Energy Group and Groupe E will build the "most powerful ground-mounted solar facility in Switzerland" with an installed capacity of 7.7 MW. It will be built in the industrial zone east of the refinery. At full power, the park will be able to supply more than 60% of the refinery's needs.

** ExxonMobil, Macquarie's Green Investment Group, and SGN are studying the potential for a low-carbon hydrogen hub centered around ExxonMobil's Fawley refinery on the UK's south coast. Initial hydrogen production could be around 4.3 TWh/year from 2030. Hydrogen demand in the Southampton industrial cluster around the refinery could reach 37 TWh by 2050.

** Italy's Saras is working on activating a green hydrogen plant for a total of 20 MW. Saras is building the green hydrogen plant with Italian utility Enel. The hydrogen produced would be used at the Sarroch refinery. It is currently provided by the IGCC complex and two reforming units on the industrial site.

** The Refhyne II consortium, developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for Shell's Rheinland refinery in Germany at its Wesseling site, has received a Eur32.4 million grant from the EU. The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen at Gdansk. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

Austria supported[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austria-backs-eu-russia-sanctions-after-ukraine-removes-raiffeisen-blacklist-2023-12-16/] the EU's 12th sanction package against Russia after Ukraine suspended the inclusion of the Raiffeisen Bank in the war sponsors list, Reuters reported on Dec. 16, citing an EU diplomat.

Media reports emerged[https://kyivindependent.com/media-austria-posing-obstacle-to-eus-12th-sanctions-package-against-russia/] ahead of the Dec. 14-15 European Council summit that Vienna is delaying the newest package in an effort to remove the Austrian Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) from Kyiv's blacklist.

Even though EU countries publicly announced[https://kyivindependent.com/eu-agrees-to-12th-sanctions-package-against-russia/] the 12th package during the summit, EUObserver wrote that Austria continues[https://euobserver.com/world/157838] to hold out on account of the RBI.

The website of Ukraine's National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NAZK) now reads[https://sanctions.nazk.gov.ua/en/boycott/] that the inclusion of the RBI in the international sponsors of war list is "suspended for the period of bilateral consultations involving representatives of the European Commission."

"Austria has now lifted its reserve. Sanctions (against Russia) should now be formally adopted this coming week," Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist Rikard Jozwiak reported[https://twitter.com/RikardJozwiak/status/1736097603412971528].

Despite the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the RBI, Austria's second-largest bank lender, has continued to operate in Russia.

The bank has long-standing ties with Russia and is only one of only two foreign banks classified as "systemically important" by the Russian central bank.

Czechia opened[https://kyivindependent.com/czechia-investigates-raiffeisen-bank-due-to-its-russia-activities/] an investigation of the RBI in August over its ongoing business activities in Russia after the Czech Association for the Rights of Citizens and Entrepreneurs highlighted that Raiffeisen's Russia-based companies had paid up to $720 million from their profits to the Russian state budget in taxes.

The European Central Bank (ECB) urged[https://kyivindependent.com/reuters-european-central-bank-pushing-raiffeisen-to-exit-russian-market/] Raiffeisen on March 24 to devise an exit strategy for selling or shutting down the group's Russia branch of operations.

The bank responded to the criticism by saying that it is reducing its business activity in the country, minimizing "the RBI Group's cross-border exposure to Russia," and exploring ways of selling or spinning off its Russian branch, but no further updates have been provided.

Raiffeisen and Deripaska skirt Russia sanctions with €1.5bn deal

Asset swap will hand oligarch cash in exchange for his stake in Austria’s Strabag construction firm

Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank International has concluded a complex asset swap arrangement with Oleg Deripaska that skirts EU sanctions restrictions to hand the Russian oligarch roubles worth €1.5bn.

In a statement on Tuesday, RBI said its Russian subsidiary would make the cash payment to Deripaska in exchange for his 28 per cent shareholding in Austria’s Strabag, one of the largest construction companies in Europe.

Deripaska’s stake in Strabag — held through his company Rasperia — was frozen last year by the EU in response to what the bloc said was his complicity in Russia’s brutal war of aggression in Ukraine.

“In pursuing this transaction, RBI has diligently abided by and will continue to diligently abide by all sanction requirements,” the bank said in a statement.

It noted that closing of the acquisition was subject to conditions including regulatory approval and “satisfactory completion of the sanctions compliance due diligence by RBI”.

Deripaska did not respond to a request for comment.

RBI’s Russian subsidiary will transfer Rasperia’s holding in Strabag to its parent company via a dividend in kind, the bank added. That will require the subsidiary securing special approval from the Kremlin.

RBI has raked in vast profits since Russia’s war in Ukraine began, thanks to its position as the biggest European lender remaining in Russia.

In the first nine months of this year, more than half of the bank’s profits came from its Russian division. The bank is one of the biggest lenders in central and eastern Europe.

Moscow’s increasingly onerous restrictions on foreign businesses operating in its territory have meant that until now all of RBI’s earnings there have been marooned in the country.

RBI has come under mounting pressure to scale back its operations but has insisted it has few viable options for doing so without unnecessarily harming its shareholders.

The bank has previously explored complicated asset swaps with Russian entities under sanctions. The Financial Times reported in March that RBI had begun work on a possible €400mn deal with Sberbank’s frozen European holdings. The deal fell through after the state-owned Russian bank sold its assets to another party.

Deripaska was one of very few oligarchs in Russia to publicly criticise Russia’s war in Ukraine during its early phases — albeit indirectly. As Vladimir Putin’s domestic crackdown on dissent has grown in strength, however, Deripaska has become less vocal.

In an interview with the FT, in September, he said European sanctions against Russia were failing in their goals.

“I always doubted this Wunderwaffe [wonder-weapon], as Germans used to say, of the sanctions — weaponising the financial system as a kind of tool to negotiate,” he said.

The billionaire, who made his money through the aluminium smelter Rusal and energy company EN+, has long had strong business connections in Austria.

A crucial ally in the country is Siegfried “Sigi” Wolf, who served as chair of Deripaska’s engineering conglomerate Russian Machines. Wolf was also a long-serving former board member of Strabag and of the European subsidiary of Sberbank, which was headquartered in Vienna.

Wolf has also been a strong critic of sanctions against Russian businesses by Europe. He wrote a personal letter to Putin in April offering to use his experience as a member of the supervisory board of the Porsche Group to help rebuild Russia’s car industry, if the government would give him a big enough loan.

Miles Johnson talks to law enforcers who dealt a big blow to the super cartel

This is an audio transcript of Hot Money podcast Episode 8: The Red Notebook

Miles Johnson

Previously on Hot Money. The pressure on Daniel Kinahan is rising. His partners in the Dubai super cartel are starting to fall. And police around the world are working on a secret plan to take him down for good. 

It’s the morning of April 12th, 2022 and reporters and TV crews arrive at a press conference in Dublin that’s been called by the Irish police. Officially, there’ll be an update on how law enforcement agencies are working together to collaborate against international organised crime. But it’s a bit vague, perhaps suspiciously vague, and journalists are starting to speculate about what this press conference is really about.

Behind the scenes, John O’Driscoll, is getting nervous. John’s the assistant commissioner in charge of serious organised crime. Ever since his meeting with US officials three years before he’s been working on a single objective. And the press conference this morning in Dublin is going to be the moment he finally gets to announce it to the world. 

But John knows that if word gets out, it could all fall apart. He’s chosen the venue carefully.

I said that beyond any doubt it was not going to take place in those rooms that we may have had press conferences relating to the Kinahans previously.

Miles Johnson

Instead it would take place in Dublin’s city hall. It’s the right sort of setting for a historic announcement, marble floors, huge classical pillars and statues on ancient Roman-style plinths.

John O’Driscoll

The holding of the event in city hall was important, first of all, because it is that wonderful building that it is, but also it is situated in south inner city, Dublin, which is where the Kinahan organisation emerged from.

Miles Johnson

Quietly, senior officials from various foreign police forces have been flying into Dublin. People from the US Treasury, DEA, and Customs and Border Protection. Officials from Europol, and the UK’s national crime agency, including deputy director of investigations, Matt Horne.

Matt Horne

We’d arrived the day before from the UK, and had been extremely well looked after by the Garda from the airport.  And you know, they were keeping a very close eye on us to make sure that all the, all of us representatives of the international law enforcement community were sort of well looked after and well protected.

Miles Johnson

And despite all these high profile police officers arriving in Dublin at exactly the same time, John’s been able to kept things under wraps. Everyone is now seated. The hall falls quiet in anticipation. And John walks out onto the stage. Within minutes the Kinahans will become some of the most wanted men on the planet.

I’m Miles Johnson, and from the Financial Times and Pushkin Industries this is Hot Money: The New Narcos. Episode 8: The Red Notebook.

Back when I started at the FT as a trainee reporter 15 years ago, I never expected I’d end up writing about organised crime. We covered things like the stock market, and mergers and acquisitions. There was this very clear boundary back then between the world we wrote about, the world of business, CEOs, and politicians and the underworld. But something’s changed since then. The line between criminal activity and state backed enterprise, between big business and gangsters, it’s become fuzzier.

We live in a time where some heads of state increasingly act like crime bosses, and the crime bosses, they act like the heads of multinational companies. It could be a world leader investing billions into startups and tech companies, but at the same time ordering the murder of dissidents abroad. It could be North Korean state hackers stealing bitcoins to fund missile programmes, or Kremlin-backed tycoons using mercenary armies to mine for gold in Africa. Or it could be a cocaine cartel, hiding out in Dubai while carrying out contract killings in Europe for a sanctioned regime.

It’s all part of the rise of a new type of criminal boss, one backed by authoritarian governments. I call them state-backed gangsters. And they’re thriving at a time when the world is becoming more fragmented, and more chaotic.

Reporting on the Dubai super cartel, I’ve discovered that European drug traffickers have been taking advantage of the same money laundering channels that Iran uses to evade western sanctions. That seems to be the reason why international criminals have become unlikely bedfellows with a theocratic regime. 

That press conference that John’s arranged, he knows it could be the beginning of the end for the super cartel. But before we get to that, I want to take a little detour.

Because there’s an important question from the start of this series that we still don’t have an answer to. The murder broker was convicted for arranging the assassination of Ali Motamed, the electrician who was on the run from Iran.

But no one has ever been able to find out who in Iran gave the murder broker his orders. And during the reporting of this series, I came across something that might help us get one step closer. It was a case that revealed a tonne of new information about the way that Iran secretly pursues its enemies in Europe, people like Ali Motamed.

And there’s someone I want to talk to because he was directly involved in that case. Someone who has first hand experience of the long history of violence against enemies of the Iranian regime, wherever they are in the world.

Hossein Abedini was born in Iran, but he now lives in London. He’s in his late 50s and he’s quietly spoken, but he’s been fighting for most of his life.

Hossein Abedini

I have been with the resistance over three decades now, nearly four decades. 

Miles Johnson

In the Spring of 1990, Hossein was a young activist. And he was in Turkey. He says he traveled there to try and stop the deportation of Iranian refugees who’d crossed the border illegally. One day In Istanbul, he’s in a car with two colleagues. They’re on the motorway when suddenly something blocks the road ahead. The traffic slows down. Hossein is up front, sitting next to the driver.

Hossein Abedini

And all of a sudden, we heard, you know, the sound of bullets. They riddled our car from the back.

Miles Johnson

Hossein barely has time to take in that someone is shooting at them, when a car smashes into the front of their vehicle. They can’t drive away.

Hossein Abedini

And another car pinned us from behind. It was then which I realized, you know, this was a, this was an assassination or kidnapping.

Miles Johnson

A man jumps out of the vehicle in front, the one that’s just plowed into their car. He’s holding a revolver. 

Hossein Abedini

And it was only, I think, a couple of meters before he reached our car. I tried to do something. There was a briefcase belonging to my female colleague who was sitting the back of the car, so I just took that, opened the door, and went to stop him. 

Miles Johnson

He’s clutching the briefcase like a shield as the man starts shooting.

Hossein Abedini

The first bullet hit my chest, and uh, I didn’t know how many bullets, you know, I received then. And, uh I just, fell down, fell down in the street. 

Miles Johnson

Hossein’s lying on the ground, bleeding and he can see the man walk up to him. He’s preparing to take a final shot. But nothing happens. 

Hossein Abedini

The bullet jammed in the muzzle of the gun. 

Miles Johnson

That’s Hossein’s first lucky break. 

The traffic starts to move again and the assassins take off. Hossein desperately needs to get to the hospital, but the car he was in is smashed up and everyone else on the motorway, they seem to be trying to run away as quickly as they can. 

Hossein Abedini

I remember very vaguely that my colleague threw herself, you know, in front of one of the cars. And, there was a taxi which stopped. And I was put at the back of the taxi. And I, I just got unconscious. The hospital was only three minutes away. If it was farther than that, I wouldn’t make it.

Miles Johnson

Hossein fell into a coma. It would be 50 days before he woke up. He was told that one bullet had passed very close to his heart and another had destroyed his liver. But even at the hospital, he’s not safe. The killers, they come back, and this time they’re posing as his friends

Hossein Abedini

But my true friends arrived and they were told, you know, that there are other people who wanted to come and see me. And then those people escaped from the scene when they realised, you know, there were people, my true friends, you know, were there. 

Miles Johnson

That’s Hossein’s second stroke of luck. 

And there will be a third one as well, when the killers call up, pretending to be the police. They tell the hospital staff that they know Hossein is now conscious, and they want to interview him about what happened.

Hossein Abedini

But the president of Turkey in those days was Turgut Özal and his mother, you know, was in the same hospital. The president wanted to come and visit his mother and they sealed off the whole area, the hospital. And they realised there was another branch of police who wanted to come and see me. And they found out that was a bogus call, it was the Iranian regime who wanted to get rid of me because they didn’t want me to speak. That was very pure luck.

Miles Johnson

That was more than 30 years ago. Hossein tells me that he’s still affected every day by the damage done to his liver in that attack. But he’s one of the rare survivors of an assassination attempt by the Iranian regime. Several of his friends and colleagues have been murdered since then.

Today Hossein is a senior member of Iran’s main foreign opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran or the NCRI. 

Hossein Abedini

So the main objective of the National Council of Resistance of Iran is to establish a democratic and a secular government in Iran.  Its main principle, of course, has been against any dictatorship, whether it’s the former dictatorship of the Shah or the present medieval dictatorship of the mullahs.

Miles Johnson

The NCRI, its an umbrella organisation and one of the largest groups within it is called the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, known by its Farsi initials, MEK.

Now the MEK, it hasn’t always had the west’s approval. It was implicated in several terrorist attacks against Iran, including the 1981 bombing that Tehran claimed was carried out by Ali Motamed, the quiet electrician in the Netherlands. From 1997 to 2012 the MEK was designated as a terror organisation by the US government. But over the past decade it’s refashioned itself. And now it’s a pretty influential opposition voice on Iran. But for all its acceptance by western powers, the NCRI remains a top target of the Iranian regime. 

In June 2018, Hossein and his colleagues are in Paris. They’re holding a huge meeting, a rally called the Free Iran World Summit.

Hossein Abedini

Tens of thousands of Iranians with many non Iranian supporters of the resistance who came from 67 different countries throughout the world.

Miles Johnson

Dozens of foreign politicians are invited as well, and everyone convenes in a vast conference centre. It’s only afterwards that Hossein finds out what very nearly happened.

Hossein Abedini

I think it was on the 1st of July, the next day, I was told by a friend that the Belgian federal police, you know, they had arrested two Iranians who were trying, you know, to bring a bomb.  

Miles Johnson

Belgian police had arrested two Iranians who were on their way to the Paris conference centre with a bomb. It’s another lucky escape for Hossein and hundreds of other people. And as police investigate the failed bomb plot, they’re going to discover something that I believe could shed new light on the murder of Ali Motamed. It’s the most important discovery in decades about how Iran targets its enemies abroad. And this time, the clues aren’t just glimpses, hints, or encrypted messages. They are in a battered red notebook filled with handwritten notes, sitting in the back of a car.

So Hossein and his colleagues, they discover that someone had tried to plant a bomb at the rally in Paris. And at the same time, police in Germany arrest an Iranian man on a highway in Bavaria.

His name is Assadollah Assadi, and officially, he’s the third counsellor of the Iranian embassy in Vienna. He arrived in Europe in 2014. But in reality, he’s a top spy for Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security. It’s Iran’s equivalent of the CIA or MI6. Assadi is running a network of agents across Europe, meeting them in cafes in small medieval towns handing over secret instructions or bundles of cash. And months before the Paris rally he traveled to Tehran, returning to Europe with a sophisticated bomb hidden in his diplomatic luggage.  

The bomb’s made from an explosive known as TATP or “Mother of Satan”.  It’s extremely volatile. 

Assadi carries it on to Luxembourg and hands it over to his agents. And this part of the story, it’s a bit less like a Le Carré novel, because the venue he chooses, it’s a Pizza Hut.

He gives them the bomb, with instructions for planting it at the Paris rally. And the codeword he uses is “playstation”. But what Assadi doesn’t know, is that European intelligence agencies have been watching his every move, and know exactly what he’s been planning. They even disabled the airport security scanner so he could get through. The two agents are arrested as they travel from Brussels to Paris. 

Assadi is pulled over by the police on a motorway in Germany. And in the back of his car, they find the battered red notebook filled with handwritten notes. Notes that reveal that Assadi was involved in way more than one bomb plot.

Assadi has listed hundreds of different meetings with agents across Europe. He’s itemised cash payments he’s made to spies, and he’s listed more than 200 places he’s visited as part of his work in 11 different countries. Because Assadi, according to the findings of a Belgian criminal court, is part of a secret unit of Iranian foreign intelligence, a sort of murder squad in Europe. It’s called Department 312. And its role is to kill opponents of the regime abroad.

There’s not much public information about Department 312. But what we do know, its pretty terrifying. It’s thought to be a top secret unit that specialises in spying on human rights activists, journalists and others who the Iranian regime believe to be a threat. 

But was Ali Motamed one of their targets?

We know that Assadi arrived in his new job in June 2014. A little over a year before Ali Motamed was killed outside his house in Almere. It was the first successful targeted assassination carried out by Iran in western Europe in over 23 years. And then two years later, in 2017, while Assadi was still free, another Iranian opposition member was gunned down in the Netherlands. So we can say that Assadi arrives in Vienna in late 2014 and then suddenly Iran is linked to several assassinations in Europe.

This isn’t conclusive evidence. But according to the Belgian criminal court documents, targeting dissidents, that was Assadi’s job. So it makes sense that he would at least be a suspect in the Motamed murder.

And we also know that Assadi, he was reporting into really top people in Iran, including the deputy minister of intelligence. After his arrest for the bomb plot, Assadi is put on trial in Belgium, and he gets prison visits from some of Iran’s most senior spies, and other officials from its foreign ministry. They clearly cared a lot about this case. 

The criminal case against Assadi was brought by the Belgian government, but there were also 25 others who joined as private plaintiffs. They were all at that Paris rally and Hossein was one of them, and it gave him access to all the prosecution’s evidence. He sent me the files.

This is hundreds of pages of documents, in several European languages and there’s also extracts from Assadi’s red notebook. And there’s something else, something that I think could be important. Assadi’s job meant that he had to travel a lot on work trips across Europe to meet with his various agents. And it turns out that even spies use Booking.com, the huge online travel agent, to book their hotels or at least Assadi did. And the details of all of those bookings, they’re in the files.

So I am sat here, in the offices of the Financial Times, looking at these records every hotel Assadi stayed in over his four years operating in Europe.

For some of the bookings, he used his official Iranian foreign ministry email address. For others it was burner accounts from Yahoo and Gmail. He seems to have met his agents in some pretty low-key locations. And he often seemed to book two hotels in different places for the same night, maybe thinking it would throw off anyone who was following him. And the records, they do show that he traveled to the Netherlands. On the 6th of September 2016, less than a year after Motamed was murdered, he stayed at the Best Western in The Hague for one night. 

The next evening Assadi booked two hotel rooms, one in the Dutch town of Meppel, and another in Zwartsluis, both really small towns. And in April 2017, Assadi booked a room at the Savoy Amsterdam for one of his agents. So we know he was working in the Netherlands at around the same time that Ali Motamed was murdered. It’s far from a smoking gun, but it’s enough, enough for me to ask Hossein, does he think that Assadi could have been connected to the murder of Mohamed Reza Kolahi, also known as Ali Motamed? I lay out what we know.

So he arrives, Asadi arrives in Austria in 2014. And then in 2015 a man called Mohamed Reza Kalahi, who was living in a town Almere, was shot and killed outside his house.

The murder has never been solved. They know who shot him. They know who told those people to shoot him. The Dutch government then said, we believe the Iranian regime was behind this murder and they expelled two diplomats. But there’s never been any, any further information about who could have co-ordinated a plot like that.

Do you think it’s reasonable to assume that Assadi could have been behind something like that?

Hossein Abedini

Well I don’t have precise information about this case, but I think it makes sense to believe that, of course, I mean, when Assadi was the, you know, the head of this intelligence section in mainly the western Europe, I think that is, this could very well be, I mean, Assadi could very well be behind that.

Miles Johnson

So its reasonable to assume you know, that we have a spy working under diplomatic cover who is in charge of all of western Europe and his focus is effectively organising assassination attempts against opposition figures. So it’s a reasonable assumption, to think that, of the assassinations, or attempted assassinations that occurred in western Europe after 2014, he presumably would have had to have some, had a hand in it?

Hossein Abedini

He’s had a hand in it. Absolutely. 

Miles Johnson

What Hossein says of course it doesn’t prove anything. But at the very least, Assadi has to be considered a suspect. There is this new wave of assassinations in Europe, all connected to the Iranian state, and they begin just after Assadi is posted to Vienna in 2014. 

And the first, it’s the murder of an electrician in a small Dutch town a year later. Assadi’s convicted for the attempted bombing in Paris and he’s sentenced to 20 years for attempted murder and plotting a terrorist attack. Iran denies any involvement. But we’ll never know if he was involved in Ali Motamed’s death. Because after Assadi’s convicted, a Belgian aid worker is arrested in Iran on these trumped up charges of espionage and sentenced to 40 years in prison and 74 lashes.

Then, in May 2023, the Belgian government agreed to exchange Assadi for the aid worker. So Assadi, he’s now back in Iran. And, his notebook aside, he’s taken his secrets with him.

It’s the 12th of April 2022 and we’re back in Dublin’s City Hall. The entire time John O’Driscoll has been working on a plan to sanction the Kinahans, he’s been worried about it leaking. Because he knows that if the news gets out, they’ll quickly be able to hide their assets before they are frozen.

[VOICE CLIP OF DREW HARRIS]

Today is a landmark day in the fight against organised crime

Miles Johnson

But now the Kinahans have run out of time. 

[VOICE CLIP OF DREW HARRIS]

And in particular against the Kinahan organised crime gang. 

Miles Johnson

John’s boss Drew Harris, commissioner of the Irish police, steps up to the podium. 

[VOICE CLIP OF DREW HARRIS]

This organised crime gang started life as a south inner city Dublin drug dealers but has grown over the decades to become a transnational crime cartel . . . that is estimated to have generated over €1bn for them.

Miles Johnson

Then a senior official from the US Treasury announces the news that will make headlines around the world. 

[VOICE CLIP OF GREG GATJANIS]

So as of today, the Kinahan Transnational Criminal Organisation joins the ranks of Italy’s Camorra, Mexico’s Los Zetas, Japan’s Yakuza and Russia’s Thieves in Law. Also as of today as a result of these sanctions these individuals are immediately severed from the US financial system and any assets, property under US jurisdiction are immediately blocked at this moment.   

Miles Johnson

We have to stop here for a minute just to take this all in. It’s utterly remarkable. A criminal family that began in a Dublin flat in the 1980s, is now being compared to the Yakuza and Camorra crime groups whose origins date back hundreds of years. They’ve been sanctioned by the US government, one of a handful of organised crime groups to ever face that kind of penalty.  And the US also puts a $5mn bounty on the heads of Christy, Daniel and his brother Christopher Junior, calling their organisation “a threat to the entire licit economy through its role in international money laundering”. 

Detective Chief Superintendent Seamus Boland, he knows that the US sanctions will destroy the Kinahans’ chance of continuing their life of luxury in Dubai.

Seamus Boland

Because the dangers with sanctions is that if any legitimate business engages with somebody who’s on a sanctions list, they’re actually the people who are committing the criminal offenses and they risk all their assets being seized and they risk being prosecuted. So you know, avenues to live the high life that you would’ve had before are closed down very, very quickly.

You know, people end up with so much money from cocaine trafficking. Behind all this, it’s all about greed. You have money to try and live in your big house, drive your fancy car. Fly business class all across the world. Stay in the best hotels. What the sanctions actually does is it removes a lot of the facilitation that would be possible for people to live their lives and to benefit from the illicit wealth that they’ve actually achieved. 

Miles Johnson

Soon, the United Arab Emirates freeze Daniel’s assets too, and they impose their own sanctions on the Kinahans in Dubai, removing one of the last places on earth they can hide. The Kinahans, they go on the run.

Seamus Boland

Significant parties within the Kinahan organised crime group all went to ground, and have been attempting to evade justice, and hide in the shadows since that date. But from our own information and intelligence and, and conversations with other criminals as well. You know, I think this, this took it to, to a different level because the criminal underworld in Europe didn’t anticipate that sanctions was something that would happen on this side of the Atlantic.

Miles Johnson

But the strange thing is, it’s been more than a year since that big announcement in Dublin, and the Kinahans, they’re all still at large. It’s not clear where they are. 

I’ve heard multiple rumors. Some think that they are still in the UAE, living under false identities. Others think they are somewhere else in the Middle East, laying low. I’ve even heard speculation that they’re building connections with Putin’s Russia.  

So I asked Seamus, why haven’t the police been able to bring them in yet?

Seamus Boland

Well, investigations are still ongoing as well at the moment. So the sanctions was only one phase of a much wider investigation that’s continuously ongoing and, and taking place. And as was announced in, in April 2022 at the designation as well, you know, extradition warrants were, were in place for one of the principals, who’s sought for, for charges in relation to murder and, and directing organized crime. And that’s still outstanding as well. But you can rest assured that investigations are continuing actively across many different jurisdictions. 

Miles Johnson

For a few years, the men who gathered at Daniel Kinahan’s wedding in 2017 seemed almost invincible. They created a new model, stateless gangsters, using modern technology to run global mafias in ways that were impossible a few decades before. 

But eventually, their reputation caught up with them. They made the mistake of becoming too public, too brazen. I began reporting on this story because I think it tells us something important about how the world is changing. And the global shifts that made the Dubai super cartel possible, they’re only accelerating. 

The criminals of the future, I think they’re going to be more global, more sophisticated and more dangerous. And I think it’s going to get harder to tell if someone is a gangster, a businessman, or both.

The story of the super cartel, for me, it’s an ominous sign of these new, hybrid threats that democracies face, and of governments’ weakening ability to fight them. The sanctions against the Kinahans, they’ve been hailed as a victory, a landmark in co-ordinated action by western governments to take down a major crime group. But there’s something I’ve kept asking myself, were the sanctions a show of strength, or really just a sign of weakness?

Some of the world’s most powerful governments have teamed up to go after the Kinahans, but a year later, they are still out there. So the Dubai super cartel may be finished, but its model will live on. And perhaps, something new, and maybe worse, will take its place. In fact, somewhere out there, it probably already has. 

Not long before the sanctions were announced, Rafaelle Imperiale, the Van Gogh boss, was arrested in Dubai and sent to Italy. He’s since agreed to become a state’s witness. And in November 2023 he told Italian prosecutors he would sell off his $80mn private island in Dubai, in the hope of his sentence being reduced.

MTK, the boxing company that Daniel Kinahan co-founded, it closes. And back in the Netherlands, where we began our story, Paul Vugts, the crime reporter, has been able to come out of police protection and return to his normal life. 

Paul Vugts

We wanted our life back in full. So not riding an armored car, but riding a bike and sitting on a terrace.

Miles Johnson

Ulysse Ellian, the local councilor in Almere who campaigned about the Ali Motamed murder, well he’s now a national politician. In 2021 he was elected to the Dutch parliament.

Ulysse Ellian

Look, you know, I was like this baby when I got here, my father had like $20 in his pocket. The honor of representing the Dutch people, it’s massive for me. My goal in life is defending democracy, defending freedom. And that relates to the story of my dad and also this story, look how dangerous the world around us can be.  

Miles Johnson

And the Kinahans, they have to live every day knowing they are being hunted by police. For Michael O’Sullivan, the man who first arrested Christy Kinahan in a Dublin flat back in the 1980s, it’s only a matter of time.

Michael O’Sullivan

You feel like saying to them, did you not think this day would come by doing what you’re doing? Better people than them have been caught. And they have made themselves a global target. And with the DEA on your case, the world is a small place and it gets smaller.

Austria is said to sanction blackmail to keep Raiffeisen in Russia

Austria is seeking to remove Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) from a Ukrainian blacklist of sponsors of the full-scale military invasion of Ukraine in return for supporting the latest EU sanctions on Russia, Reuters reports citing unnamed sources.

Reportedly, Austria and RBI are pushing for the bank to be taken off a Ukrainian list dubbed "international sponsors of war" – which puts pressure on companies to stop doing business in Russia and indirectly supporting the war effort by paying taxes and otherwise contributing to the aggressor’s economy.

As covered in detail by bne IntelliNews, RBI came under heavy regulatory pressure to come up with an exit plan from Russia, the country where it made 60% of its net profit last year.

Earlier in October, Austria's foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, openly criticised that blacklist as arbitrary at a meeting of European ministers in Kyiv, one of the unnamed sources told Reuters. Raiffeisen is the only Austrian company on the list.

Reportedly RBI envoys also met representatives of Ukraine's National Agency of Corruption Prevention, which drew up the list, to discuss how to get the group off it, the sources said. Notably, such tactics have apparently helped to remove Hungary's OTP Bank from the list.

RBI has scaled down its Russian business and is reportedly considering the sale of the business as a whole, or the splitting off of the Russian business into a separate entity, as well as a controversial swap of its loans for those of Russia’s Sberbank that are trapped in Europe by sanctions.

But most recent reports suggested that in reality RBI is delaying plans to leave Russia, hoping that the full-scale military invasion of Ukraine will end before the bank will have to cave in to sanctions pressure and scrap its presence in the country.

“Russian authorities made it clear to RBI that they wish it to stay because it enables international payments,” sources told Reuters back in July.

Austrian campaigners target secret Abramovich villa

Russia sanctions

In Austria's picturesque Salzkammergut, a scandal has erupted over a luxury villa secretly bought by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and why official documents relating to the transaction might have been shredded. Nearly two years into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the affair is shining an unflattering light on how Austria became a playground for Kremlinconnected billionaires, some of Vladimir Putin's most loyal lieutenants, taking advantage of poor oversight and offshore structures to secretly acquire palatial properties across the country.

With sweeping EU sanctions now in force against many of the Russians, a handful of opposition Austrian politicians and campaigners are trying to expose, and in some cases oust, their unwanted guests.

In November, details of the purchase in 2007 of the Fisherman's House on the Fuschlsee, an emerald alpine lake just east of Salzburg, came to light in a leak of offshore documents from Cyprus.

They showed that the property's buyer, a British woman whom locals believed to be an investment banker, was in fact a proxy for Abramovich.

Abramovich was placed under sanction by the EU in March 2022 for his "long and close ties" to the Russian president. The measures mean his assets across the bloc have been frozen.

The Fisherman's House, however, is owned by his daughter Anna, who is not subject to sanctions and was "gifted" the villa in 2017. The property's modest name belies its value. It was bought in a rundown state for €11mn 16 years ago and millions have since been spent on the buildings, which date back to 1637.

Now the local Green party is campaigning to have the Fisherman's House taken back and believes it can do so using the technicalities of local property law. Green MPs allege that laws regulating property sales to non-EU citizens, which demand disclosure of ownership and usage, were circumvented when the house was acquired. They say the sale should be voided.

They have just one problem: the official documents from 2007, which detail what was said about the property's owners, have been destroyed.

"The paper[s] may have been accidentally thrown away when the department moved," said Martin Zauner, a far-right politician who is a member of the Salzburg regional coalition government and is responsible for property matters, to the astonishment of parliamentarians last month.

Legal experts and opposition politicians have questioned the discrepancy and highlighted "mysterious" inconsistencies in the regional government's explanations. "The coincidence [of the files disappearing] has crooked optics," Lukas Hock, a lawyer told Der Standard newspaper.

"We now know that the British woman who bought the house had never really been buying it for herself. She was lent the money by Abramovich's trusts and she was only ever acting as his agent," said Simon Heilig-Hofbauer., a local Green MP.

But, he added, to take back the property they needed to prove that misstatements were made on the record at the time. "That's where the problem begins. My wish would be that the whole sale of this property can be unwound."

Abramovich's representatives did not respond to a request for comment.

The Fisherman's House was not even the most opulent property locally connected to Russian oligarchs under sanction, Heilig-Hofbauer said.

On the Attersee, 10km east, is the Waldschlössl, a pocket palace that belongs to Igor Shuvalov, Russia's former first deputy prime minister.

Technically, the Attersee property is owned by a Liechtenstein trust, which exploits a quirk of Austrian law. But its ties to the Kremlin are clear.

"Even Putin used to come and visit it," said Heilig-Hofbauer.

A Teodor Currentzis concert at the Wiener Festwochen was canceled after the Ukrainian conductor Oksana Lyniv, also on the program, raised concerns about his ties to Russia.

When the Wiener Festwochen, a prestigious festival that brings leading international artists to Vienna, announced this spring’s lineup, the backlash was swift and fierce.

The festival had planned to make the Russian invasion of Ukraine a focus of its programming, juxtaposing an appearance by the Ukrainian conductor Oksana Lyniv with a concert by the maestro Teodor Currentzis[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/arts/music/teodor-currentzis-shed-verdi-requiem.html], who has faced scrutiny over his connections to Russia[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/arts/music/teodor-currentzis-musicaeterna.html]. Critics, including Lyniv, had argued that the pairing was insensitive and ignored the suffering of Ukrainians.

Now, after weeks of pressure, the festival has abandoned its plan, saying that it would cancel[https://www.festwochen.at/en/presseaussendung-12-februar] the appearance by Currentzis while moving forward with the one by Lyniv.

“The decision was clear and there was no alternative,” Milo Rau, the festival’s artistic director, said in an interview on Tuesday. “This was the best solution from bad ones.”

Since Russia invaded Ukraine, many cultural organizations have severed ties with close associates of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the government there. Some institutions have been criticized for overreach after canceling performances by Russian artists with no known connections to the government. Others have grappled with how to handle artists who had less clear-cut allegiances.

Currentzis, a Greek-born, Russian-trained maestro whose leadership of the Russian ensemble MusicAeterna turned him into one of the world’s most prominent conductors, has been at the center of the discussion because of his relationship with VTB Bank, a Russian state-owned institution that has been under sanction[https://www.nytimes.com/article/russia-us-ukraine-sanctions.html]s by the United States and other countries. VTB Bank was the main sponsor of MusicAeterna. Currentzis has also drawn scrutiny for his association with Russian officials: In 2014, Putin awarded Currentzis citizenship by presidential decree.

Currentzis has refrained from publicly commenting on the war. But as criticism has mounted, he announced[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/01/arts/music/teodor-currentzis-utopia-musicaeterna.html] in 2022 that he would form a new international ensemble, Utopia, with the support of donors outside Russia. He continues to conduct in Russia, according to MusicAeterna’s website[https://musicaeterna.org/participant/teodor-currentzis/].

His appearance in Vienna was to be part of a tour in June with the SWR Symphony Orchestra of Germany, which he leads as chief conductor[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/arts/music/teodor-currentzis-swr-orchestra.html], performing Benjamin Britten’s “War Requiem.” He was to appear with the Vienna Boys’ Choir and the London Symphony Chorus.

Representatives for Currentzis did not respond to requests for comment. Anke Mai, the SWR program director, said in a statement that she regretted the Wiener Festwochen’s decision to cancel the performance. She said the orchestra had never asked Currentzis to make a statement on the war “in view of the consequences that such a statement would have for Currentzis in Russia.” She added that she believed Currentzis and the orchestra were “sending a message that cannot be misunderstood” by choosing to perform the “War Requiem,” which is a call for peace.

“All those involved would have liked to bring this message to Vienna,” Mai said. “Nevertheless, we accept the decision of the Wiener Festwochen and hope to meet again in more peaceful times.”

Rau, the festival’s artistic director, who has a reputation as a provocative stage director[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/theater/milo-rau-ntgent-controversy.html], said he had invited Currentzis to perform[https://www.festwochen.at/en/war-requiem] in part because he was interested in the idea of starting a conversation about art in wartime. Lyniv was also invited to lead the Kyiv Symphony Orchestra and the National Choir of Ukraine in a performance[https://www.festwochen.at/en/kaddish-requiem] of the Ukrainian composer Yevhen Stankovych’s oratorio “Kaddish Requiem,” written to remember the 1941 massacre of Jews near Kyiv by Nazis[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/movies/babi-yar-context-review.html].

Rau said he was troubled by Currentzis’s ties to Russian institutions. But he said he felt he had created a context in which he could appear.

“We decided this would be a nice thing to try to have this exchange,” he said. “It was very intentional to say that we want to have something that is difficult and that is questionable.”

Soon after the plans were announced, Lyniv issued a statement in protest, saying that she worried about “whitewashing” Currentzis.

“I cannot be responsible to the almost 150 musicians who are traveling to Vienna from the war in Ukraine to be put in the same context as Teodor Currentzis,” she said in a statement at the time. “Currentzis’s connections to Russia and his silence on this war of aggression against my homeland make it impossible for me to appear in a context with him at the moment.”

Lyniv, who is in New York this month preparing to conduct “Turandot” at the Metropolitan Opera, said she was pleased by the festival’s decision but declined to comment further.

As he searched for a solution, Rau spoke in recent days with artists and administrators. He said that he had received more than 50 messages about his decision to cancel the performance by Currentzis, many of them critical.

“The festival is big; we have 35 productions,” he said. “But in this specific case I failed, and I’m sad about it. But I’ve failed so many times. It’s part of the job.”
