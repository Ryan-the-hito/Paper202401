The European Union Heads of State and Government defined a framework of sanctions to apply to Russia for the attack on and invasion of Ukraine, to be specified by the Foreign Affairs Council, which will meet today, said Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa at the end of the Special meeting of the European Council in Brussels.[https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/european-council/2022/02/24/]

The European Union expressed solidarity with Ukraine, he said, adding that "the response given by the European Council was financial support, humanitarian aid", in addition to "a series of very harsh measures on Russia and a series Russian personalities, as well as from Belarus".

"The European Union is not a military organisation and, as such, what we approved was to endorse a proposal by the European Commission" for a second package of harsh sanctions "that seek to hit in particular the financial sector, the energy sector, the transport sector, to curb Russian State enterprises' capacity to secure international financing, as well as restrict visas for holders of diplomatic or service passports", he said.

The Prime Minister also stated that several EU member states "have been offering bilateral support to Ukraine, including military support by offering lethal and non-lethal material".

Military deterrence

"NATO will surely offer response in deterrence and to ensure the defence of all NATO countries, especially those that border with Ukraine or are close to Ukraine borders", at the extraordinary virtual meeting of NATO Heads of State and Government[https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/events_192464.htm] today.

NATO "is a defence alliance", whose "duty is that of solidarity with all the Alliance member countries - Ukraine is not an Alliance member country" and NATO cannot naturally operate beyond its own territory and without defending its members", he claimed.

António Costa stated that "Russia went from violating international law to war against a free and democratic country and therefore this is a war on a democratic state's freedom of self-determination".

"The European Council had the opportunity to hold a video conference with President Volodymyr Zelensky", who reported what is happening in his country, "clearly denying the version of this being a military mission focused on the separatist regions", and that it is "large-scale action on the whole of Ukrainian soil, namely its capital Kiev", he said.

The Prime Minister underlined that "if Russia continues" with this attack, the EU "will consider additional measures". The European Council tasked the European Commission to study a third sanction package.

Refugees

The Prime Minister stated that Portugal "drew attention that Europe should not repeat past situations of unpreparedness in humanitarian crises that are predictable in this case and, therefore, it should start preparing the mechanisms to take in" Ukrainian refugees.

Portugal reiterated its full availability to "share with all other member states" the "duty to assure everyone's international protection" and António Costa recalled that "in the concrete case of Ukrainian people, Portugal has had a very positive experience with the Ukrainian community that has been living here for almost 20 years"

"The Minister of State, Economy and Digital Transition [Pedro Siza Vieira] and the Minister of Labour, Solidarity and Social Security [Ana Mendes Godinho] have been in contact with a large number of companies to identify jobs to offer", he claimed.

Taking in refugees

Portugal is therefore in a condition to "offer the data for the occupational profile suited to the different job opportunities, which luckily exist at this time, and which are, in fact, fundamental for the Portuguese economy's recovery".

António Costa said that Portugal advocates, as it did in the past "on other refugees that the principle of European solidarity is to be upheld, that all member states must be available", at the onset "those which, due to their geographical location, for having a shared border, will naturally be the first to be requested for international protection", "in this specific case, it will most likely be Poland".

Portugal will ensure "visas are immediately granted to relatives, friends or acquaintances of Ukrainian residents in Portugal, who wish to reside in Portugal" and the consulates and embassies "in Ukraine and neighbouring countries" have already been informed.

The EU Ministers of Foreign Affairs approved a new "powerful third package of sanctions targeting the Russian Federation[https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/fac/2022/02/27/]", during an informal video conference, said Portuguese Minister of State and Foreign Affairs in a statement to Lusa press agency.

In the economic field, the sanctions envisage "denying any financial transaction from the European Union with the Russian Central Bank" and banning the use of the Swift system in important Russian sectors". The Swift is a financial messaging system that connects around 11 thousand banks and financial institutions for transactions. It is the core of the global financial system.

In the field of isolating Russia internationally, the ministers decided on "a coordinated action by all Member States to close EU airspace to Russian aircraft", he said. Portugal has already informed the Russian airline that its airspace is closed to them.

"The measures on eliminating transactions with the Russian Central Bank, keeping Russia off the Swift system and closing EU airspace to Russian aircraft are measures effective immediately, to be implemented in the coming hours or days", he added.

Unprecedented decisions

The Minister noted the "political decision" of authorizing, for the first time, the European Peace Facility to finance the purchase of lethal equipment to the sum of 450 million euros and non-lethal equipment to the sum of 50 million euros as "very important". It is the first time this has happened.

Another unprecedented measure has been to stop media outlets from broadcasting that "are part of the Russian propaganda and disinformation apparatus", he noted.

"All of these situations are in reaction to Russia's attack o Ukraine and therefore we hope that the situation on the ground progresses in a positive manner. That is, for Russia to understand that it cannot keep invading Ukrainian territory and engaging in war with Ukraine because the price it pays for it is too high", he added.

The second package of sanctions on Russi[https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/fac/2022/02/25/]a was approved on 25 February and the first sanction package[https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/fac/2022/02/21/] on 21 February.

Sberbank and VTB: the banks most affected by sanctions have ramifications as far as Angola and Vietnam (and a discreet connection to Portugal)

Sberbank and VTB: these are the names of the two largest Russian banks and the ones that are being targeted the most by international sanctions, as a response to Russia's military invasion of Ukraine. Its ramifications are extensive and are already leading to asset freezes outside Russian borders, reaching Angola and Vietnam.

"On a daily basis, Russian financial institutions conduct transactions in the foreign exchange market valued globally at $46 billion [something like €40 billion], 80 percent of which is in U.S. dollars." This is the justification given by the US Treasury for applying international sanctions on Russian banks, measures that have effectively cut them off from the Western financial market.

Together, the two largest Russian banks control half of the system: Sberbank's share of about 32% is added to the 17% held by VTB. The remaining banks are smaller: the third largest, Gazprombank, has 8%, up from 5% for Alfa, the first private bank on the list of Russian financial entities. The figures are in a recent presentation of another bank, the privately owned Sovcombank, also the target of some sanctions.

All of them are on the list of systemically important banks in Russia, along with other smaller ones.

Sberbank: the bank in intervention in the banking union Majority owned by the Government of the Russian Federation, Public Joint Stock Company Sberbank of Russia (Sberbank) is the largest bank in the country, accounting for one-third of all banking assets. It has the largest share of deposits and is the leading lender to the Russian economy. More than half of Russia's home loans are made at this financial institution, according to data from Sberbank Europe, its European arm.

It is this bank, founded in 1841, that is the main target of the international sanction: its correspondent bank status is eliminated, which limits any contact with the American banks that are its counterparts. Within a month, no transactions can be made with Sberbank, nor with its subsidiary financial institutions, from the USA.

Russian bank in the euro zone carries the same label as Banif and Popular: "at risk or insolvent. What is at stake?

The Russian giant has a presence in Eastern Europe, and its European units are under intervention by supervisory authorities - the deposit drain left them in a fragile situation this weekend. The European bank is headquartered in Austria, and then has subsidiaries in countries such as Croatia and Slovenia. All are under intervention by resolution authorities, with much of their movements frozen (and deposits limited). A decision that put a brake on the sale of the operations in Croatia and Slovenia that had been underway since late last year.

There are other Sberbank units in European countries, such as Ukraine and Belarus, as well as Cyprus (the financial sector company Arimero Holding Limited) and even Luxembourg (where the fund manager SB Securities is located). Besides that, it also has operations in the United Kingdom and the United States.

In Portugal, Sberbank Europa operates under the free provision of services regime, a kind of communitarian passport that is given to banks that operate in the European Union that trigger this authorization - it is normal in financial services to happen. In the case of the Austrian bank, the license is active, but there is no indication of business done in the country.

VTB: the shareholder group of a bank in Portugal Vietnam, Germany and Angola are geographies where VTB Bank, the second largest Russian bank that controls close to 20% of its assets, is located. It has majority state capital and the sanctions applied by the United States and allies freeze its assets, making it "inaccessible to the Kremlin," as indicated in the US Treasury statement. Names of VTB's leadership have been added to the list of European sanctions, which have been in place since Russia's deemed illegal annexation of Crimea.

This is the Russian bank that has a 12.2% shareholding position in Portugal's Banco Finantia, a position it has strengthened in recent years. It is an investor with a long presence in the niche bank. On its Strategic Council are three names linked to VTB.

In the US Treasury statement, there is no specific mention of minority stakes, such as the one the Russian bank has in Finantia. Only international positions are listed, such as the Angolan one, VTB Africa. This bank has a limited weight, having assets around 350 million euros.

Russian group shareholder of the Portuguese bank Finantia enters the list of sanctioned in the UK and USA

More banks targeted In the US statement, three other Russian financial institutions are announced to be blocked: Otkritie, Novikom, and Sovcombank.

Another state-owned bank, Otkritie ranks seventh in size in the Russian banking system. It has 12 subsidiary companies, such as an insurance company and a bank, not only in Russia but also in Cyprus. The state-owned Novikombank is smaller, but is on the list of the 50 largest banks. Its inclusion is due to its area of operation: the bank finances the defense sector.

Sovcombank is the third largest privately owned bank in Russia, and ninth in the ranking of banks. It has 22 financial services subsidiaries in Russia and Cyprus. Shareholder geographies include entities from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Japan, among others.

In Russia there are also European banks with significant presence: Raiffeisen Bank International and Unicredit are examples. The banks' shares sank this Monday. The Austrian bank slipped 14% in Vienna, while Unicredit dropped 9.5% in Milan. German banking entities also lost value due to exposure to companies with a presence in Eastern Europe, as told by Bloomberg.

Italy and France more exposed, Novo Banco with residual exposure According to Reuters, Italian, French and Austrian banks are the most exposed to the Russian economy.

In Portugal, Observador reported that national banks had no exposure. Novo Banco is the only one that has, including through Gazprom debt, denominated in euros - to Expresso, the bank declined to comment on the more than 10 million euros of investment that is attributed in the news.

Expresso contacted the Bank of Portugal last week, to understand the exposure of national entities to the Russian economy, but has not yet received a response.

Eurozone Military Union Is Worth Considering -- Market Talk

0650 GMT - ​A monetary, economic, fiscal and military ​eurozone ​union is a strategic objective worth considering​, Degroof Petercam Asset Management says. It would immediately solve the European Central Bank 's recurring problem related to fragmentation across eurozone government bond rates, it says. "As the euro announcement sparked the end of national currency speculation, taking an accelerated path towards fiscal and military cooperation would stifle rate speculation against Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece​," it says.​ (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

0649 GMT - Flight-to-quality government bonds will persist as long as the war in Ukraine rages on, says Peter de Coensel, chief executive of Degroof Petercam Asset Management, in a note. Rates at the longer end of yield curves for AAA-rated countries will receive sufficient interest, leaving them anchored around current levels, but if the war intensifies or spreads to other countries--such as Georgia or Moldavia--investors should expect a drop in long-term rates, he says. Inflation worries might take a back seat in markets, as the attention of participants will be directed toward sovereign, corporate and equity risks within their overall portfolio construction, he adds. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

0644 GMT - The geopolitical news flow adds to the volatility in fixed-income markets, which are already highly sensitive to inflation and monetary policy discussions, Julius Baer's analysts say. Bond "bears"--those expecting bond prices to fall and yields to rise--might argue that the crisis adds pressure to an already tight energy market and only reinforces the inflation problem, they say. Bond "bulls"--those expecting rising bond prices and falling yields--see risks to the economic outlook and, consequently, a slower path of monetary policy normalization, they add. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

0640 GMT - Julius Baer maintains its fixed-income strategy unchanged at this stage, but keeps the door open for adjustments, its analysts say. Accordingly, Julius Baer remains overweight in eurozone peripheral government bonds, assuming a more supportive European Central Bank in a worst-case scenario, while in credit, it maintains the call for moderate credit risk, they say. "Obviously, we will reassess the fixed income strategy as we gain clarity on the full set of economic sanctions imposed and the medium- to long-term economic impact," they say, referring to sanctions against Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

0603 GMT - USD/SGD is trading steadily in the Asian afternoon session, supported by safe-haven demand amid concerns over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. USD continues to trade firmly, implying haven flows are still quite substantial and heading into the USD and the U.S. bond market, Oanda says. Buying USD remains the easiest way to express concerns over the Russia-Ukraine war, and hence, despite the noise in equity and energy markets, currency markets are expected to continue reflecting those concerns, Oanda adds. USD/SGD is little changed at 1.3555. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)

0544 GMT - HKD may weaken more versus USD on a widening interest-rate spread between Hong Kong and the U.S. after Hong Kong's currency earlier touched a multi-month low of 7.8165 against the greenback, Mizuho Bank says. Under Hong Kong's Linked Exchange Rate System, the Fed's rate-increase cycle would lead to H.K./U.S. rate spread widening that would weaken HKD to 7.85 against USD, triggering HKMA FX intervention to defend HKD, Mizuho Bank adds. USD/HKD is little changed at 7.8155 after earlier touching 7.8167, its highest intraday level since December 2019, according to FactSet . (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)

0531 GMT - China is unlikely to roll out substantial further support measures and policies for its property sector, Citi says. The bank points out that recent top-level comments indicate that authorities will focus on policy continuity, which means no major additional support measures are likely to be introduced. Local governments might fine-tune their policies at the city level, but these actions would likely be insufficient to meaningfully improve buying sentiment or make consumers willing to accept non-discounted prices, Citi says. The limited new-housing supply may also limit officials' policy scope, as any major support measures could sharply raise housing prices, Citi adds. (yifan.wang@wsj.com)

0446 GMT - Sales in China's property sector weakened further in the January-February period, according to data from China Real Estate Information Corp . However, for the time being the declines are unlikely to prompt Beijing to begin a nationwide easing of policy restrictions it has imposed on the real-estate sector, Nomura economist Ting Lu says. China's top 100 developers reported a 43.4% on-year drop in home sales in terms of volume during the first two months of the year, compared with December's 30.9% decline. By value, sales dropped 43.1% on year in the year's first two months, compared with a 35.2% fall in December. Recent efforts by some local governments and banks to loosen restrictions on the sector might help, though they could further dent sentiment among potential home buyers, who may prefer to wait for further price declines before making a purchase, Lu writes in a note. (grace.zhu@dowjones.com)

0439 GMT - AUD/USD is slightly lower following comments from the RBA that war in Ukraine is a new source of uncertainty for policy makers. The currency pair dropped from 0.7260 to a low of 0.7247. However, that was arguably due to a stronger USD in Asian trading, says Westpac . The bank adds that it tends to view AUD/USD as being well supported by super-strong commodity prices, though likely capped for now by its 200-day moving average at 0.7330. Weakness is likely to develop ahead of the Fed's liftoff for interest rates, which is now less than three weeks away, it says. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0404 GMT - The RBA has declared the Ukraine war a new source of uncertainty for policy given that it further clouds the outlook for commodity prices and global inflation. Elsewhere in its monthly policy statement was a repeat of the central bank's established position that it wants to wait to see inflation become entrenched in its 2%-3% target band before raising interest rates. How the Ukraine war feeds into RBA policy calculations in coming months is anybody's guess, but it is likely to be felt directly through commodity prices. Still, the war is a further complication for the RBA , which is already dealing with the pandemic and rising price pressures internationally. (james.glynn@wsj.com; @JamesGlynnWSJ)

0301 GMT - Russia's involvement in the G-20 must be reviewed, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison tells reporters. Asked whether he'd like Russia to be ejected from the G-20, Morrison says it is a "sensitive" but "very real" issue. "They are issues we are working through with Indonesia who have the G-20 chair this year," he says. "The G-20 has a lot of members and that's a lot of interest to manage, and we want to support Indonesia in successfully chairing the G-20 this year, but I think there has been a very clear view expressed particularly by countries like Australia, G-7 countries: this will need to be managed." Russia has "self-selected themselves as a pariah state," he says. "No one should have anything to do with them, frankly, right around the world." (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle)

0233 GMT - The economic impact of the Russian and Ukraine conflict on China should be limited and indirect, Citigroup economists say. The conflict could, at most, push up China's PPI and CPI by 1.2 percentage points and 0.3 percentage points respectively in 2022, they say. Chinese companies and financial institutions doing business with Russia, however, are exposed to higher sanction-related risks. Technology-related trade between Russia and China will likely continue to attract heightened U.S. and European scrutiny and more Chinese entities may proactively limit their transactions with Russian companies, the economists say.(singaporeeditors@dowjones.com)

Declaração conjunta das tutelas do Desporto relativamente à invasão da Ucrânia pela Rússia

STATEMENT ON RUSSIA'S WAR ON UKRAINE & INTERNATIONAL SPORT

Russia's unprovoked and unjustifiable war of choice against Ukraine, enabled by the Belarusian government, is abhorrent and a flagrant breach of its international obligations. Respect for human rights and peaceful relations between nations form the foundation of international sport.

We, as a collective of like-minded nations, affirm our support for international sport organisations' position that:

* Russia and Belarus should not be permitted to host, bid for or be awarded any international sporting events.

* Individual athletes selected by Russia and Belarus, administrators and teams representing the Russian or Belarusian state should be banned from competing in other countries, including those representing bodies, cities or brands that are effectively representing Russia or Belarus, such as major football clubs .

* Wherever possible, appropriate actions should be taken to limit sponsorship and other financial support from entities with links to the Russian or Belarusian states.

We call on all international sport federations to endorse these principles and applaud all those that have done so already. We also welcome the International Paralympic Committee's decision to prevent Russia's and Belarus' athletes from competing in the 2022 Winter Paralympics in Beijing. These restrictions should be in place until cooperation under the fundamental principles of international law has become possible again.

We encourage all international sport organisations and all relevant legal bodies not to sanction athletes, coaches or officials who decide unilaterally to terminate their contracts with Russian, Belarusian or Ukrainian clubs, as well as not to pursue or to sanction sport organisers which decide to ban athletes or teams selected by Russia or Belarus.

Furthermore, we encourage the international sport community to continue to show its solidarity with the people of Ukraine, including through supporting the continuation of Ukrainian sport where possible.

Declaração sobre a Guerra da Rússia na Ucrânia e Desporto Internacional

A guerra intencional, não provocada e injustificável da Rússia contra a Ucrânia, permitida pelo governo bielorrusso, é abominável e uma violação flagrante das suas obrigações internacionais. O respeito pelos direitos humanos e as relações pacíficas entre as nações formam a base do desporto internacional.

Nós, como um coletivo de nações que partilham a mesma opinião, afirmamos o nosso apoio às organizações desportivas internacionais relativamente ao abaixo:

* A Rússia e a Bielorrússia não devem ser autorizadas a acolher, a candidatar-se ou a ser-lhes concedida a organização de qualquer evento desportivo internacional.

* Os atletas individuais selecionados pela Rússia e Bielorrússia, administradores e equipas que representam os Estados russo ou bielorusso devem ser proibidos de competirem noutros

países. Isto inclui aqueles que representam organismos, cidades, ou marcas que representam efetivamente a Rússia ou a Bielorrússia, tais como grandes clubes de futebol.

* Sempre que possível, devem ser tomadas medidas apropriadas para limitar o patrocínio e outros apoios financeiros de entidades com ligações aos Estados russo ou bielorrusso.

Apelamos a todas as federações desportivas internacionais que adotem estes princípios e aplaudimos todas aquelas que já o fizeram. Saudamos igualmente a decisão do Comité Paralímpico Internacional de impedir que os atletas russos e bielorrussos compitam nos Jogos Paralímpicos de Inverno de 2022 em Pequim. Estas restrições devem ser aplicadas até que a cooperação ao abrigo dos princípios fundamentais do direito internacional se torne novamente possível.

Encorajamos todas as organizações desportivas internacionais e todos os organismos legais relevantes a não sancionarem atletas, treinadores ou oficiais que decidam rescindir unilateralmente os seus contratos com clubes russos, bielorussos ou ucranianos, bem como a não perseguirem ou sancionarem organizadores desportivos que decidam banir atletas ou equipas selecionadas pela Rússia ou Bielorrússia.

Além disso, encorajamos a comunidade desportiva internacional a continuar a mostrar a sua solidariedade para com o povo da Ucrânia, inclusivamente apoiando a continuação do desporto ucraniano sempre que possível.

Portugal says question of Abramovich citizenship depends on inquiry

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal said on Thursday it would not strip the citizenship of Chelsea soccer club owner Roman Abramovich for now because that measure was not part of EU sanctions against Russian oligarchs, but his nationality status could change depending on the outcome of an inquiry.

Britain on Thursday imposed sanctions on the 55-year-old, who has Israeli and Portuguese citizenship, in an escalation of measures against associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin after the Kremlin's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

In a statement sent to Reuters, the Portuguese justice ministry said sanctions imposed by Britain on Russian-born Abramovich did not apply outside the United Kingdom due to its exit from the European Union.

The bloc, of which Portugal is a member, has blacklisted a number of Russian oligarchs but an EU spokesperson for foreign affairs said it could only apply sanctions to third country nationals or entities, and not to its own citizens.

"The EU cannot sanction its own citizens and entities – they are being 'punished' within the existing legal framework in the EU," the spokesperson said, without explaining what the "existing legal framework" allowed.

But there are examples of times when the EU sanctioned its own citizens, said law researcher Miguel Delgado.

In 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, a European Council regulation said restrictive measures could be applied to EU nationals. In 2012, the bloc banned the London-born wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from travelling to the EU.

Abramovich was granted Portuguese citizenship in April 2021 based on a law offering naturalisation to descendants of Sephardic Jews who were expelled from the Iberian peninsula during the mediaeval Inquisition.

There is little known history of Sephardic Jews in Russia, although Abramovich is a common surname of Ashkenazi Jewish origin.

The Portuguese prosecutor's office in January opened an investigation into the granting of citizenship to Abramovich.. On Thursday, a Portuguese government source told Reuters Abramovich's citizenship could be stripped depending on the outcome of the inquiry.

A spokesperson for Abramovich did not reply to a request for comment.

Joao Paulo Batalha, an anti-corruption expert and vice president of Civic Front, an association that denounces wrongdoing in public life, told Reuters the Portuguese government should implement measures of its own, whether or not the EU ends up adding Abramovich to its list of sanctioned oligarchs.

"This obtuse response from the Portuguese government indicates a blatant negligence ... with Abramovich's obscure interests," Batalha said.

He said Abramovich's citizenship should not be removed due to the sanctions but due to the "many indications of fraud associated with the certification process of alleged Sephardic descendants".

Batalha as well as other activists, commentators and politicians have repeatedly said the law offering naturalisation to descendants of Sephardic Jews must be reviewed as they believe it is being used by oligarchs to get a foothold in the EU.

Applicants' genealogies are vetted by experts at one of Portugal's Jewish centres, Lisbon or Porto. The Porto centre was responsible for Abramovich's process. They have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

"It is obvious that a person's citizenship cannot be withdrawn just like that ... that's why citizenship ... is so desirable and sought after by oligarchs. It provides a high level of protection," said Susana Coroado, president of the Portuguese branch of Transparency International. "But that's also why it can't be 'sold'."

Portugal: CPI inflation accelerates 85bps to 4.19% y/y in February

Broad-based acceleration, food, transport, housing prices all rise at a faster pace

We expect inflation to continue accelerating throughout H1 due to the war in Ukraine

CPI inflation accelerated to 4.19% y/y in February, up from 3.34% y/y in January, according to the latest data released by ELSTAT on Thursday. The acceleration was broad-based, with food, transport and housing prices all rising at a faster pace in February. Prices of foods and non-alcoholic beverages rose by 4.67% y/y in February, up from 3.71% y/y inflation in January. Transport prices increased by 8.5% y/y in February, compared to 6.24% y/y in the previous month, while housing and utilities prices rose by 5.05% y/y in February, up from 4.51% y/y in January. This is the strongest inflation in housing and utilities prices since 2012.

The alternative breakdown showed that core CPI (excluding unprocessed food and energy) rose by 3.18% y/y in February, accelerating from 2.45% y/y in January. Unprocessed food prices themselves rose by 3.74% y/y in February, accelerating from 3.38% y/y in January, while energy price inflation accelerated to 14.98% y/y in February, up from 12.15% y/y in the previous month. On an alternative basis, CPI inflation accelerated to 0.4% m/m in February, up from 0.3% m/m in January.

Looking forward, we expect CPI inflation to continue steadily accelerating in the next months, at least throughout H1. The war in Ukraine and subsequent sanction on Russia have caused enormous chaos in commodities markets and global trade of many key commodities are being disrupted, including agricultural commodities and fertilizers. We expect inflation to not only accelerate, but become more broad-based in the coming months.

Portuguese authorities have arrested a leading Rabbi and banned him from leaving the country, amid an investigation into the decision to give sanctioned Russian billionaire, Roman Abramovich, Portuguese citizenship, based on his supposed links to the country’s Jewish community.

Police arrested Porto Rabbi Daniel Litvak in Portugal’s second largest city, amid claims he issued the documents that allowed Abramovich to claim Portuguese citizenship, on the grounds that the Russian billionaire is a descendant of Sephardic Jews that were expelled from the country during the Inquisition.

The Rabbi’s arrest comes after Portuguese police launched a series of raids on Friday, as part of investigation into money laundering, corruption, and falsification of documents.

Portuguese authorities have now banned Litvak from leaving Portugal, amid claims Litvak was preparing to travel to Israel at the time of his arrest.

The investigation comes after Portuguese authorities on Thursday said the UK’s sanctions against Roman Abramovich would not be enforced in Portugal, as they claimed the EU is unable to sanction its own citizens.

Abramovich was granted Portuguese citizenship in April 2021, through a 2015 law that allows the descendants of Sephardic Jews, who were expelled from the Iberian Peninsula in the 15th century, to claim Portuguese citizenship.

Almost 57,000 people have been issued Portuguese citizenship through the naturalization laws, since they were first introduced seven years ago.

In order for citizenship applications to be granted, claims of Sephardic heritage must be approved by authorities in either of Portugal’s two Jewish Centres, which are based in the country’s two major cities, Porto and Lisbon. Litvak is a Rabbi at the country’s Porto Jewish Centre.

The arrest comes as Abramovich has previously faced suspicions over his claims to have Sephardic ancestry, due to the fact that Sephardic Jews have historically had few links to Russia.

The surname Abramovich is also most common amongst Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern European countries. Abramovich also has Russian and Israeli citizenship.

EPL bans Abramovich running Chelsea, hastening need for sale

In an unprecedented ruling against a club owner, the Premier League ordered Roman Abramovich on Saturday to stop running Chelsea and sell up after he was sanctioned by the British government over Russia’s war on Ukraine and his close links to President Vladimir Putin.

The league board’s decision to disqualify Abramovich from being a director accelerates the end of the Russian oligarch’s 19 years in control of the reigning world and European champions but the club that transformed into a perennial trophy winner by his investment is allowed to play on.

League regulations would usually require Abramovich to relinquish control within 28 days but the British government now has a say in the sale process under the terms of the license that allows the team to continue operating despite the owner's assets being frozen.

The government welcomed the Premier League's move against Abramovich, characterizing the disqualification as being part of holding “those who have enabled the Putin regime” to account.

“We are open to a sale of the club and would consider an application for a license to allow that to happen,” the government said.

The government now has oversight of the buyout process which the Raine Group, an investment bank, has been working on since Abramovich last week announced, before being sanctioned, that the club was up for sale.

One consortium weighing a bid features Todd Boehly, part owner of the MLB's Los Angeles Dodgers, Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and Jonathan Goldstein, a London-based property investor who is CEO of Cain International.

There was another financial hit to Chelsea[https://apnews.com/d39a7b3dda4655fc9ca0df15522b1212] on Saturday when jersey sleeve sponsor Hyundai suspended its marketing with the club until further notice and asked for its logo to be removed. It follows main jersey backer Three, the communications firm, also suspending its partnership. But jersey maker Nike is standing by Chelsea ahead of a potential takeover.

Abramovich originally hoped to divert the proceeds of a sale into a new foundation for the victims of the war in Ukraine, which he is yet to condemn Putin for launching. But the government will only sanction a sale that does not see Abramovich benefit as the government tightens the screw on influential individuals it views as enabling Putin’s regime.

The government did on Saturday ease one of the terms of the license restricting Chelsea's finances, raising the cap on matchday spending to run Stamford Bridge from 500,000 pounds to 900,000 pounds ($1.2 million) ahead of Sunday's Premier League game against Newcastle.

Chelsea had company credit cards from Barclaycard frozen as a result of the sanctions.

After disqualifying Abramovich, the Premier League confirmed that “the board’s decision does not impact on the club’s ability to train and play its fixtures.”

Some Chelsea fans have continued to stand by Abramovich during the opening two weeks of the war, even chanting his name at a game last weekend that the league hoped to use to show solidarity to Ukraine and the victims of Russia’s invasion.

Abramovich’s disqualification halts the reign of the competition’s first billionaire foreign owner, whose fortune turned Chelsea into one of the biggest-spending clubs in Europe and one of the game’s most successful. His investment ended Chelsea’s 50-year domestic title drought when the league was won in 2005 and the trophy has been collected another four times.

The team has collected 21 trophies since 2004 thanks to spending on players that has seen Abramovich inject more than 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) into Chelsea through loans he said he will not ask to be repaid.

Sanctions were imposed against Abramovich after the government called him a “pro-Kremlin oligarch” linked to “destabilizing ... undermining and threatening” Ukraine where the war is into a third week. Abramovich has made no comment since being sanctioned.

Abramovich has been without a British visa since 2018 when he withdrew an application to renew his visa amid a clampdown on rich Russians after a former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned in the English city of Salisbury.

Abramovich has since gained citizenship in both Israel and Portugal. But there are investigations in Portugal into how Abramovich was naturalized as a citizen based on receiving confirmation he is a descendant of Sephardic Jews. A rabbi in the city has been detained, police said Saturday, without confirming local media reports about him being questioned in relation to Abramovich gaining Portuguese nationality.

ARCHAEOLOGISTS are set to rewrite the history books after they uncovered new evidence that suggests the oldest instances of mummification occurred 8,000 years ago.

Researchers have taken a second look at photographs snapped 60 years ago of several skeletons that were buried in southern Portugal. A new analysis of these photos has led them to believe that the oldest evidence of mummification actually originated in Europe, not Egypt or Chile as previously thought. During excavations in the 1960s, archaeologists discovered nearly a dozen ancient bodies in Portugal's Sado Valley.

Analysing previously undeveloped photos, researchers now believe that at least one of those bodies had been mummified.

They theorise that this was done to possibly make it easier to transport before its burial.

Experts also found evidence that suggests that other bodies that were buried at the site may have been similarly preserved as mummies, implying that this was a widespread practice in the region.

Mummification is most commonly associated with Ancient Egypt, where elaborate burial procedures were used more than 4,500 years ago.

Other evidence of mummification outside Egypt is found in other parts of Europe, dating from about 1000 BC.

However, archaeologists have now dated this person as the oldest mummy ever discovered, predating all previous instances by a long time.

This newly identified mummy in Portugal pushes back the previous record by about 1,000 years, then held by mummies found in the coastal region of Chile's Atacama Desert.

When it comes to hot and dry regions like Egypt and the Atacama desert, mummification is a relatively straightforward process.

However, it is generally difficult to find evidence of mummies in Europe, where much wetter conditions mean that mummified soft tissues rarely stay preserved, according to Rita Peyroteo-Stjerna, a bioarchaeologist at Uppsala University in Sweden.

Speaking to Live Science, Ms Peyroteo-Stjerna, the lead author of the study said: "It's very hard to make these observations, but it's possible with combined methods and experimental work."

Other authors of the study added: “These burials generally conform to the pattern characteristic of the mortuary practices known for these hunter-gatherer communities, but aspects of the treatment of the body, including its transformation and curation before burial, are new elements.

“New insights into the use of burial places, such as a very tight clustering of burials, and the proposed cases of mummification and the subsequent internment of hyperflexed, intact bodies highlight the significance of both the body and the burial place in the wider hunter-gatherer landscape of south-western Portugal.”

After observing the photographs, the archaeologists noted that the bones of the buried skeletons were “hyperflexed”, meaning that their limbs have been bent far beyond their natural limits.

This indicates that after the person’s death, the body had been tied up with bindings that have disintegrated since then.

The team also found that the bones of the skeleton were in excellent condition, particularly the small bones of the feet, which generally fall apart completely from the skeleton as the body decomposes.

The SWIFT blockade, one of the strongest financial sanctions applied to Russia, has caused the movement of Russian funds through Portuguese banks to plummet. Before the application of the measure, passed through the Portuguese banks about two million euros. With the sanction, they now total 700,000 euros, according to Negócios.Since the beginning of the year and until February 24, 79 million euros were moved in Portugal via Russian banks, about 0.03% of the total. This amount is equivalent to about two million euros a day. This week, after the introduction of the SWIFT blockade, which applied to seven Russian banks (and seven branches), these movements were reduced to 700 thousand euros. The temporary suspension will be extended to three Belarusian banks as of next Monday.(News corrected at 12:23 pm)

Oligarch Abramovich Races To Outpace Sanctions --- Billionaire with Putin ties seeks to move wealth as dragnet expands

For years, Roman Abramovich braced for the day the West might turn on him.

As a Russian billionaire with a history intertwined with President Vladimir Putin, he and dozens of businesspeople like him have lived under the threat of sanctions by Western governments as relations with Moscow deteriorated.

When they finally came this month, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the penalties were on a scale that he hadn't expected, according to people familiar with the matter. They have triggered a game of cat-and-mouse, with the 55-year-old rushing to move chunks of his wealth out of reach of a rapidly expanding dragnet for his assets.

The U.K., the European Union, Canada and Australia have subjected him to travel restrictions and have frozen his assets in those jurisdictions. U.S. officials, too, are readying sanctions against Mr. Abramovich, according to people familiar with the matter, but the timing remains uncertain, and Washington may ultimately decide not to target him.

London and Brussels accuse him of benefiting from close ties to Mr. Putin. By punishing Russia's business elite, Western governments aim to apply further pressure on Moscow to alter course in Ukraine.

In recent weeks, Mr. Abramovich has tried to sell some U.S.-based funds. He put his trophy asset, London soccer club Chelsea FC, up for sale, and did the same with a 15-bedroom London mansion. An investment vehicle for technology startups and renewable-energy ventures, long controlled by Mr. Abramovich via a series of trusts, was moved into the ownership of a business associate hours after the invasion started, according to filings.

Mr. Abramovich made a fortune in the oil business during Russia's lurch from communism to capitalism. His asset purchases and his philanthropy earned him warm welcomes in Western capitals. In the U.K., he pumped money into Chelsea, turning it into a championship club and earning him near-celebrity status in London.

"He tried to dissociate from Russia," said Andrey Movchan, a former Russian banking executive and director of the Economic Policy Program at the think tank Carnegie Moscow Center, who had business dealings with Mr. Abramovich. "I don't think he or anyone else expected what would come."

In the immediate wake of the invasion, Mr. Abramovich's representatives said, he was involved in trying to help peace efforts between Ukraine and Russia. As public opinion, especially in the U.K., turned against him, it became clear he couldn't hang onto his most prized assets, said one person close to him.

He largely disappeared from public view until Monday, when he was photographed sitting in an airport lounge in Israel, masked, scrolling on his phone and waiting to board a private jet that eventually landed in Moscow.

Many of the houses and yachts acquired during his spending spree are now at risk of being caught up in a net in which governments can freeze assets indefinitely, without having to prove criminality or other wrongdoing. He can challenge those freezes in most cases, but that could prompt years of legal wrangling.

For now, Mr. Abramovich won't be entitled to proceeds from any sale of the soccer team, the U.K. government has said. Some of his funds have been frozen in the U.S., pending guidance from the U.K. on its sanctions. British restrictions are so detailed that he is unable to pay ground rent he owes to the Crown Estate, which manages properties owned by the Queen, for his London mansion.

His two yachts recently set sail from waters that could have been subject to sanctions. Other oligarch's vessels were impounded in France and Italy. A leading Portuguese rabbi who helped Mr. Abramovich obtain Portuguese citizenship in 2021 was arrested as part of a wider investigation in Portugal involving alleged influence-peddling, forgery, money laundering and tax fraud, according to people familiar with the case.

Mr. Abramovich had paid $36.4 million in 2008 for a mansion near Aspen, Colo. Earlier this week, a commissioner for Pitkin County, Greg Poschman, said he wrote to state and federal officials urging action to avoid any liquidation or transfers of assets involving Mr. Abramovich's homes there.

It took weeks for the U.K. and the EU to sanction Mr. Abramovich. The British government held off in part because it worried that he would contest the designation with a lawsuit, according to U.K. officials.

Even though the U.K. has sanctioned Mr. Abramovich, U.S. officials have been wary of doing so because of his minority stake in steel company Evraz PLC, according to one person familiar with the matter. Federal officials, the person said, worry that a clampdown on Mr. Abramovich could disrupt that business, possibly affecting global steel prices as well as workers at plants the company owns in Oregon and Colorado. In the U.K., Evraz hasn't been sanctioned.

Officials across the West are trying to figure out what the tycoon owns and to ensure he doesn't sell it. The British government estimates Mr. Abramovich's wealth is around $12.3 billion. His known properties include a French chateau in Cap d'Antibes and numerous London properties, according to corporate and property filings. Notable art includes Francis Bacon's "Triptych, 1976," which he bought for $86.3 million, and Lucian Freud's "Benefits Supervisor Sleeping," purchased for $33.6 million. He owns a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, which is currently in Dubai.

For years, Mr. Abramovich kept a relatively low profile in the West. When he arrived in London to purchase Chelsea in 2003, the club's then-owners had to Google who he was, according to people who were present.

A 2012 ruling by a British court in a lawsuit filed against Mr. Abramovich summarized the major events of his life. The suit was brought by a former business partner, Boris Berezovsky.

His parents died when he was a small child, and he was brought up by relatives in a remote part of Russia. He quit college and took a job as a welder. When the fading Soviet Union began to allow private enterprise, he started a small business making plastic toys, including rubber ducks. By the early 1990s, as the old Soviet economy crumbled, he had become a successful oil trader.

His big break came in 1994, during a yachting holiday in the Caribbean, when he met Mr. Berezovsky, a Russian tycoon 20 years his senior. He successfully pitched Mr. Berezovsky on a plan to merge two oil businesses. Mr. Berezovsky, a businessman with ties to former President Boris Yeltsin, offered him the political cover to push such a deal through. The resulting oil company was called Sibneft.

In the U.K. lawsuit, Mr. Berezovsky, who fled Russia after falling out with Mr. Putin, accused Mr. Abramovich of later bullying him into selling a stake in Sibneft for much less than its true value.

The court concluded that the deal between Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Abramovich was "inherently corrupt," a description accepted by Mr. Abramovich's lawyer during a court hearing in 2011. That lawyer argued that was how business was done in Russia at the time. After the London high court ruled against Mr. Berezovsky, he was found dead in a house in England in an apparent suicide.

Sibneft was later privatized in a deal that cemented Mr. Abramovich's status as a billionaire. He went on to help found United Co. Rusal, one of the world's biggest aluminum groups.

After Mr. Putin became president in 2000, he initially turned the screw on the oligarch class, jailing some of the country's richest men. Mr. Abramovich was spared. Around that time, Mr. Abramovich became the governor of a frozen chunk of Arctic called Chukotka. He began pumping in millions of dollars to help transform the desolate region.

"I started business early, so maybe that's why I'm bored with it," Mr. Abramovich told The Wall Street Journal at the time.

He started investing around the world, including in art. In 2005, he sold a 73% stake in Sibneft to state-owned gas titan Gazprom for more than $13 billion. In 2006, he bought a minority holding in the steel group Evraz. He also has a stake in Norilsk Nickel.

In the early 2000s, he began spending more time in London. When he bought Chelsea, the BBC asked him why he decided to sink more than $100 million into a soccer team. "Yes, I know what people say," he replied. "But there are lots of rich, young people in Russia. We don't live that long, so we earn it and spend it."

In 2018, U.K.-Russia relations deteriorated following the poisoning in England of a former Russian spy. The U.K. didn't renew Mr. Abramovich's visa. That led him to cancel plans to spend more than $1 billion building Chelsea a new stadium in the heart of London.

That same year, he became a citizen of Israel. Before the invasion of Ukraine, several representatives of leading Israeli cultural, academic and medical institutions signed a letter to the U.S. ambassador in Israel warning of the financial consequences of sanctioning Mr. Abramovich, a major donor to Israel's Yad Vashem holocaust memorial.

On the day Russia invaded Ukraine, some British lawmakers wanted to know why Mr. Abramovich wasn't among the first Russians sanctioned by the U.K. That same day, control of British Virgin Islands-registered Norma Investments Ltd., an investment vehicle that corporate disclosures indicate Mr. Abramovich had previously controlled, shifted to David Davidovich, a close business associate.

Two days later, Mr. Abramovich said he was transferring "stewardship and care" of Chelsea to the trustees of the team's charitable foundation. The club, however, wasn't for sale, and he remained the owner.

As the clamor by British lawmakers grew louder, Mr. Abramovich put the club on the market and said the proceeds would go to charity.

"I hope that I will be able to visit Stamford Bridge one last time to say goodbye to all of you in person," Mr. Abramovich wrote to Chelsea fans when he put the club up for sale. A few days later, he was banned from traveling to the U.K.

Effects of the war: fewer factories producing, more expensive products and less income to buy them

Household disposable income is going down, businesses are going to have trouble getting products (and may even have to stop), trade between countries is limited, and above all, there is uncertainty. These are the four channels of impact of the war being waged in Ukraine by Russia, intensified by the consequences of economic sanctions.

The scenario is outlined by the deputy director of the research department of the Bank of Portugal, João Amador, in a conversation in the podcast made by the banking authority itself and that was released following the release of the Economic Bulletin, when it lowered the growth projection from 5.8% to 4.9% in 2022, with a reduction also foreseen for the following year.

Increase in imported raw materialsThe first channel has to do with the increase in the price of raw materials that Portugal imports, such as energy sources (oil and gas) or cereals. "We have producers facing higher production costs and they will demand higher prices per unit produced," he summarizes. It has already been happening and it is a new pressure placed when there were already sectors under pressure - it already happened, for example, with paper prices, which led producers to raise prices. As a result, there is a "fall in the purchasing power" of the Portuguese.

"When we have these two forces, in the end we have higher prices and lower quantities produced and consumed, and less income," summarizes João Amador in the podcast.

Disturbances in productionThe second channel mentioned by the deputy director of Banco de Portugal is "direct production disruptions", such as transportation difficulties and supply stoppages. Again, the pandemic had already raised these problems, so now there is a worsening of the situation.

The case of the chips for electronics is one of the examples given by the responsible. There are "elements for the production of chips incorporated in electronic devices, supplied from Ukraine", and "a stoppage could have consequences in the entire electronics industry".

"However, the adaptability of companies - already demonstrated during the pandemic - mitigates the impact of this type of shock in the medium term," is what the supervisor says in the Economic Bulletin that was released.

TradeAll these problems have implications for trade between countries. Directly, there is not much connection between Portugal and Russia and Ukraine, the two economies most exposed to the war. The two countries account for 0.4% of national exports and 2% of imports of goods, according to data from 2015 to 2019. But the world is interconnected.

"It's limited, but there are many countries that we trade with a lot that are most affected. The indirect effects, in terms of external demand directed to Portugal, things can be more significant," continues the head of the supervisor.

The uncertaintyFinally, in the estimates of the authority headed by Mário Centeno, there is a fourth impact channel: there is uncertainty and there is an impact on financial markets. Pessimism postpones household consumption decisions and postpones investment decisions by companies. This paralyzes the economy.

Contributing to this whole "adverse" scenario are also the consequences of sanctions, adds Banco de Portugal economist Gabriela Castro. There are "consumers and large companies more resistant to buying raw materials that come from Russia," given the sanctions imposed in certain areas (even though exposure to the country is limited), but there is a problem: "retaliation. A "possible Russian sanction on energy supplies" would have major consequences in the Eurozone and, of course, in Portugal, said the economist in the same podcast.

The Rotten Saga of Roman Abramovich’s 'Sephardic' Citizenship, and Its Repercussions

In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s close circle of oligarchs and allies have come under renewed scrutiny, not to mention sanctions.

One of them is Russian Jewish billionaire Roman Abramovich[https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/u-k-adds-putin-ally-and-chelsea-soccer-club-owner-abramovich-to-sanctions-list-1.10665952], who was sanctioned by Britain in March 2022, his assets in the country frozen and forced to relinquish ownership of Chelsea Football Club. The UK also tightened visa requirements for him and others on the sanctions list.

But that was less of a worry for Abramovich[https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-abramovich-attends-russia-ukraine-peace-talks-in-istanbul-1.10705775] who, in addition to holding Russian and Israeli[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.HIGHLIGHT-u-s-growing-alarmed-over-israel-s-safe-harbor-for-russian-oligarchs-1.10672052] passports[https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-is-putin-s-pet-oligarch-abramovich-worthy-of-israeli-citizenship-1.6136441], is also a citizen of Portugal. And it is this European Union passport that has now attracted considerable attention, if not consternation. It has, so far, led to the start of an official government inquiry, the detainment of a chief rabbi, the relinquishing of the Porto Jewish Community from its role in the citizenship acquisition process, and an amendment to Portugal’s citizenship law.

Spain[https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-spain-1.5606838] and Portugal’s Sephardic ancestry laws, passed in 2015, under whose auspices Abramovich attained a Portuguese passport, were supposed to "right a historic wrong": The Expulsions of 1492[https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-1492-spain-turns-on-the-jews-1.5236303] and 1496 that displaced tens of thousands of Jews from Iberia. Their descendants, the Sephardim, initially settled mainly in Morocco and the Ottoman Empire, as well the Americas (often as crypto-Jews).

Portugal finally abolished the Inquisition, tasked with investigating alleged heretics, often crypto-Jews, in 1821; its last auto-da-fé ("act of faith," a public penance for accused apostates or heretics) was held in Lisbon in 1739. In 1826, there was a last Spanish auto-da-fé in Valencia, in which one Jew was burned alive[https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2155-auto-da-fe]. Spain's decree of expulsion was only formally revoked in[https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-this-day-spain-lifts-the-expulsion-1.5377424] 1968. Five centuries later, both countries' laws, sometimes framed as a 'Law of Return,' granted citizenship to anyone proving descent from Jews expelled from Iberia.

Despite this stated goal, I found in my master’s research at McGill University, conducted in 2021, that Sephardic Jews[https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-sephardic-1.5599044] applying for citizenship are driven less by a deep-seated interest in the historic reconciliation touted by Spain and Portugal, and far more by practical needs such as global mobility.

Many applied first to Spain[https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/.premium-130-000-descendants-of-jews-expelled-from-spain-file-citizenship-applications-1.7925157], but when it then required language and citizenship tests, thousands flocked to Portugal. Spain shut down its process in October 2019 as scheduled, following a year-long extension. An unknown number (likely hundreds) received citizenship from both countries, again indicating the lack of specific emotional attachment to either state.

Many applicants arrived at the process with the understanding that not all passports are created equal, and for Sephardic Jews from all over the world, and especially those from Israel[https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-israelis-prepare-for-a-new-spanish-inquisition-1.5373098], Turkey[https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-portuguese-citizenship-law-attracts-250-jewish-applicants-1.5373866] and Venezuela[https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/why-is-spain-suddenly-turning-down-so-many-jews-who-apply-for-citizenship-1.10147691], the value of an EU passport could not be overstated. Holders of EU citizenship can live or work anywhere in the 28-nation union, and can apply for citizenship for immediate family members.

It is not surprising that someone like the oligarch Roman Abramovich would try to game this system. EU citizenship and its associated residence rights would be to his benefit as well: He only needed to find a single Sephardic ancestor. And if he couldn’t put his finger on that family member, he could persuade an authorized body to attest to the existence of such an ancestor[https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/.premium-ashkenazi-jews-find-spanish-portuguese-roots-after-passport-offer-to-descendants-1.8024821]. Despite being a Russian Jew with no publicly known Sephardic connection, Abramovich was approved for Portuguese citizenship in April 2021.

The Portuguese law outsourced the job of approving applicants’ Sephardic heritage to the Jewish communities of Porto and Lisbon. Abramovich’s application, along with almost 90 percent of applicants, was approved by the Porto Jewish Community and signed by the community’s chief rabbi, Daniel Litvak[https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/jewish-community-in-portugal-revives-after-new-citizenship-law-1.5403829].

The Spanish law had empowered local notaries to perform the task of authenticating documents and approving applications. The Federation of Jewish Communities of Spain sold certificates to applicants online with no checks of any kind and was able to create a lucrative new revenue stream for itself out of thin air. By contrast, the Portuguese communities were much more intimately involved.

The inquiry into the Abramovich case began before the Russian invasion of Ukraine; it was announced in January 2022. Kremlin-aligned oligarchs like Abramovich own properties, dock yachts, and stash their immense wealth all over the EU. Holding EU citizenship would simplify many of these acquisition and investment processes. As Western governments began to sanction oligarchs and freeze their assets, Portuguese public interest in the ongoing inquiry intensified.

It was in this new climate, on March 12th, that the rabbi who approved the applications, Daniel Litvak, was detained[https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/portuguese-officers-detain-rabbi-accused-of-helping-russian-billionaire-abramovich-1.10669554] as he headed to Israel. His passport was confiscated, and the investigation is still underway.

We still do not know the specifics of the Abramovich case. The Porto community denies the charges of corruption and even compared the investigation to the Inquisition[https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/.premium-inquisition-portuguese-rabbi-s-arrest-for-aiding-abramovich-angers-porto-s-jews-1.10675886]. We do know there is a large reservoir of goodwill for Russian oligarchs in Jewish communal circles around the globe. Abramovich and other Russian Jewish oligarchs have earned the trust of mainstream Jewish institutions by becoming major donors[https://jewishcurrents.org/our-oligarch].

But the "benevolent philanthropist[https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/.premium.HIGHLIGHT.MAGAZINE-abramovich-became-a-portuguese-citizen-in-half-a-year-authorities-want-to-know-how-1.10676027]" image they cultivate is not accidental. And it is this cloak of respectability and generosity that might have moved the levers for Abramovich in Portugal.

In light of the escalating debacle, the Porto community has suspended its collaboration with the government as arbiters of Jewish applicants’ Sephardic authenticity. Considering the increased attention from the government and the public, the Lisbon community is unlikely to fill the void. It is now unclear how the process will continue to function. Will a government authority now be charged with determining who is of genuine Sephardic descent?

Already there are controversies with how the laws – both in Spain and in Portugal – have functioned. The laws go by an entirely ‘biological’ understanding of Sephardic identity: direct blood ancestry is the only way to qualify. That meant the many Jews of other origins and converts that integrated into Sephardic Jewish communities, such as the Mizrahi Jews[https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-mizrahi-1.5599313] integrated into the Istanbul community, are technically not eligible. However, in practice I found that these acculturated Sephardim did get approved for citizenship.

The other issue with basing restitution on direct bloodline descent is the fact that it goes back to a period before modern recordkeeping. It is extremely difficult for an individual to locate a paper trail to certify the fact that their great-great-great-great (and another few greats) parent was a Jew from Iberia.

And you only need a single one; as far back as you need to go to find one. That opens up the process to issues of trust. For members of established Sephardic congregations, this is easy enough: Their institution is trusted to certify their membership.

But for cases like the thousands of Latin Americans claiming crypto-Jewish[https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-the-inquisition-reaches-mexico-1.5323893] heritage, the Donme[https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/once-a-jewish-sect-turkey-s-secretive-dnme-inspire-conspiracy-and-persecution-1.5422262] of Turkey (whose ancestors converted to Islam following the false messiah Shabbetai Tzvi[https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/.premium.HIGHLIGHT.MAGAZINE-in-search-of-sabbatai-zevi-the-self-styled-messiah-who-led-a-crypto-jewish-sect-1.9453114] ) or opportunists like Abramovich, someone must be nominated as the arbiter. Placing local Jewish communities in this position saves the Portuguese government from the uncomfortable role of determining who is or is not Sephardic enough. It also has the practical benefit of outsourcing the Jewish genealogy work required.

However, such a process opens up restitution to manipulation, which seems like it might have happened in the Abramovich case.

The other worrying development that came from the Abramovich news is that the Portuguese government – depending on the result of the official inquiry – could confiscate the citizenships it has granted. The implication of such a confiscation would be serious not only for the beneficiaries of the Sephardic restitution law, but also for debates around citizenship in Europe more generally.

Revocation of citizenship is already a controversial act; citizenship, as Hannah Arendt describes it, is "the right to have rights." While the loss of a secondary citizenship would not have such grave consequences for the Russian oligarch, normalizing citizenship confiscation in the EU is a dangerous precedent to set.

The Abramovich episode (which, despite its high profile, may well not be the only authorized claim made on shady grounds) led the Portuguese government to introduce a new – and quite vague – requirement into its Sephardic citizenship law. In 2020, the government had discussed and ultimately shelved possible amendments to require citizenship recipients to reside in Portugal for two years. The new amendment does not go that far but it does introduce a requirement for applicants to have an "effective connection to Portugal[https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/.premium-portugal-to-change-nationality-law-that-allowed-abramovich-to-gain-citizenship-1.10678449]."

The change will not be retroactive. And what would satisfy this "effective connection" is still unclear. The great majority of people who meet all other requirements do not speak Portuguese, have never been to Portugal, and do not intend to relocate. How far will they have to go to establish and then prove their effective connection? Will a visit suffice? Or will they have to start a business, pay taxes, or declare residence in Portugal?

The speedy amendment does not answer these crucial questions. It is not difficult to see that the addition of such expectations limits the original supposed intent of the law of righting a historic wrong.

The Abramovich episode, under heightened scrutiny due to Putin's war on Ukraine, demonstrates both the unequal hierarchy of citizenship under which we all live and the fact that those who abuse well-meaning and historic reparative measures, such as the Sephardic restitution laws, are often the wealthy elite, like the oligarch Abramovich.

Where the practice of the Portuguese law goes next will reveal how dedicated Lisbon really is to offering citizenship to Sephardic Jews with authentic claims, while distinguishing them from unscrupulous opportunists whose efforts to buy themselves a safe haven threaten the legitimacy of the entire restitution project.

The French ACCS, coached by the Spanish Sergio Mullor and in which Ricardinho plays, will play the Final Four of the UEFA Futsal Champions League, to be played in Riga (Latvia) between April 29 and May 1. The French team will take the place of Russian Tyumen, who won their group, but have been excluded due to UEFA sanctions against Russia.

The French team will thus enter the draw to be held on May 7, along with Barça, Sporting Portugal and Benfica. ACCS finished second in their Elite Round group after losing to Tyumen, drawing with Kazakhstan's Kairat Almaty and beating Belarus' Viten Orsha in the last round. Earlier, in the Main Round, they finished second behind Sporting Portugal and ahead of Dobovec of Slovenia and Kazakhstan's Atyaru.

ACCS has just been proclaimed champion of the French Second Division in which it is playing this season due to a sanction for financial irregularities last season, when it won the First Division with Jesús Velasco on the bench and Carlos Ortiz in the squad.

Portugal to support any EU sanction on Russian oil]]

Portugal will support the EU’s proposal to include oil in the sanctions against Russia, Foreign Minister João Gomes Cravinho said in Luxembourg on Monday.

The proposal has been agreed on in principle by EU members and is currently in the technical study phase.

As he left the meeting with EU heads of diplomacy, during which the 27 EU countries discussed the policy of sanctions against Russia for its military aggression in Ukraine, Gomes Cravinho said[https://www.lusa.pt/article/37970324/portugal-government-will-support-any-eu-sanctions-on-russian-oil] that “a new package of sanctions was approved last Friday, covering coal”, and also covering “other new items, new individuals and new entities”, but recognised that sanctions cannot stop there.

“We know that this is not the end of the story. That is, we know there will be more sanctions. There will have to be an intensification of sanctions in the coming weeks, and we also know that this intensification will pass through oil, and Portugal is aligned with this movement, which has technical dimensions that are still under discussion, but Portugal will support it,” he said.

Questioned about whether there is an understanding among all EU members about a possible total embargo on oil imports, given the great dependence of some, Gomes Cravinho said, “there is unanimity in the sense of considering that it is necessary to intensify sanctions to oblige Russia to curb its path”, but admitted that different situations have to be taken into account.

“What happens, however, is that the impact of sanctions is uneven. It is not equal between Portugal and Slovakia, it is not equal between Italy and Sweden. And so, these disparities have to be taken into account,” he explained.

When asked if the sanctions being considered for Russian oil imports would be an embargo or the imposition of taxes, Gomes Cravinho said it would “more likely be an embargo,” but insisted that “the technical details are still being discussed”.

The meeting came just three days after leaders formally adopted the EU’s fifth package of sanctions targeting Moscow following atrocities witnessed and attributed to Russian forces in Bucha, and which included an embargo on coal imports starting in August.

However, it is mainly the revenues from Russia’s gas and oil exports to the EU that help finance the Russian war machine.

Porto University will fire professor after xenophobic comments against Brazilian women

The University of Porto is about to conclude the dismissal process of a professor accused of making discriminatory comments, including xenophobic statements against Brazilian female students.

Among the phrases uttered were comments such as "Brazilian women are a commodity" and "do you know what a shotgun is? It is that gun that men use to kill women".

Building of the Faculty of Economics, University of Porto, Portugal - University of Porto on Facebook Students accused Pedro Cosme da Costa Vieira, of the Faculty of Economics, of inciting hatred and violence, especially against women, gypsies and immigrants. The process of "disciplinary dismissal" is only awaiting publication in the Official Gazette.

The sanction was approved by the university's Senate in January. According to the preliminary order signed by the rector, António Manuel de Sousa Pereira, the punishment is due to "described and proven behaviors" on the part of the professor. After being the target of a complaint signed by 129 students from the Faculty of Communication, where he taught an introductory economics course, the professor had already been suspended from his activities for a period of 90 days in 2021.

In the document, the students describe Vieira's classes as a "toxic and discriminatory environment," with "several attacks on citizenship, which should not go unpunished." Sought, the University of Porto said it will not comment officially before the publication of the final ruling on the case.

Also in the institution, a professor at the Law School is facing disciplinary investigation proceedings. The professor refused to give a test to a student that he considered to be dressed inappropriately. The case generated enormous repercussion on social networks, platforms on which students increasingly denounce behavior considered inappropriate.

Recently, complaints of harassment and discrimination in the university environment have been widely discussed in Portugal. Last week, it became known that, in only 11 days of operation, a channel in which students can report cases of harassment and misconduct at the University of Lisbon Law School received more than 50 complaints.

The reports referred to 31 professors: almost 10% of the institution's professors and assistants. More than half of the reports refer to seven professors, with one of them concentrating nine complaints. Among the validated complaints, which can be in more than one category, there are 29 of moral harassment, 22 of sexual harassment, 8 of sexist practices, 5 of xenophobia and racism (including Brazilian victims) and 1 of homophobia.

The information was revealed by the newspaper Diário de Notícias, which had access to the report produced from the complaints. The document describes that there are "serious and repeated problems of sexual and moral harassment perpetrated by professors". The institution is one of the most traditional in the country, and the case has had enormous repercussions. The college management informed that it will forward the report to the Public Ministry.

Last Thursday (7), student associations, including the Movement Against Sexual Harassment in Academics, held a demonstration in front of the rectory of the University of Lisbon. About 200 students were present at the act, which called for a safer university environment and an end to the perception of impunity surrounding abuse by professors.

... The university reality, which is already difficult for Portuguese students, becomes even more complex for foreigners. For more than a decade, Brazilian students have formed the largest community of foreigners in higher education in Portugal, where 51 institutions accept Enem as a means of entry.

Although there is intensive work to attract Brazilian students, who pay up to ten times the tuition of a Portuguese student in some courses, many complain of discrimination. In 2019, the Law School of the University of Lisbon had already been at the center of a controversy with Brazilians again. A satirical collective installed, at the entrance of the institution, a box with stones next to the sign "Free to shoot a zuca [pejorative way to designate Brazilian]."

The case led to protests from Brazilian students, who report similar situations in several institutions.

Among the main problems pointed out by the young people is the discrimination with Brazilian Portuguese and the Brazilian accent. With the increase in Brazilian immigration to Portugal, which grew for the fifth consecutive year and reached a record 209,072 people in 2021, reports of discrimination have also been growing in the school environment. In November 2020, several schools and universities in greater Lisbon appeared vandalized with racist messages and against Brazilians.

Federation leader does not believe World Rugby will back out of Spain

The president of the Portuguese Rugby Federation (FPR) said today that he does not believe World Rugby (WR) will go back on Spain's withdrawal from the 2023 World Cup, a decision that puts Portugal in the final playoff tournament."Having the right to appeal, [Spain] has. But I don't believe [that WR will change the decision]," Carlos Amado da Silva told Lusa news agency, moments after officially learning of the decision.

World Rugby (WR) today confirmed Portugal's presence in the playoff tournament for the France2023 World Cup after the 10-point sanction imposed on Spain, which can, however, appeal the decision.

"Subject to Spain's right of appeal, the 10-point deduction applied in the classification for the 2023 World Cup means that Romania qualifies as Europe 2 for Group B, in place of Spain, and that Portugal replaces Romania in the final qualification tournament in November 2022," the body that oversees rugby at international level indicated.

The FPR, however, "in no way contributed" to the WR's decision, Amado da Silva stressed, since "not only did not denounce [Spain], but also proposed a different solution.

In a WR meeting, before the appointment of the independent committee to assess the possible Spanish default, the Portuguese federation leader proposed "that Portugal, Romania and Spain play a tournament" to "decide, in the field", who would accompany Georgia, already qualified in the first place in the qualifying round.

The proposal, however, was not accepted by WR and Amado da Silva admitted to be "sorry" that Portugal's re-entry in the race for France2023 "is made at the expense of Spain", since "I wish they were both in the World Cup", but also recalled that "nothing could be done to prevent it".

"We finally had a bit of luck, in the midst of so many bad luck," he vented.

WR's decision is, "no doubt", very positive for Portuguese rugby, which will now try to "rebuild a competitive team" to compete in the playoff tournament in November.

"We have quality, now we have to work. We need more support, especially from WR", Amado da Silva appealed.

The final qualifying tournament for France2023 will be played in November, in a 'round robin' format (everyone against everyone in one round), on dates and venues still to be announced by WR.

Portugal is, for now, the only team with a place in the play-offs, where it will face the losing teams of the Asia/Pacific and America play-offs, as well as the runner-up of the African Rugby Cup 2022, competitions that will be decided in July.

In Portugal's way will be, therefore, the losers of the meetings between Tonga and the future Asian champion, between the USA and Chile, in addition to the team that loses the final of the African Cup, which will be played in France.

On March 28, 15 days after the victory over Portugal that qualified Spain directly for France2023, the WR appointed an independent commission to examine Spain's potential non-compliance with the player eligibility law.

At issue was the use of Gavin van der Berg, a South African-born prop used by the 'leones' in the two meetings against the Netherlands, which Spain won 43-0 and 52-7, picking up five points in each meeting via the offensive bonus.

World Rugby's eligibility rules state that a player may become eligible to represent a country other than the one of his birth by family descent or by residing in the new country for three years continuously or 10 years alternately.

Gavin Van der Berg arrived in Spain in 2018 and made his debut for the 'leones' in December 2021, but reportedly interrupted his 'stay' in Spain between May and September 2019 when he reportedly returned to South Africa after the end of the Spanish league.

This is the second time in a row that Spain has been left out of the World Cup due to the irregular use of players.

In 2018, World Rugby sanctioned Spain, Romania and Belgium for using ineligible players, a decision that resulted in Russia's direct qualification to the 2019 World Cup after finishing fourth in qualification.

Spain will appeal the penalty of 10 points in the qualification for the Rugby World Cup, a World Rugby (WR) decision that qualifies Portugal for the playoff tournament, confirmed this Friday the president of the federation of that country.In a press conference at the Higher Council of Sport in Madrid, Alfonso Feijoo confirmed the intention to appeal to an appeal committee within 14 days and that he will then step down as head of the sport in Spain.

Related Portugal in rugby World Cup playoff after Spain sanction "I understand the disappointment of the players, the 'staff' and the fans, the most damaged by a decision of World Rugby that did not consider the exceptional circumstances surrounding the case. Therefore, I confirm that we will appeal the decision, which seems disproportionate to us, and takes away from us what we earned on the field", said Alfonso Feijoo.

The leader also took the opportunity to "regret the outcome", but assured that the federative leaders were "deceived" and that he never thought "that someone could allegedly falsify an official document in rugby", but promised to take responsibility.

"Before you ask me, I'll tell you right now: I'm leaving. But not before the processes are sufficiently underway and without the possibility that the new officials of Spanish rugby can suspend them without approval from the authorities," he announced.

Feijoo, moreover, reiterated the information that the South African-origin pillar, Gavin Van den Berg, and his club, Alcobendas, "allegedly falsified" the player's passport so that he could be registered as a training player and comply with WR law 8, concerning the eligibility of players to represent a national team.

WR on Thursday confirmed Portugal's presence in the playoff tournament for the 2023 World Cup in France, following the 10-point sanction imposed on Spain.

"Subject to Spain's right of appeal, the 10-point deduction applied to the qualification for the 2023 World Cup means that Romania qualifies as Europe 2 for Group B in place of Spain and that Portugal replaces Romania in the final qualification tournament in November 2022," the international rugby governing body indicated.

With Cristiano Ronaldo's goal, Manchester United beat Brentford 3-0: the mark that proves that CR7 "beats time".

At a very special moment in his life, Cristiano Ronaldo continues to show signs of his validity and at 37 years of age he confirms that he is one of the best strikers on the planet. This Monday he scored one of the goals in Manchester United's 3-0 win over Brentford, his 18th goal of the season, the same amount he scored in the 2008/2009 season, the last one he played in the city. The Portuguese striker is third in the scoring charts.

CR7 and his partner Georgina Rodriguez have just suffered the loss of one of their twin sons. In recent days the striker posted a photo with the baby and wrote "Love forever". He returned to the field of play and was embraced by the entire Red Devils squad and the public.

The player, who returned to United this season, was in the starting lineup on Monday in the match that closed the 35th day of the English championship. The account was opened by Bruno Fernandes, who anticipated after a cross in the ninth minute.

Later, Ronaldo flattered with a backheel between three opponents in the box for Juan Mata, whose shot was deflected wide. In the 44th minute, the Spaniard repaid the Spaniard's kindness and converted, but his goal was disallowed for an offside call at the behest of the VAR.

At the start of the second half, Fernandes missed the second for the home team. Although the differences widened after 61 minutes with a penalty fouled to CR7 himself, who was brought down in the area. The Lusitanian scored his 142nd goal in 329 games for the English team with a cross-shot.

In the 72nd minute, Raphael Varane scored the third from a corner kick and the Frenchman went in alone and from the ground to send it in. With his goal, the Frenchman decorated the final result. With this victory, United remains sixth in the table and is entering the Conference League, the third club competition in Europe, something that seems little for a giant used to fight for the title in the Champions League, a trophy it won three times.

Back to CR7, in 2021/2022, the striker has scored 24 goals in 38 matches and provided 3 assists for United. anchester 13 years ago. For this reason, the comparison went viral and the networks began to talk about Ronaldo "beating time". In addition, he qualified with his national team for the Qatar 2022 World Cup and will play his fifth World Cup. The Lusitanian is the top scorer in the history of national teams with 115 goals, a merit he achieved by surpassing Iran's Ali Daei, who reached 109.

Also this season, the striker reached another milestone, that of being the top scorer in history. That was when he scored his 806th goal (between club and national team), beating Austria's Josef Bican, the previous record holder, by one goal. That happened in March with his hat-trick against Tottenham on matchday 29 of the Premier League. The statistic is based on the tally kept by the International Federation of Football History and Statistics (IFFHS).

The 2021/2022 season is not yet over, and the Portuguese has a lot to give and continue to win his battle against time.

UEFA banned Russia from hosting Euro 2028 and 2032, and Russian clubs will not be allowed to play in international tournaments next season.

The players of the Spanish rugby team announced today their intention to support the appeal of the expulsion from the World Cup France2023, despite some disagreements that separate the athletes from the federation officials.World Rugby (WR) announced on Thursday the withdrawal of 10 points from the 'leones' in World Cup qualification for irregular use of a player in two matches, a decision that throws Spain out of the competition and allows Portugal to climb to third place and qualify for the final playoff tournament.

"We have decided that since we want to go to the World Cup, we will fight inside and outside the offices for the qualification that we won on the field and lost administratively," announced 'captain' Fernando López, after a meeting with the president of the Spanish Rugby Federation (FER), Alfonso Feijoo, and representatives of the board of directors.

Emotional, López was unable to finish reading the statement and ceded the duties to Marco Pinto, who was in charge of explaining that "the FER stated that it is responsible but not guilty" and that, therefore, it will count on the support of the players in the only "path left" to be in France2023: the appeal of the WR's decision.

"Even though there are issues that separate us from the WR, we will work together. The guilty people will take their responsibility. We need your help. Spain must be in the 2023 World Championship," read the Spanish taloner.

Along with López and Pinto, the players Lucas Guillaume and Víctor Sánchez were also present, as well as the selector Santiago Santos, who preferred not to comment.

The players also lamented that after the WR's decision to exclude Spain from the World Cup "nobody came to apologize."

"We are prepared to lose a game on the field, but not for these things. These two years have been very tough, because we started badly, we almost missed the dream. We started to recover and we lost a teammate [Kawa Leauma, killed in an accident in the Netherlands in December after the game between the two countries], we overcame that and then this happens," the players vented.

On March 28, 15 days after the victory over Portugal (33-28) that qualified Spain directly for France2023, the WR appointed an independent commission to examine the potential non-compliance of the Spanish with the player eligibility law.

The selector of Portugal considered this Friday that participation in the playoff tournament for the rugby World Cup "is a second chance", but warned that the wolves have to learn from the mistakes made in qualifying.Speaking to the Lusa agency, Patrice Lagisquet confessed to be "difficult" to comment on the removal of Spain, due to the irregular use of a player in two meetings, for having a close connection with some Spanish players, but recalled that "the rules have to be respected".

"First we have to wait for Spain's appeal and the result, but if it happens, it will be a second chance. If we have that luck, we have to make sure we do our utmost to take advantage of it and win," Lagisquet pointed out.

According to the French coach, it will be necessary to "take lessons from the two games with Romania and in Spain", because they were games in which Portugal had "many problems", although admitting that they lost "some key players before each of those encounters".

Lagisquet confessed, on the other hand, that his difficulty in commenting on the departure from Spain is related to the ties that bind him to Guillaume Rouet, a native of Bayonne, like the coach, or to Manual Ordas, "son of one of the best friends" of his wife, whom he has known "since he was a baby."

"I can only say that I am very disappointed for the players, who got the qualification on the pitch. It's the second time it's happened, and for them, it must be terrible to be experiencing something like this," the Frenchman lamented.

However, Lagisquet stressed that "all sports have rules that have to be respected" and praised "the fact that Portugal does not play with naturalized foreigners".

"I think it's important to play with players born in the country or with a direct degree of kinship, by parents or grandparents born in the country. I think it's something important, to establish a connection," he stressed.

World Rugby (WR) announced, on April 28, the withdrawal of 10 points from the leones in the qualification for the World Cup, for the irregular use of a player in two matches, a decision that throws Spain out of the competition and allows Portugal to climb to third place and qualify for the final playoff tournament.

At issue was the use of Gavin van der Berg, a pillar of South African nationality used by the leones in the two meetings against the Netherlands, which Spain won by 43-0 and 52-7, adding five points in each meeting, through the offensive bonus.

On the same day, the WR confirmed Portugal's presence in the playoff tournament for the 2023 World Cup in France, after the 10-point sanction applied to Spain.

This is the second time in a row that Spain has been left out of the World Cup due to the irregular use of players.

‘Russia did not want to act drastically’ against embassy

The president of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, said on Friday, commenting on the expulsion of five employees of the Portuguese embassy in Moscow, that despite everything, Russia did not want “to be very drastic” with Portugal.

Asked about this during his visit to Timor-Leste, with the foreign minister João Gomes Cravinho by his side, the president noted that “Portugal was one of the last countries to be hit by the Russian response below par, with one or two other cases in Europe.”

“I don’t know if the fact that the Secretary-General of the United Nations [António Guterres] is Portuguese had any influence,” the president added, considering that “Russia, although knowing that Portugal is on a side, which is not its own, does not want to be too drastic in its treatment of Portugal.”

“There were several countries that took the decision, in the framework of the European Union, to sanction the Russian Federation with the forced departure of diplomats and other personnel. In general, the response of the Russian Federation was parity: 25 left, 25 leave; 30 left, 30 leave,” he said.

In the case of Portugal, “the Russian Federation, while responding to the sanctions with sanctions, ended up applying them to one diplomat and then to other staff and in a number that is about half the number of those affected by the Portuguese sanctions”.

Asked about the Russian authorities’ decision to expel five staff members from Portugal’s embassy in Moscow came shortly before Prime Minister António Costa’s visit to Kyiv, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa replied that this “shows Portugal’s alignment”.

According to the president, “the prime minister’s presence [in Kyiv], accepting an invitation from the Ukrainian prime minister, shows that Portugal is aligned with Ukraine and, therefore, it was inevitable that Russia would sanction it.”

“All the bodies of political power in Portugal from the first moment have condemned the Russian invasion,” he stressed.

The decision by Russian Federation to expel five staff members from the Portuguese embassy in Moscow was made public on Thursday by the foreign ministry in a statement.

“The ambassador of Portugal in Moscow was called this morning to the ministry of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation and was informed of the expulsion of 5 embassy staff members, who will have to leave Russia within 14 days,” the statement read.

In the same statement, the Portuguese government “repudiates the Russian authorities’ decision, which has no justification other than simple retaliation.

Following this statement, the foreign minister spoke to journalists in Dili, regretting and rejecting the decision of the Russian authorities, but stressed that the Portuguese embassy in Moscow remains functional.

“We repudiate these expulsions because they have no justification except for pure retaliation. The officials we expelled from the Russian embassy in Lisbon were conducting activities that were not appropriate to their status under the Vienna Convention [on Diplomatic Relations],” the minister said.

According to João Gomes Cravinho, “the five officials expelled from Moscow, on the contrary, have always behaved impeccably in the face of their obligations under the Vienna Convention.”

“I want to stress that our embassy remains functional,” added the minister, who was speaking on the sidelines of the investiture ceremony of the new president of Timor-Leste, José Ramos-Horta.

“The important thing is that our embassy will remain functional,” he said.

The foreign minister said that “the Russian government made a statement indicating that there was an unfriendly attitude on the part of Portugal,” a justification that he rejected.

“The attitude was not unfriendly. The attitude was to consider that officials of the Russian embassy in Lisbon who are with diplomatic status and, therefore, are under the rules of the Vienna Convention, have to behave according to those rules. When this is not the case, Portugal naturally has the right to expel them,” he countered.

As for the staff of the Portuguese embassy in Moscow, the minister expressed “great appreciation” for their work, which he qualified as “always impeccable, according to the instructions received from Lisbon and under the rules of the Vienna Convention.”

“In any case, Russia understood that this was sufficient reason to expel. We disagree,” he reinforced.

Asked what the Portuguese government would do, he replied: “According to the rules of the Vienna Convention, the receiving state, in this case, Russia, has the right to expel the people it wants, but we reject it because there is no justification. So we accept it, but we regret it and consider it not justifiable”.

The minister said that the Russian authorities had identified “the specific people who should be expelled” and said, “now it is a question of dealing with logistics, but they will leave within 14 days”.

The Kremlin's advisor on climate affairs said today that Western sanctions may cause "complications" in the short term, but assured that Russian President Vladimir Putin's goal for carbon neutrality will be met. "In the short term we foresee some complications related to sanction restrictions on the supply of certain appliances and equipment, but this is surmountable," Ruslan Edelgeriyev assured Lusa news agency.

The leader of the Russian delegation at the Oceans Conference in Lisbon, which runs from today until July 1, also assured that the goals for the "long term do not change" and that "all the tasks of the President of the Russian Federation to achieve carbon neutrality will be fulfilled.

Ruslan Edelgeriyev was responding to Lusa about whether the conflict in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed by the West on Moscow could change Russia's climate goals.

When asked if the increase in inflation in Russia and other countries could delay the adoption of environmental policies by Russian companies, the Kremlin advisor argued that "it is not so easy" to continue the 'business as usual' policy in the scope of environmental strategies.

"The Russian government has decided to postpone the start of implementation of some measures in environmental protection, but has given a clear signal to businesses - after a temporary pause, businesses should move to new technologies at double speed. Decarbonization of the Russian economy is continuing unabated - we aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060," he pointed out. Ruslan Edelgeriyev also said that "new assessments have emerged from Russian analytical organizations" that the country may "be able to stop having a negative impact on the climate much sooner.

Vladimir Putin's envoy to the summit in Lisbon also pointed out that Moscow's relations "with many Western countries are at a low level," although he declined to use the term 'isolated. "It is obvious, however, that the world is not limited to the West," he retorted, in written answers sent to Lusa.

The 46-year-old diplomat, a former prime minister of Chechnya, also stressed that many countries, mainly outside the West, are willing to cooperate with Moscow even though they "voted against" Russia when the UN general assembly passed a resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early March, with the support of 141 of the 193 UN member states.

"The world is not black and white. If two countries have different assessments of any events, that does not shut down the possibility of constructive interaction between them on other issues, especially on generally significant issues such as climate change, protection of the maritime environment, biodiversity conservation and others," he stressed.

Thus, Ruslan Edelgeriyev assured that Russia is available to promote initiatives, albeit "to a certain extent." "From our point of view, it is not so important who will be assigned this or that initiative - us or another party. After all, if the initiative is useful, everyone will benefit," he reminded, in a reference to possible proposals on oceans at the UN summit being held in Lisbon.

For Ruslan Edelgeriyev, being chosen by Vladimir Putin to head the delegation to Portugal is "natural," after having represented the country at other similar events. "A short [while ago] I was appointed, by Russian President Vladimir Putin, as the chief negotiator on the three Rio conventions, which reflects our country's unified approach to ecological and climate problems. In addition, I have headed the cross-sectoral working group on climate change and sustainable development," he pointed out.

The head of Chechnya's government from 2012 to 2018 also refused any fears of a possible boycott of Russia's participation in the summit, assuring that he is a "supporter of constructive dialogues."

"I hope that colleagues from other countries will also put solving global sustainable development problems ahead of political ambitions," he concluded.

The United Nations Conference on the Oceans will be held in Lisbon, with the support of the governments of Portugal and Kenya, and will be attended by heads of state and government from all continents.

Switzerland and Portugal both draw (2-2)

Group C closes the first day with four teams with one point

BARCELONA, 9 (EUROPA PRESS)

The Netherlands began their title defense on Saturday with a hard-fought draw (1-1) against Sweden, Olympic runners-up in Tokyo, a draw that also ended up being triggered in the other Group C match between Portugal and Switzerland (2-2), leaving everything open for the second day of the group stage.

The reigning champions made their Euro debut frustrated by injuries to goalkeeper Sari Van Veenendaal and center back Aniek Nouwen in the first half. In addition, Sweden, who won the inaugural edition of this tournament in 1984, took the lead in the 36th minute with an Andersson finish.

Luis Echeverría will be mourned in Cuajimalpa and cremated at the Spanish Pantheon Former Mexican President Luis Echeverría dies at 100 years of age AMLO reacts to the death of Luis Echeverría Álvarez, Mexico's former president Sweden's momentary victory left the Netherlands in serious doubt, as they tried to rediscover their game while their opponents showed their criteria in attack and their solvency in defense without giving the Dutch any options.

After the break, Jill Roord came to the Netherlands' rescue to equalize (1-1) in the 52nd minute, taking advantage of a loose ball in the box to finish and put the first-half deficit behind them.

The goal had no effect on Sweden, who had the better chances to take the lead, but the scoreline remained unchanged and the two sides shared the points in a match of continental champions.

In the other match of the day, Switzerland got off to a dream start with goals from Coumba Sow and Rahel Kiwic in the first five minutes. A start that allowed them to get the three points, but Portugal, who are playing in the continental competition due to the UEFA sanction against Russia, woke up to ruin the 'feast'.

Francisco Neto's team came to life in the second half and went on the attack to close the gap. Diana Gomes and Jessica Silva put a damper on Switzerland's flying start and brought the scores level at the end of a wild finale.

The frantic pace of the game took over in the closing stages and a succession of attacks were unleashed on both goals. But Portugal's Encarnaçao and Switzerland's Reuteler were unsettled by the post and the points were shared to leave the group level with Sweden and the Netherlands still to play for.

THE EXCESS OF COVID DEATHS

Despite the vaccines and the slowdown in the pandemic, the number of Covid deaths in Portugal is still excessively high. We are the third worst country in the EU in number of deaths per million inhabitants. And if we compare the number of deaths today with the same period in 2021, the difference is frightening: we have seven times more Covid deaths today than in the same period in 2021. Are we doing everything to avoid this state of affairs?There are doctors who think not and even blame the DGS. This is the case of João Carlos Winck. In an opinion article in Público, this specialist is brutal in his conclusions. He says:"With the antiviral therapeutic weapons we now have at our disposal, this mortality is not acceptable.""To date only one treatment has been dispensed with Paxlovid in Portugal (one of the most effective antivirals that is intended to prevent the disease from evolving into hospitalization or death).""Such restrictive indications from the DGS are due to the existence of very low stocks of the drugs. Why were they not purchased in adequate quantities?""In this 6th pandemic wave, access to antivirals should be equitable, speedy and transparent."Therefore, a clarification from the DGS is necessary: why did Portugal buy few antiviral drugs? Why are they widely used in Spain and not in Portugal? Will the DGS review its behavior or will it keep everything the same?PROMISCUITY BETWEEN POLITICS AND JUSTICE

José Sócrates is currently on appeal to the STJ, within the scope of Operation Marquês. One of the judges to whom this appeal has gone is Counselor Lopes da Mota. What is unusual about this? Two things: first, the connection of this Council Judge to Sócrates; then the " spinning plates " between politics and justice that generate a perception of promiscuity between the two sectors . Let's see:Lopes da Mota was Sócrates' colleague in the government. Secretary of State for Justice between 1996 and 1999.Lopes da Mota had a disciplinary sanction from the MP because of Sócrates. He tried to have the Freeport "investigation" closed (2009).Lopes da Mota "returned to Government" as Deputy to former Minister Francisca Van Dunen in 2020/21.The first situation is apparently over. The Judge has asked to be excused from intervening in this process. The second is more structural and unresolved. It is not enough for a magistrate to be independent. It is also necessary to have an opinion. Someone who "jumps" from justice to politics and from politics to justice generates a suspicion: the suspicion that he is not independent. This has happened with several magistrates in PS and PSD governments.There is only one way to end these suspicions of promiscuity. It is to do what the President of the STJ, Henrique Araújo, intends to do: put an end to the turntables between politics and justice. A magistrate who wants to go into government can go. But he can no longer go back. May the President of the STJ have the strength to see his idea through!

THE DEATH OF JOSÉ EDUARDO DOS SANTOS

The former President of Angola was a controversial and remarkable personality. For some, he was the great architect of peace and that is worth more than anything else; for others, he was the leader who favored widespread corruption.Frankly, I think Eduardo dos Santos was both. He was the architect of peace and unity in Angola. He put an end to a brutal civil war of almost 30 years. But he was also the leader who gave cover to corruption and widespread poverty. Even though Angola is Africa, not Europe. Valuing only one side does not seem to be an unbiased and independent judgment.

Probably Angolans value more the dimension of the statesman who made peace and built the unity of the Angolan nation. This is understandable. The war left brutal human consequences. History will certainly not fail to register both aspects of his legacy.

Eduardo dos Santos' death comes at a time of great political tension in Angola and is aggravating this climate of tension even more.We are a month and a half away from elections in Angola, the most disputed elections ever, held in an environment of strong social discontent.The relationship between President João Lourenço and part of the Dos Santos family is terrible, aggravated by a daughter of the former President who has further "poisoned" the political climate with serious accusations.Finally, there is a serious conflict: the Government of Angola wants to hold a state funeral in Luanda and is even going to build a Memorial in honor of José Eduardo dos Santos, which will be the future National Pantheon of Angola; a part of the family thinks that the government wants to take political advantage of the figure of Eduardo dos Santos and therefore wants to avoid the transfer of the body to Luanda.The funeral of José Eduardo dos Santos has become a political and electoral affair.100 DAYS OF GOVERNMENT

The evocation of the first 100 days of the Government coincided with two atypical situations, both without meaning:First, Chega's Motion of Censure. It was a political joke. It only served to show that André Ventura is more nervous with Luís Montenegro's leadership than he was with Rio's leadership.Second, the requests coming from inside the PS and the Government, according to Expresso, for the Prime Minister to make a reshuffle after the summer. They are even talking about Carlos César for the government. It's an exaggeration. To talk about a reshuffle in a government that is only 100 days old is another sign of nervousness.None of this is surprising. Ithas already been seen in the last two years of Cavaquismo. A long time in power generates what we are seeing in the government: fatigue, lack of coordination, lack of initiative, ministers speculating in the newspapers. But there are essential differences:The first is that this time the fatigue came earlier. There is an explanation for this: it is harder to govern today than it was 20 or 30 years ago.The second is that this government has few results to present. Therefore, it is running for its losses. This is the case of Health. The first major measure in the SNS was approved this week (after almost 7 years of government). Until it is fully implemented it will take another half a year to a year. And it remains to be seen if, even then, it will have positive results.The third difference is that we are still far away from the most critical year: 2024. Anything is possible in that year. It is possible that everything will remain the same. But it is also possible that the Prime Minister leaves for Brussels and there are early elections.BORIS JOHNSON'S EXIT

This exit is just too late. If it were not for the war in Ukraine, the British Prime Minister would have already fallen. He fell late, but he fell well. He has set a bad example, with objectionable ethical behavior: the pandemic parties; the successive lies; the lack of respect for citizens and institutions.Life is not easy for populists. Manifestly they are better in opposition than in governance. Trump lost elections. Boris Johnson has fallen. Bolsonaro is about to fall. Admittedly, they are all different: Bolsonaro is basic; Trump on the verge of Bolsonaro is a talent; Boris is clearly the best prepared of the three. But they all have in common a demagogic vein and an absence of convictions. Take the example of the British Prime Minister: he started out being against the UK leaving the EU and ended up being the leader of Brexit when he realized that was the best way to become leader.Who will succeed Boris? It is too early to draw conclusions. Not least for a reason that is new: this time, the prime minister is ousted without there being a "pre-established" alternative. In the past, in analogous situations, everything happened differently. When Margaret Thatcher fell, there was John Major; when Blair fell, there was Gordon Brown; when Theresa May fell, there was Boris Johnson. Now there are many candidates and the outcome is unpredictable.Politically, what changes with a new leader? Probably very little:War in Ukraine. Nothing substantial will change. Conservatives and Labour are united in fighting Russia and supporting Ukraine.Relationship with the EU. There may be a change in tone, not in substance. No one is going to reverse Brexit. The tone towards the conflict over Northern Ireland is that it may be different.Change, probably only in attitudes. Which is no small thing.THE STATE OF THE WAR

In the war itself there is not much new. What there are are two radically different strategies: Russia's strategy has clear objectives and a clear timetable:After the 1st phase of the Donbass the next objective is to conquer Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.Next the intention is to try to conquer the cities of Kharkiv and Sumi.Russia is benefiting from the good weather and the fact that the new equipment has not yet arrived in Ukraine.Putin's speech this week proves this: militarily, this is a good moment for Russia.Ukraine's strategy is quite different: right now it is in a defensive phase, preparing a counter-offensive in August.Ukraine is waiting for the new heavy equipment coming from the West.It is preparing a strong counter-attack starting in August.The major strategic priority is the recapture of Kherson.The tactical intention is to reinforce sabotage actions.In the meantime, Ukraine is expected to put up a strong fight in Donetsk province.Outside of the war, the only big news is the Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Ukraine: it was drawn up by 3,000 Ukrainian and Western experts; it will cost about 720 billion Euros; it requires the reconstruction of 200 hospitals and 1,200 schools; and it will be paid for essentially by the EU and the US.

ALISON KOSIK, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Alison Kosik. Ahead on CNN Newsroom, Ukrainians suffer heavy Russian bombardment. The mayor of one key city says they counted 36 rockets in the night.

In Sudan, 1000s of protesters take to the streets, calling for their military rulers to be prosecuted following a CNN investigation. And fires blaze across parts of Portugal and Italy as Europe summer of extreme heat intensifies.

We begin in Ukraine where Russian forces unleashed a barrage of shelling on the southern city of Mykolaiv on Sunday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, condemning the attack in his nightly address.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): Ukrainians within these 24 hours, Mykolaiv in the region experienced the most brutal shelling during the entire period of the full scale war. Dozens of missiles and rockets, the occupiers hit residential buildings, schools, social infrastructure and industrial facilities.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KOSIK: Two deaths have been confirmed in the wake of Sunday's attack, a Ukrainian business mogul and his wife killed while sheltering in their basement. The damage seen across the city was immense. Mykolaiv's Mayor telling our Nic Robertson it was one of the worst attacks he's seen since the war began.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

OLEKSANDR SENKEVYCH, MYKOLAIV, UKRAINE MAYOR: Together, we counted about 36 shots for sure. This is the biggest demand of rockets that they launched bombarded. The main aim of this is to ruin buildings and places rather huge.

NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: So why do you think that they've ratcheted up the number of strikes?

SENKEVYCH: First of all, they don't have any success on ground operations and they want to, you know, to hit people. Moreover, the new tactics for the strike is that they are using pro-Russian telegram channels where they right, like, we know that some armored people, vehicles in emails are stored in different places.

ROBERTSON: Are there saboteurs working in the city trying to help the Russians?

SENKEVYCH: For sure. I'm sure that they have spies who go in around the city and they say, like I saw the number of machines or the people, military people, with people, there, there. They send this information and Russian attack us.

ROBERTSON: And do you think those saboteurs might have helped in the attacks last night?

SENKEVYCH: I'm sure they helped.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KOSIK: Meanwhile, this was the scene in the Odessa Region after a Russian missile strike set off a grass fire. According to local officials, Russian forces fired at least two missiles from occupied Crimea. So far, there's no word on any casualties. Russian missile strikes were also reported in Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv. Officials there say the attack destroyed a printing house that makes schoolbooks.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

OLEH PAVLIUK, PRINTING HOUSE WORKER (through translator): At 4:05 in the morning, two Russian rockets hit the facility. Basically half of the production facilities that produced schoolbooks until the last moment are destroyed. The printing house is rendered out of service.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KOSIK: Part of the four-storey building that houses the printing shop collapsed during the attack. The windows of a nearby office building were blown out as well. One employee says it's a vivid example of what Russian Liberation actually means.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

VOLODYMYR LADYKA, PRINTING HOUSE WORKER (through translator): We printed mostly children's needs, photos, journals, encyclopedias books. You can see here on the second floor when our Russian brothers, liberators did today. The third floor is destroyed. The fourth floor doesn't exist anymore. We were liberated and the children were liberated from accessing information.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KOSIK: The U.S. and U.K. are demanding Russia be held accountable for Thursday's attack on a detention facility in Russian occupied Ukraine. The British ambassador to Kyiv says the strike on a prison is part of a pattern of human rights abuses and possible war crimes. Kyiv accuses Russia of killing dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilians in the attack and has opened an investigation. Moscow claims Kyiv is responsible.

[01:05:13]

Russian backed separatists say the death toll has risen to 53 with more than 70 others wounded, remains difficult to verify those figures as the International Red Cross says it has not yet been granted access to the site.

For more on potential war crimes in Ukraine, I want to bring in Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, and former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations. He joins me now from Washington, D.C. Thanks so much for your time.

KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO: Alison, great to be with you. Thank you.

KOSIK: So U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, tweeted that the attack on the detention facility is unconscionable. That's her word and that Moscow's horrific aggression must be held to account. I'm curious what you think the international community should do?

VOLKER: Well, let's start with the facts here. The Russians took these fighters from Azov, the Azovs Steel mill in Mariupol, and they imprison them, they tortured them, they brutalize them, then they put them in this prison, and then they blew up the prison. This is an unconscionable war crime. And our ambassador there, Bridget Brink is absolutely right, to call it out for that.

Second there -- so what does the international community do now? I think there are two things. I think first off, we need to be doing everything we can to collect evidence. And by evidence, I mean, signals intelligence communications, who knew what was going to happen when did they know it? Who gave them the orders to do what they did? Because we need to trace this back to the top, there's no doubt that this is Putin's regime that commanded this, but we have to trace that. And then the second thing is to make sure that we defeat Putin in the war, because as long as Putin survives, as long as Russia survives and takes Ukrainian territory, then there will be no accountability for Russia at the end of the war. In order for there to be accountability, Russia actually needs to be defeated.

KOSIK: Walk us through what the significance would be or what the ramifications would be if, you know, Vladimir Putin were found guilty of war crimes or the proof was presented or, you know, Russia was found to be a state sponsor of terrorism. How could that designation change things? Because Russia just doesn't seem to care. I mean, give you an example, western attempts to sanction the Russian economy, they appear to have really no deterrent effect on the Kremlin's Ukraine war chest?

VOLKER: Right. So you you've raised many things in this question. Let me take them by pieces. The first one is that you are right, that the sanctions have not affected the Kremlin's decision making. That doesn't mean that they have not affected Russia. The Kremlin doesn't care about the state of the Russian people or the state of the Russian economy. They care about power and the exercise of power. But the sanctions actually are doing a good job in making the rest of Russia realize that what Putin is doing is destroying his own country. So this is very important. And that's actually going on the right track. And we have to keep going in that same direction.

The next thing in your question is that the international community needs to hold Putin accountable for war crimes, because of what he has done. And we need to accumulate the evidence, we need to create the legal mechanisms. We need to be ready to go whenever we have an opportunity to say this is a violation of bigger principles. But we won't ever get the chance to actually do that. As long as Putin and the Russian regime that he has created will remain in control. And so it's important that their war in Ukraine fail.

KOSIK: We are six months into this war, what do you think it's going to take to end this war, essentially getting Vladimir Putin to pull back? I mean, how does that happen?

VOLKER: Well, Putin and his people, you know, Lavrov, the Foreign Minister, Zakharova, the Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Peskov, the Kremlin Spokesperson, all of these people are repeating the same lies that Ukraine has to be eliminated. There has to be a denazification, demilitarization of Ukraine, eliminate Ukraine is a state. So that means that in the war effort, they will not stop, they will keep pressuring their own military to fight, fight, fight in order to try to destroy Ukraine. What we see, however, is that Russia does not have the military means to do this. And Ukrainians are actually fighting back successfully, they're defending their territory, they are making counter offenses to push the Russians back.

[01:10:13]

The Russians are not going to give up so there's no negotiated solution with Russia. Ukrainians will not accept that Russia is allowed to keep some Ukrainian territory. So they will not negotiate either. So we are in a war phase right now. And it is in America's interest, Europe's interest, Ukraine's interest to make sure that Russia loses the war. Then we can talk about negotiations to create peace. And I think a stable peace will be based on Russia, realizing and recognizing that it must live within its own territory.

KOSIK: All right, Kurt Volker, thanks so much for joining us.

VOLKER: Thank you so much for having me.

KOSIK: The first ship carrying Ukrainian grain is expected to leave the Odessa Region in the hours ahead. According to the captain, they're hoping to reach Istanbul by Tuesday or Wednesday resuming exports could be a crucial first step in easing the Global Food Crisis sparked by the war, which has trapped millions of tons of grain inside Ukraine for months.

In July, Turkey helped broker a deal between Ukraine and Russia to allow 5 million tons of grain exports per month from Ukrainian ports. The ships will be able to navigate a safe corridor in the Black Sea before passing through Turkey and reaching global markets.

Russian President Vladimir Putin says, his country's Navy is ready to respond with lightning speed if anyone tries to encroach on its sovereignty. His comments coming in his speech marking rushes in navy day on Sunday. He did not mentioned the ongoing war in Ukraine specifically but Mr. Putin did tout the country's Zircon hypersonic cruise missile set for delivery soon. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen has more from Moscow.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: As usual, there was a massive parade of ships on Russia's naval day. And one of the things that was very important was that Vladimir Putin signed into force Russia's new naval doctrine and that naval doctrine lists as the main threat to Russia on the high seas with the Russians call the U.S. quest for domination of the world's oceans.

Now, Vladimir Putin, in his speech in St. Petersburg also laid out what the Russians plan to do about that. He said that these times call for decisive action on Russia's part. The Russians said that they're going to do is they are going to arm a ships with what they call the Zircon hypersonic missile. The Russians say they successfully tested that missile in May of this year. And they say that they want to now deploy it as fast as possible. The Russians believe that as far as hypersonic technology is concerned, and that's one of the fields where they have an edge over the U.S. and other adversaries. The President of the Russian Federation said the first ship that's going to get these hypersonic missiles is going to be the Admiral Gorshkov frigate. That's one of the most modern ships in Russia's naval arsenal, and allegedly also has stealth technology.

Now, one of the things that Vladimir Putin talked less about was the conflict in Ukraine. Of course, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Russian Navy, of course, plays a big role in that invasion, for instance, launching cruise missiles and other missiles at targets in Ukraine, but there have also been losses on the part of the Russian Navy, namely the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, the cruiser Moskva, which was sunk, and then also the Battle of Snake Island, for instance, but there was also a Russian landing craft that was hit by a Ukrainian missile while in the Port of Berdiansk. Nevertheless, Vladimir Putin underlying what he said was the strength of the Russian Navy and said, anybody who tries to infringe on Russia sovereignty will be dealt with in lightning speed. Frederik Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow.

KOSIK: Still to come, Iraq is at a tipping point and the U.S., Iran and others watch closely as protesters keep storming the parliament, a live report from the region, next.

Plus, two massive grain silos collapse in Beirut and there are fears more may soon fall, ahead what may have triggered it all.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[01:16:36]

KOSIK: In Iraq, powerful Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr says Baghdad protests are a golden opportunity for those looking to change the country's political system. Thousands of people stormed the capital's Green Zone twice in the past week. Anger that one of al-Sadr's rivals was nominated as prime minister. The cleric supporters are holding it sit in at the parliament to derail efforts from other groups to form the country's next government. CNN's Nada Bashir is tracking developments from Istanbul for us. NADA, good to see you. Are you able to kind of tell us what the tone is among those taking part in the protests who are taking part in the sit in?

NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Well, look, as you mentioned that, Alison, Muqtada al-Sadr, whose supporters have been the main driving force behind these demonstrations issued that statement yesterday, describing this as a golden opportunity not only to protest against the nomination of his rival, Mohammad Shia al-Sudani, but also for a complete political overhaul for it to call for reforms to rid the government of what he claimed as corruption and injustice within the political system.

And following that statement, yesterday evening, we saw 1000s once again, marching towards parliament, breaching the Greens and storming the parliament building that sit in taking place over the weekend. And we are expecting to see further protests today. And the question really is, whether these will escalate, whether they will continue to gain momentum.

Now, these protests did begin on Wednesday in response to the nomination of al-Sadr's rival leader Mohammad Shia al-Sudani, but they have beyond this extended towards focusing on issues including corruption and injustice within government, but also around the current situation in Iraq. The country is facing a severe economic crisis, rising prices, higher unemployment rates, poor public services. And of course, we have seen months and months of political deadlock of stagnation within the political system. It's important to note that al-Sadr's government actually -- al-Sadr's party actually came out on top in October elections, or they're falling short of that absolute majority. And in turn, they have faced repeated roadblocks in their attempts to form a government and that triggered the mass resignation of southern among the 70 of his lawmakers back in June, in protest against what they believe are these roadblocks causing the stagnation in the political system. But there is a real sense of frustration amongst the Iraqi people. And actually, our team on the ground in Baghdad, actually, were able to speak to some of these demonstrators yesterday who really expressed their frustration with the system. Take a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ADEL ANTHEM, PROTESTER FROM KARBALA (through translator): Our demands are simple, ending corruption from its roots, ending class differences created by people who came from abroad. Some people were given so much, while 80 to 85% of the people went we're almost buried. We will not retreat until we end corruption. We will not retreat until we achieve our demands. Our demands are simple. And these people who are here support reform and religion.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BASHIR: Now, al-Sadr's movement is now calling for parliament to be dissolved for early elections to be held. They think that we opponents, the current system in places presiding over a system of corruption and injustice. The question now with whether these protests will escalate, whether we will seek counter protests and of course whether those calls we've heard for dialogue for resolution will be successful.

[01:20:08]

KOSIK: OK, Nada Bashir, thanks very much.

Abbas Kadhim is the Director at the Atlantic Council's Iraq Initiative, and he joins us from Washington, D.C. Thanks for being with us.

ABBAS KADHIM, DIRECTOR & SENIOR FELLOW, IRAQ INITIATIVE FOR ATLANTIC COUNCIL: Thank you.

KOSIK: So Iraq now has gone, what, more than nine months without a new government, tensions are running high among different political factions. I want to hear what you think about what your biggest concerns are about the political dysfunction that's currently happening in Iraq?

KADHIM: Well, thank you for having me. There is always a concern when there is no government in place, all of Iraqi crises, including the worst and post 2003, the invasion of ISIS that took about 1/3 of Iraqi territory happened in a time of government formation in June 2014. So it is always -- when there is government formation, the energy of the politicians and the political class and the mood of the country, the priorities all are put in the contest to form a government and many posts remain unguarded. So we hope that we will see a government soon this time, the dispute took probably a harder line with the withdrawal of the largest winning block in the October elections.

So when they withdrew their 73 seats, about 1/5 of the -- just over 1/5 of the entire seat numbers in the Iraqi parliament. They also command a very energetic, very vibrant political base or popular bass, I should say, on the street and what we see right now. So it is a -- right now, it's a very difficult challenge. It might prove to be existential challenge if the -- these crowds take a different turn, not just remain the way they are right now.

KOSIK: Do you think part of the political dysfunction is because many don't want to a strong man in power after suffering under the authoritarianism of Saddam Hussein? Same with Nouri al-Maliki, who was Prime Minister until 2014? Do you think there is an attempt here by all sides to keep the central government weak? KADHIM: You're absolutely right. I think what happened is because of the injurious past in post 2000 and pre 2003, Iraqi politicians didn't want to risk having another strong dictator or strong central government, and they elected for a parliamentary system and without even anticipating that this system doesn't work for Iraq, given the last -- the lack of trust among Iraqis. Iraqis have a very hard history, difficult history and many ethno sectarian fourth lines. And that trust needs to be built.

So now, we don't have anybody who is able alone to form a government and govern Iraq. Also, there are many forces in Iraq, whether it is the Kurds and Kurdistan, they do not want a strong central government that could truncate the current, almost absolute autonomy they have. There are also parties and groups who are influential in Iraq, and they do not want somebody to force them to go in a direction. They don't want to also some regional countries. I'm thinking of Iran, Saudi Arabia. And basically they don't what an Iraq that is strong, that is on its feet. They want an Iraq that is strong enough to hold its own ground but not strong enough to stand to their encroachment onto their advances and the region itself is a difficult region.

So there is the external meddling. And I think we, in the United States, who are the -- those who brought the change in Iraq dictated the terms also did not do a good job at building a good political system for Iraq. We dropped the ball and many turns on the road.

KOSIK: All right, Abbas Kadhim, thanks so much for being here

In Beirut, Lebanon, two massive grain silos collapsed and others are expected to fall according to Lebanese media reports. Watch this.

So far, no reports of injuries to people in the surrounding areas. The silos which withstood a massive chemical explosion and 2020 have been burning for weeks prompting fears they would eventually fall. Some officials say soaring temperatures in Beirut ignited fermenting grains inside the silos. Thursday marks the two year anniversary of when the explosion rocked the port killing more than 200 people.

Cuba's capital Havana is facing daily power blackouts amid a worsening energy crisis. Beginning this week electricity will be periodically cut for four hours during the late morning and early afternoon. That's according to the local Communist Party Daily. The blackouts will take place every three days. Authorities have also canceled Havana's citywide Carnival celebrations, which usually take place throughout August. Instead, there will be smaller celebrations held at the end of the month.

Still to come, how a CNN exclusive report has triggered 1000s of protesters in Sudan to call for an end to military rule in the African nation.

Plus, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her delegation will begin their Indo-Pacific tour in Singapore. But there's still no word on a stop in Taiwan, a live report straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KOSIK: Welcome back. I'm Alison Kosik. You're watching CNN Newsroom. In Sudan, 1000s of demonstrators took to the streets in Khartoum, calling for a return to civilian rule and prosecution of Sudan's military rulers for corruption. Their demands follow a month long CNN investigation into Russia's plunder of Sudan's gold, sparking widespread outrage.

On Sunday, protesters attempted to head to Sudan's presidential offices, but were met by police who responded with tear gas, but some protesters say they won't back down.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

GHAZY ALRAYAH, ACTIVIST (through translator): It is very clear that protests are met with repression, which makes us more persistent to end the coup and to have our civilian state. God willing.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KOSIK: In our exclusive report, CNN revealed how Moscow stopped democratic change in Sudan, just as its people had successfully toppled one of the longest standing African dictators through peaceful street protests. Why? Sudan is one of the world's biggest exporters of gold, and Russia has been illegally exploiting and smuggling this resource from Sudan for years.

CNN's Nima Elbagir and her team traveled to the north of Sudan to show how Russia manipulates the Sudanese military government and how it's using front companies to get around U.S. sanctions to hold on to the gold.

[01:29:45]

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Deep in Sudan's Gold Country, miners toil in the searing heat, barely surviving in what should be one of Africa's richest countries, providing gold for a war a continent away.

We investigate a force more powerful than Sudan's government controlling its gold subverting Sudan's destiny, threatening me and our sources and thwarting democracy to evade sanctions in Russia's war on Ukraine.

ELBAGIR: "Russian manager is on his way," they say.

ELBAGIR (voice over): We uncover the extent of Russia's grip on Sudan.

For millennia, Sudan has produced some of the most sought-after gold in the world. And Putin's private army, the notorious paramilitary group Wagner, knows it.

ELBAGIR: Sudan's government is denying Wagner's existence in country but we're not buying it and we've come to investigate.

ELBAGIR(voice-over): Wagner's tentacles stretch right across Africa. We've discovered some of its most notorious operatives are working on Sudan. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Wagner. Mikhail Potepkin, Prigozhin's head of Sudan ops and Alexander Sergeyevich Kuznetsov, Wagner's key enforcer previously convicted of kidnap and robbery, working with this man, Sudanese General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, aka Hemetti in a quid pro quo for training and weaponry.

We travel 200 miles north from the capital Khartoum to gold country to take a closer look at Wagner's main moneymaker, artisanal gold.

Miners bring rocks they extract here to be processed. 85 percent of Sudan's gold is produced artisanal.

ELBAGIR: This right here, it may not look like much. This is what's left after the rocks that the miners have brought in is milled. Now they've taken what they can out of it. But this gets sold. And what is properly processed with someone who has superior technology, you can make 10 times what those miners over there are making.

ELBAGIR (voice-over): Ten times more money without any of the back breaking work. And the only foreign processing plant operational in Sudan is Wagner's Meroe Gold, despite a Sudanese law limiting ownership to locals.

Also troubling, Meroe Gold was sanctioned two years ago by the United States for exploiting Sudan's natural resources and spreading their malign influence around the globe.

According to the Sudanese government, they officially ceased operations but they are still here, still evading sanctions. We verified their location with coordinates provided by Sudanese anti- corruption investigators and head there to see for ourselves.

As we approach, the red flag of the former Soviet Union blows in the wind. Increasingly used by Russian nationalists, it brazenly marks the Meroe Gold compound. A Russian tanker sits next to it.

We get to the entrance and decide to ask a few questions but not before we turn on our covert cameras.

ELBAGIR: Is this the Russian company?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): Yes,

ELBAGIR (voice-over): Well, that's convenient. They've just confirmed the Russians are at this location.

ELBAGIR: We are journalists from CNN. I'd like to see the Russian manager. We'd like to ask him some questions.

There's a black pickup approaching.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): He's coming in that car.

ELBAGIR: OK. Guys just confirmed that the Russian manager is in that black pickup and is on his way to us.

ELBAGIR (voice-over): A Russian van races to the office but no one seems to be coming over.

ELBAGIR: It seems the Russian manager has changed his mind.

ELBAGIR (voice-over): But others turn up instead.

ELBAGIR: I'm sure you've already been shown our permission.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): But we are a Sudanese company. It's a company called Al Solag.

ELBAGIR (voice-over): They claim this plant is Sudanese-owned and is called Al Solag. Remember that name? It's important, Al Solag.

We head off the property to do some more filming but we're followed.

Security approaches. They want us to stop.

ELBAGIR: This is public ground.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no.

ELBAGIR: This is public ground.

Why is your barn stopping here?

Trying to get us to move on. They're taking pictures of us, of our license plates.

[01:34:49]

ELBAGIR(voice-over): The reason they're so nervous, Al Solag is a front for the Russian company Meroe Gold. Wagner is still operating illegally, a foreign company pretending to be Sudanese to evade U.S. sanctions.

We obtained their registration documents to prove it. The document on the left is from Meroe Gold, the one on the right Al Solag. These dates represent complaints made in employment courts against Meroe Gold. These ones from Al Solag are the same.

Under Sudanese law, when a company's holdings are transferred, so are any judgments against it. Here, you can see the judgments against both companies are identical.

All they've done is changed the name, Wagner hiding in plain sight to avoid U.S. sanctions and keep the financial pipeline flowing back to Moscow and its war on Ukraine. A dangerous business to delve into.

ELBAGIR: Since we've arrived in country, I've been informed by sources of threats that they believe to be credible against me. They say that's what happens here. When you look too closely at Russia's business dealings, we have to meet one of those sources and he's asked that I come along. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): Meroe Gold is a front for the Russians, specifically for the forces of Wagner that are working to exploit gold in Sudan and its export. It's a front, it's not a company. It extracts gold from tailings and it buys gold from the Sudanese artisanal miners.

That's not legal, because the law says that any gold producer is supposed to report the quantity it produces to the central bank and to the ministry of mining and that does not happen.

ELBAGIR (voice-over): Inside Sudan central bank, a whistleblower snapped this photo of a computer screen, showing official production in 2021 at 49.7 tons, 32.7 tons are unaccounted for by the central bank.

But the real figure we're told by whistleblowers could be over 220 tons. That's around $13.4 billion worth of gold a year that's being stolen from Sudan. How has this happened?

Two years ago, the Sudanese people successfully overthrew Africa's second longest ruling dictator, Omar al-Bashir. 18 months later, the military staged its own coup, sweeping aside civilian rule. And they did this, we're told, with Wagner's support in exchange for gold.

This man had a front row seat to Russia's machinations and has evidence to prove it stood to gain by supporting the Sudanese military's coup. Under threat of assassination, he's been in hiding for the last nine months moving from safe house to safe house.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Russians have Sudanese officers saw the civilians in the government as an obstacle to the plan. The official anti-corruption Task Force wasn't caving to pressure or threats or even bribery.

The Armed Forces were found to be complicit in the smuggling of gold by the Russians and it was raised with them.

ELBAGIR: Do you blame Russia for the death of democracy here in Sudan?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Definitely. Russia carries the majority of the blame for the still-birthing of Sudan's democracy.

ELBAGIR (voice-over): Just days later, his nephew was killed by state actors trying to stop a pro-democracy demonstration.

In the two weeks we've been in Sudan investigating Russia's illegal gold mining, 10 people were killed, protesting for change.

It's not just on the battlefields of Ukraine that Russia is spilling blood. Here too, there is a human cost. The cost of Russia's support of Sudan's generals in return for its gold.

Nima Elbagir, CNN -- Khartoum, Sudan.

(END VIDEOTAPE) KOSIK: CNN has reached out to the Russian foreign ministry, the Russian defense ministry and the parent organization for the group of companies run by Prigozhin for comment and received no response.

We also reached out to the offices of Sudanese military rulers and received no response to our request for comment.

U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a team of Democratic representatives will begin their trip to Asia in Singapore, but there's no mention of a potential stop in Taiwan yet. Over the course of two days, the delegation will meet with Singapore's president and prime minister along with cabinet members and business leaders.

CNN's Blake Essig joins us live from Tokyo with the latest.

So Blake, what is the likelihood that Pelosi will visit Taiwan but we won't hear about it until she leaves?

BLAKE ESSIG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Alison, I think that's it. I think that whether or not she visits Taiwan, nobody going to know about it until it happens or it doesn't happen.

What we do know right now is that the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has kicked off her tour of Asia. Singapore is the first of four planned stops according to a statement released by her office. That also includes Malaysia, South Korea and Japan.

Now, despite recent speculation that the speaker would be making a fifth stop in Taiwan, the statement made no mention of the self governed island.

[01:39:56]

ESSIG: That of course, doesn't mean that the rumored visit won't take place. In fact Admiral Mike Mullen, who visited Taiwan earlier this year with a delegation of former officials says that he thinks a surprise visit to Taiwan is in fact possible. Take a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ADM. MIKE MULLEN, FORMER JOINTS CHIEF CHAIRMAN: She's been there many, many times in that area of the world. She feels strongly about supporting the kinds of values that we stand for and working with our friends.

So again -- and Taiwan has been a friend for a long time and particularly in a bipartisan way. So it wouldn't surprise me if she went.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ESSIG: It's worth noting that the omission of Taiwan from the speaker's agenda falls in line with what we've seen before from other U.S. officials on visits to this part of the world.

Experts also point out that it's not exactly unusual that typically listing Taiwan on the itinerary or not listing Taiwan on the itinerary is consistent with the U.S. one China policy, which acknowledges Beijing's position that Taiwan is in fact a part of Taiwan (SIC).

Taiwan's premier was asked about a potential Pelosi visit earlier today. And as you might expect, he didn't exactly answer the question saying that Taipei warmly welcomes any foreign VIP friends to visit Taiwan and that the government will make appropriate arrangements to facilitate any visits by foreign guests.

Whether Pelosi visits Taiwan are not, tensions over the Taiwan straight have intensified with the simple prospect of her visiting absolutely enraging China. As a result, Beijing has vowed to respond, and some Chinese analysts, Alison, have suggested that that response could involve the military.

KOSIK: All right. Blake Essig, thanks so much for all of your reporting.

Just ahead, fires scorched Portugal and Italy as wind, drought and a heat wave add to the problems.

Plus nearly two weeks in the White House, an update on U.S. President Biden as he battles his rebound COVID case.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KOSIK: You're looking at a fire burning on the west coast of Portugal on Sunday. Authorities were forced to block several roads and evacuate a care home. Witnesses said the smoke was visible from Lisbon about 40 kilometers away. More than 1,000 firefighters are currently mobilized across Portugal.

Meantime, in Italy, firefighters continue battling blazes across the country. Italy is in the middle of its worst drought in 70 years.

For more on this story, let's get to Pedram Javaheri, he is at the weather center for us. Pedram, what are you learning?

PEDRAM JAVAHERI, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Alison, you know, it's been very hot, of course, for so many weeks. The drought situation continues to worsen across this region. There's a little bit of good news here at least in the southern tier of Europe, where it has been so hot and dry for a long period, but maybe a break here potentially in the coming several days.

[01:44:57]

JAVAHERI: But notice, of course, the dry landscape, the excessive temperatures, not just one or two degrees above average, but 5 to 7 degrees above average across an extensive area of south central Spain.

Those afternoon high temperatures on Sunday were -- they climbed up into the 40s. And what's incredible is just a few hundred kilometers towards the east of this region, it was raining quite heavy at times. Upwards of almost 90 millimeters of rainfall. Can you imagine if this was displaced over back toward the south and west? That would have been really beneficial in this region. Because statistically 15 millimeters of rainfall is what it takes to stop the spread of fires, and you kind of up that to about 50 millimeters, and you can actually extinguish some fires with that amount of rainfall. So there was enough rain just to the east, but unfortunately, not exactly where you need it.

Now, when it comes to Portugal, north and east of Portugal, we do have a high level of concern here for excessive heat with temps that touch 40 degrees yet again. Again that's locked in here in the south and west. But up towards the north, conditions have cooled off for now, but things are going to change.

When it comes to Lisbon, here we go, down to the upper twenties, possibly the mid twenties in the month of July. Out of 31 days, 23 of these days were above average in Lisbon. Looks like we're finally going to tap into a couple of those days sometime early next week.

But notice where that heat moves on from. From the southwest eventually off towards the north and east. So our friends across areas of Germany, areas of France into the Benelux region could tap into quite a bit of heat here for at least a day or two. And Berlin, case in point here, climbs to 34, up to 36 degrees. Looks like it'll be generally short lived. By this weekend, we do come right back down again with a few storms.

Today (INAUDIBLE) off towards the north. In London, only at 26 degrees while down towards Madrid touching 40 or so, and in Milan highs there around 36.

Alison, the broad picture here, the colors you want to look for, the purples, the oranges, the reds, if you see a lot of those, that means this area is in a fire risk and fire danger. Of course, higher relations and back towards the north and west, the low spots are of very low concern for fire right now.

But showing you the data here kind of input into these thermal signature of fires scattered about Europe and kind of pick your spot. Just about every region here has at least fires within their vicinity. So that's the concern in what has been a historically hot and dry summer across a large area of Europe, Alison.

KOSIK: Ok. Pedram Javaheri from the CNN Weather Center, thanks.

U.S. President Joe Biden is still testing positive after a rebound COVID case. The White House physician says the president continues to feel well as he isolates.

CNN White House reporter Kevin Liptak has more details.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: The White House Dr. Kevin O'Connor says that's not necessarily a surprise as he weathers this rebound infection that they are attributing to the anti viral drug Paxlovid.

And you do see a small percentage of patients who take that drug have an infection after they've tested negative. But the White House still says that it's helped kept his symptoms mild.

The White House doctor says that the president is feeling well today. So medically, the president certainly seems to be doing fine. And he told the group yesterday that he'd actually gone to the White House gym before this positive test.

But perhaps more troubling for the president is this isolation period. They've had to cancel a number of events that were slated to take place out of town. The president had hoped to go to his home in Delaware this weekend. That was canceled.

He was also supposed to travel to Michigan to tout some new legislation on Tuesday. That also had to be canceled. The president had hoped to go up yesterday to support some protesters at the U.S. Capitol. They're protesting some stalled legislation. He couldn't go because of that positive test.

But he did face time them from the Truman balcony here at the White House. He does have his dog here to keep him company, but it's hard to believe that he's not going a little stir crazy. It will now have been 11 days since he's left the White House.

Kevin Liptak, CNN -- the White House.

KOSIK: In California, the mayor of San Francisco has declared a public health emergency due to rising monkeypox cases. The declaration will expedite streamline resources to deal with the outbreak.

CNN's Camilla Bernal spoke with residents about growing fears around the virus and vaccine shortages.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We're seeing very similar measures in New York City and here in San Francisco, because both of these cities are seeing a rapid increase in the number of monkeypox cases.

Now, what this public health emergency does is release funding and resources for outreach, testing, vaccinations, and for treatment. That emergency went into effect immediately in New York City when it was announced on Saturday.

[01:49:52]

BERNAL: Here in San Francisco, it goes into effect on Monday. Mayor London Breed saying they just do not have enough vaccines. She says that they need about 70,000 doses of the vaccine and so far, they've only received about 12,000.

I've heard from a number of people here in San Francisco, some who do not even want to talk about monkeypox, others who say they don't feel like it's a big deal because it is not deadly. While others say they're very worried haven't been able to find a vaccine.

Here's what they told me.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just -- there's a lot of people now, since COVID is done, that are traveling, and interacting with other people, and just for my own self, I just would feel more comfortable with the vaccine.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just because it's, you know, moving so fast, and I'm on several different lists to get a vaccine, it's very difficult to get a vaccine.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BERNAL: And I talk to regular people and political leaders who say this feels like deja vu. They say they remember the AIDS crisis here in San Francisco, and they felt alone. They felt like they did not have help from the federal government, and they're hoping that the Biden administration does whatever they can to find vaccines and get them to the people that need them and want them.

Now, political leaders here in San Francisco also saying that it's important to remember that there are people here who are hurting both physically and emotionally. They say there are some with monkeypox that cannot speak, cannot go to the bathroom, because of the pain.

And they say that emotionally, people feel marginalized, they feel the stigma, and they feel the hate. Which is why some of the political leaders here in San Francisco say they will do anything to support the LGBTQ+ community here in San Francisco as they await for more vaccines.

Camilla Bernal, CNN -- San Francisco.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

KOSIK: Here's a look at how far the monkeypox outbreak has spread. Sudan reported its first case of the virus on Sunday, while the areas with the most cases are centered in the U.S. and Europe, according to data from the World Health Organization. The CDC says more than 22,000 cases have been reported in at least 79 countries so far.

Still to come, history was made in London on Sunday as England's women's team took home the Euro championship against Germany. The impact it's had on fans when we return.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KOSIK: Welcome back. I'm Alison Kosik.

England is celebrating a historic victory at the women's Euro Championship. Sunday night's game went into extra time before England won by a score of 2 to 1. It's their first major women's championship.

Amanda Davies has more on the emotional win from outside Wembley stadium.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT: What does football coming home feel like? It feels like this. It is passion. It is unity. It is England's women putting all those years of hurt to one side to lift that major piece of silverware.

There are so many people who have worked so hard to get to this moment. Not even, actually, for the trophy winning moment, just for the right to play on a level playing field. For 50 years, from 1921, football for women professionally, was banned here in England.

[01:54:57]

DAVIES: The last time England took on Germany in the European final in 2009, so many of the players were part time, having to take on other jobs to fund their footballing career.

But now, here we are, at Wembley, one of the most iconic stadiums in world football. They've sold it out, and not only done that. They have broken the record for attendance at a European championship, men and women.

Germany, for their part, do deserve a whole lot of credit, you really got to feel for Alex (INAUDIBLE) and her teammates. They go home distraught, but with their heads held high.

It was brilliant. Not always pretty, it was gritty, and it's England going home with the trophy.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's good that it finally came home after lots of like terrible like moments, but we finally, finally came home. Obviously, we are happy. Enjoyment, excitement -- everything. I love it.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is the first life football they see and they see England win at Wembley. I mean we'll probably be in football forever but it was amazing.

DAVIES: At England (INAUDIBLE) as Williamson put it "This is just the beginning."

The Lionesses and their fans as well, their roar is being heard loud and wild. It is now about keeping that message moving forward.

Amanda Davies, CNN -- Wembley.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

KOSIK: It's also a very good day to be a Formula 1 driver Max Verstappen. The Red Bull driver, came from behind to win Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix for a second straight victory. Verstappen started the race in tenth position due to issues from the qualifier, but rose the fairest busting seven-time world champion Luis Hamilton who came in second.

The next big race is the Belgian Grand Prix, set for August 28th.

Dutch cyclist Annemiek Van Vleuten (INAUDIBLE) has won the relaunched women's Tour D' France. The 39 year old finished nearly four minutes ahead of second place, earning her the prized yellow jersey. She won stages seven and eight and overcame a stomach bug and five bike changes. Wow.

The race covers more than 1000 kilometers in eastern France over eight five stages. This was the first women's Tour d' France since 1989.

Congratulations.

And thanks for watching CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Alison Kosik.

Production process

The main raw materials used in the manufacture of the products are carbon steel wire rod, zinc and plastic. The production process of the merchandise under examination consists of the following stages:

Pickling: the wire rod is cleaned to remove any scale and rust it may have. This pickling can be chemical, by immersing the wire rod in acid, or mechanical, by physically removing the scale and rust.

Surface coating: after the pickling process, the wire rod is coated with lubricants to prepare the rod surface for easier drawing.

Drawing: the drawing process consists of deforming the wire rod in cold, reducing its cross-sectional diameter by passing it through a conical hole made with a tool called a die. This reduction in cross-section gives the material certain mechanical properties such as strength and ductility.

Galvanizing (optional): the zinc coating on the surface of the wire and strand has both a mechanical protective effect and an electrochemical protective effect on the iron substrate, in addition to offering good corrosion resistance, this process is done by immersion galvanizing.

Braiding or Drawing: In the case of the 7-wire reinforcing product, braiding is done by placing the spools of wires (6 outer and 1 central wire) in the twisting machine, which is responsible for pulling the wires from each of the spools and winding or braiding them around the central wire by means of controlled speeds. In the case of the prestressing product formed by a wire, it is possible to carry out an embossing process. Once the wire is obtained, it is passed through embossing rollers that produce an imprint to achieve adherence between the prestressing wire and the concrete.

Stress relieving and low relaxation: the prestressing product must go through a thermomechanical process to eliminate residual stresses. In this stage, the prestressing products are heated to a temperature close to 400ºC and are simultaneously subjected to a tensile stress when passing from a piece rotating at a low speed to another piece with a higher speed, achieving a stretching or tensile stress. This results in a stabilization and increase of the elastic limit and ductility of the pre-strengthening product.

Plasticizing (optional): a layer of grease and a polyethylene coating (type of plastic) is applied to the prestressed product, which provides the prestressed product with greater protection against corrosion and mobility within the plastic.

Packaging: the coils or rolls of prestressed product, once the previous stages have been completed, are strapped in such a way that they are perfectly tensioned. If requested, the coil of prestressed product is coated with a layer of paper and a layer of plastic to provide extra protection and is strapped again.

Standards

National and international quality standards apply to prestressing products; national standards include: NMX-B-292-CANACERO-2011, on specifications and test methods for uncoated seven-wire strand with stress relief for prestressed concrete, and NMX-B-293-CANACERO-2012, on specifications and test methods for uncoated steel wire with stress relief for use in prestressed concrete. Internationally, the American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) standards ASTM-A-416M-06, on specifications for seven-wire uncoated steel strand for prestressed concrete, and ASTM-421M-05, on specifications for uncoated stress-relieved steel wire for prestressed concrete, apply.

Uses and functions

The main function of prestressing products is to increase the elasticity and resistance of the structures they form, whether prestressed or post-tensioned, preventing them from deforming under the action of external forces or loads, thus increasing their durability. It is mainly used in precast concrete structures of different sizes, as well as in the stay cables that are part of cable-stayed bridges. Some of these prefabricated structures or parts are joists, vaults, hollow core slabs, beams, deltas, concrete pipes, posts, prefabricated floor systems, among others. These structures, in turn, are used in bridges, airport runways, slope anchors, slabs for buildings and parking lots, dams, silos, industrial buildings, bridge stays, among others.

The Secretariat is competent to issue this Resolution, according to articles 16 and 34 sections V and XXXIII of the Organic Law of the Federal Public Administration; 1, 2, paragraph A, section II numeral 7, and 19 sections I and IV of the RISE; 11.1, 11.3, 11.4, 12.2 and 12.3 of the Antidumping Agreement, and 5 section VII, 67, 70 section II and 89 F of the LCE.

Applicable Legislation

For the purposes of this proceeding, the Antidumping Agreement, the LCE, the Regulations of the Foreign Trade Law (RLCE), the Federal Fiscal Code, the LFPCA applied on a supplementary basis, pursuant to the Second Transitory Article of the Decree issuing the LFPCA, as well as the Federal Code of Civil Procedures (CFPC), the latter three of supplementary application, are applicable.

Protection of confidential information

The Secretariat cannot publicly disclose the confidential information that the interested parties submitted, nor the confidential information that it itself obtained, in accordance with the provisions of articles 6.5 of the Antidumping Agreement, 80 of the LCE, and 152 and 158 of the RLCE.

Right of defense and due process

The interested parties had ample opportunity to present all kinds of arguments, exceptions and defenses, as well as the evidence to support them, in accordance with the Antidumping Agreement, the LCE and the RLCE. The Secretariat evaluated them in accordance with the essential formalities of the administrative procedure.

Response to certain arguments of the parties

Non-appearance of foreign producers and exporters

Deacero pointed out that the non-appearance of the producers and exporters to the proceeding of the investigated countries, not only implies not having the information and direct evidence of the export price, but also, not cooperating implies hindering the proceeding in progress. Likewise, in the absence of evidence to the contrary of the information and evidence provided, the authority must grant full evidentiary value to the presumption inferred, which implies a fictitious confession of the producers and exporters in terms of the provisions of article 201 of the CFPC, supplementary adjective ordinance of the LFPC and the LCE and that, in any case, it must be in accordance with the provisions of article 6.8 of the Antidumping Agreement and paragraph 7 of Annex II, since the fictitious confession of the facts produces a presumption (juris tantum) according to which the producers of those countries exported the product relevant to this review.

Camesa pointed out that it should be resolved adversely to the interests of the non-appearing parties, which, despite having had ample opportunity to promote in the present proceeding, demonstrate a lack of interest in it, which translates into a clear lack of cooperation, observing the intention expressed in the last sentence of paragraph 7 of Annex II of the Antidumping Agreement, in the sense that the cooperating party can expect a better result than the one it would have obtained if it had not cooperated, whose purpose is precisely to discourage "passive litigation" strategies or to benefit from the non-provision of information that is available to such parties.

The Secretariat considers that the arguments presented by the national producers with respect to the non appearance of the exporters in the present proceeding are inadmissible for the following reasons:

the requirements are not met in order to apply the legal provisions that the domestic producers invoke in a supplementary manner. In the opinion of the Secretariat, the domestic producers lose sight of the fact that, as stated in the judicial criterion "SUPPLETORITY OF LAWS. REQUIREMENTS FOR IT TO OPERATE" (registry 200316)), in order for the supplementation to operate it is necessary that the following requirements are met: a) that the law to be supplemented does not contemplate the institution or the legal issues that are intended to be applied or that, establishing them, they are regulated in a deficient manner, and that such omission or void makes necessary the supplementary application of rules to solve the problem, and b) that the applicable rules do not contravene the law that is to be supplemented;

Regarding the legal figure of the fictitious confession, the Secretariat considers that it is not applicable in the investigation procedures in the matter of unfair international trade practices, which makes it unnecessary for such figure to be applied in a supplementary manner in order to solve the legal problem raised. This is due to the fact that the specific normative framework applicable to the investigation procedures of merit, adequately and sufficiently provides the figure that must be used in the absence of information, which is considered optimal.

lack of information, which is considered optimal for such purpose, caused by the absence of any of the interested parties, which is the use of the best information available (also referred to as "the facts available"). Therefore, in the absence of counterparts, the application of the fictitious confession does not operate, but the use of the best information available; consequently, the supplementation alleged by the domestic producers lacks support;

the litis of this proceeding was configured through the publication in the DOF of the Determination of Initiation, since the circumstances set forth in articles 11.3 of the Antidumping Agreement, 70 section ll and 70 B of the LCE, therefore, the non-appearance of the producers, exporters and importers of pre-stressed products subject of this review, as well as of the governments of China, Spain and Portugal, is not necessary for this Secretariat to determine, based on the integral analysis of the information and evidence contained in the administrative record of the case, whether the elimination of the antidumping duties indicated in paragraph 1 of this Determination would continue or repeat the unfair practice, and

therefore, the lack of cooperation of any of the parties in the proceedings on unfair international trade practices does not necessarily justify the inference of unfavorable conclusions for them, since the use of the facts of which there is knowledge provided for in Article 6.8 and paragraph 7 of Annex II of the Antidumping Agreement is not intended to punish the parties that do not provide information, or to reward those who have provided it, nor does it entail the authority's power to draw inferences of unfavorable or less favorable conclusions or that its determinations lack de jure and de facto basis to apply a sanction, due to the fact of not appearing to the proceeding and failing to provide relevant information, but rather its objective is to be able to continue with the proceeding in order to make the corresponding determination. In this sense, as noted by the Panel in the Mexico - Definitive Antidumping Measures on Beef and Rice dispute, in paragraph 7.238 of its report, it is clear that the lack of cooperation of a party could lead to a less favorable result than if it had cooperated, but it does not imply a sanctioning power or a predetermined result in that sense.

Analysis of continuation or recurrence of dumping

In the present proceeding, there was no information from the exporting producers of the examined merchandise, nor from the governments of China, Spain and Portugal. Therefore, the Secretariat carried out the examination on the continuation or recurrence of dumping based on the information and evidence provided by the national producers Camesa and Deacero, CANACERO, as well as the information that the Secretariat obtained, in terms of the provisions of articles 6.8, Annex II of the Antidumping Agreement, 54 second paragraph and 64 last paragraph of the LCE.

Export Price

At Deacero's request, CANACERO submitted a database with the import operations that entered through the tariff sections 7217.10.99, 7312.10.01, 7312.10.05, 7312.10.07, 7312.10.08, 7312.10.10 and 7312.10.99 of the TIGIE, which it obtained from the Servicio de Administración Tributaria (SAT), as well as the methodology to identify the imports corresponding to the product under examination originating in China, Spain and Portugal. Regarding the methodology, it considered the following criteria:

identified the import operations carried out in the period of examination;

classified as "Considered" the order codes A1, AF, C1, F3, G1 and IN because they imply an entry of foreign merchandise into the country under a definitive or temporary regime, and as "Not Considered" the order codes A3, A4, AD, BA, BH, BO, C3, D1, F2, F4, F5, G9, H1, K1, P1, V1, V5 because they do not imply a real entry of foreign merchandise into the country;

identified the import operations originating in the investigated countries; and

based on the description of the product, classified as product under examination "POE" the operations that coincide with "Presfuerzo", "Pretensado", "Post-tensado", as well as other similar names, and as product not under examination "PNOE" to different products or with a generic description that makes it impossible to determine if the product is the one under examination.

The Secretariat requested CANACERO to explain why it considered certain imports from Spain as a product not under examination. In this regard, it indicated that some of these imports correspond to pre-stressed products according to the importer's line of business, so it provided again the database where it included the operations as a product under examination.

Based on the information provided by CANACERO, Deacero and Camesa indicated that, for the tariff sections 7217.10.99, 7312.10.01, 7312.10.05, 7312.10.07, 7312.10.08, 7312.10.10 and 7312.10.99 of the TIGIE, there were no imports of pre-stressing products from China and Portugal, only from Spain, during the period of examination.

Therefore, to prove the export price for Spain, Deacero and Camesa considered the imports database and the methodology to identify the product under examination provided by CANACERO. For China and Portugal they estimated an export price for each country, based on the imports made by Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Colombia originating from each investigated country, reported by the Penta-Transaction system for the tariff subheadings 7217.10 and 7312.10, during the period of examination. They submitted screenshots of the queries made in the Penta-Transaction system and the reports of the imports made by each importing country.

Deacero and Camesa stated that the Penta-Transaction system database, which is consulted online, is a service that provides statistical information on exports and imports and allows the identification of the operations corresponding to the product under examination.

In order to identify the merchandise under examination originating in China and Portugal in the Penta-Transaction system, Deacero and Camesa considered the following criteria:

for tariff subheading 7217.10 they considered those descriptions that corresponded to wire. For subheading 7312.10 they identified the descriptions referring to wire ropes, steel wire ropes, stranded wire, stranded steel wire or common terms such as cord, rope, stranded steel wire, stranded metal wire, stranded steel coil, twine, stranded steel wire, steel wire, stranded steel wire and cable wire; prestressed concrete wire or strand (PC) and A416 which refers to the standard applicable to its manufacture, and

excluded operations with descriptions other than that of the merchandise examined, such as: annealed, welding, steel core, general use, industrial use, for mattresses, for springs, for mesh, automotive, for oil tankers, stainless, bronze coated, among others. They also excluded those descriptions of merchandise that incorporate parts, pieces, sets, accessories, assemblies and components.

To support the methodology, they presented lists of product descriptions where each description of merchandise is identified, identifying if they correspond or not to the product under examination, as well as their corresponding justification.

Derived from the information reported by the Penta-Transaction system, the Secretariat observed that the volumes exported by China and Portugal to Latin American countries do not correspond with the volumes imported by such countries, so they were requested to clarify this situation. Deacero and Camesa clarified that the Penta-Transaction system reports a difference of 4.1% between the volume exported by Portugal and China and the imports made by Latin American countries. They provided a letter on letterhead signed by the Mexico Commercial Director of the Penta-Transaction system, addressed to Camesa, indicating that the statistics reported in the Penta-Transaction system are published as the countries report them, which are taken from the different customs offices or the agency responsible for issuing them, and are updated on a monthly basis. It is also noted that a factor that explains the difference is that the information includes operations of both the general and temporary regime, and some of these operations may not have been subtracted at the time of the consultation, so in the opinion of Penta-Transaction, it would be favorable to consider the information from the importing country.

Likewise, the Secretariat requested Deacero and Camesa to explain the elements that led it to consider the Latin American region for the calculation of the export price, since said region as a whole represents 5.94% of the exports from China and Portugal to the whole world in the period under review, according to the information reported by the Penta-Transaction system. They explained that the trade of pre-strengthening products in the international market responds to different competition conditions that affect the price offered by the exporting countries, being the import prices of the Latin American region the ones that could have been offered to the Mexican market.

In addition to the above, they presented a table prepared with information reported by the Penta-Transaction system that summarizes the exports from China and Portugal for the tariff subheadings 7217.10 and 7312.10 in 2020, grouped by region, where it is observed that the demand for merchandise is concentrated in the countries of destination with greater proximity to the exporting countries.

Deacero explained that importing companies are motivated to acquire the merchandise from the supplier that offers them more competitive conditions and opportunity, being the closest domestic and foreign producers, the ones that meet these expectations due to the arrival time, freight cost and price offered. It added that, given the level of trade of the Latin American countries, it considered that a different price formation would prevail in said region, being these the most probable ones that would explain the price behavior of the exporters in the region.

The Secretariat requested Deacero and Camesa to provide information on export operations from China and Portugal to the world during the period under review. In response, they indicated that they reviewed the exports from both countries reported by the Penta-Transaction system, related to the tariff subheadings 7217.10 and 7312.10, for the period of examination, however, the information indicated in the product description fields is generic and does not allow the identification of the product under examination, therefore, they presented the estimation of the export price based on the imports made by the main countries of destination originating in China and Portugal, made by the tariff subheadings 7217.10 and 7312.10, during the period of examination, based on the information reported by the Penta-Transaction system.

To estimate the export price for China based on the imports from the main countries of destination of the imported merchandise, Deacero and Camesa considered the countries that represented 90% of the volume of Chinese exports during the period of examination, however, for some countries the import statistics were not available. To estimate the export price for Portugal, they considered the countries that accounted for 80% of the exported volume, for the same period. To support the above, they provided screenshots of the consultations made in the Penta-Transaction system, the list of the countries of destination of exports originating in China and Portugal, and the list of the countries of destination of the exports originating in the United States of America.the reports of the imports made by importing country.

In order to identify if the imported merchandise, originating in China and Portugal, corresponds to pre-stress products, Deacero and Camesa considered the criteria and documents indicated in points 48 and 49 of this Resolution.

From the above analysis, they identified Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Kenya, Pakistan and Peru as importers of pre-stressed products from China. They clarified that they did not consider imports from Pakistan because the Penta-Transaction system did not report information on the value of the operations of that country. In the case of Portugal, they identified Brazil, the United States, and Peru as importers of pre-strengthening products originating in that country.

According to the Penta-Transaction system, the volume imported is mainly reported in kilograms or tons, with some operations from Vietnam being reported in meters. To convert meters to kilograms, Deacero and Camesa provided an approximation of the weight per meter based on a proportionality factor according to Camesa's own information. This is due to the fact that they do not have a conversion factor from meters to kilograms for the type of pre-strengthening product. They presented Camesa's worksheet and product catalog.

Likewise, in the Penta-Transaction system, prices are reported in U.S. dollars, except for the case of Kenya, which are reported in kes (Kenyan shilling), so they provided the exchange rate to U.S. dollars that they obtained from the Central Bank of Kenya, information corroborated by the Secretariat.

Derived from the above, Deacero and Camesa estimated an export price in dollars per metric ton for China and another one for Portugal, considering the reinforcing wire and reinforcing strand, during the examination period.

Deacero pointed out that the information from Penta-Transaction, although expressed at six digits, represents the best information available to identify an export price of the product under review for China and Portugal, since it corresponds to the product under review, it is within the period examined and it was adjusted to express them at ex-factory level.

It added that the information and evidence presented are those that were legally and reasonably available to it, and that the direct, accurate and relevant information and evidence related to the export price are in the possession of the producers of China and Portugal.

Therefore, the Secretariat required Deacero and Camesa to decide on one of the export price proposals for China and Portugal, i.e., based on imports from Latin American countries, or based on imports from the main destination countries. Also, to provide a supporting explanation for their selection, in order to prove the continuation or recurrence of dumping.

Deacero and Camesa stated that the export price proposal based on the imports of the main destination countries is the most appropriate and relevant, considering that the Latin American region imported 5.94% of the exports from China and Portugal, which implied obtaining export price information based on such marginal participation of the region. Camesa added that, based on the proposal of imports to the main countries of destination, the export price for China and Portugal was calculated with a higher volume of pre-strengthening products, being that such volumes include import operations from Latin American countries located among the countries with the highest volume exported by China.

On the other hand, the Secretariat obtained the import statistics reported by the Commercial Information System of Mexico (SIC-M) that entered through the tariff fractions 7217.10.99, 7312.10.01, 7312.10.05, 7312.10.07, 7312.10.08, 7312.10.10, 7312.10.10 and 7312.10.99 of the TIGIE, originating from China, Spain and Portugal, during the period of examination and requested to customs agents the import pedimentos and their attached documentation, corresponding to imports originating from said countries, during the period of examination. Non-party importers were also requested to identify if the imported products correspond to the product under examination. The information obtained represented for the three countries more than 90% of the volume requested.

As a result of the information obtained from importers and customs agents, the Secretariat corroborated that, during the period of examination, there were no imports of pre-stressed products originating from China and Portugal, being that only the product under examination was imported from Spain. In this regard, the Secretariat compared the information provided with the results obtained by CANACERO, regarding the product description, volume, customs value in dollars and number of operations, without finding differences. It should be noted that the import operations originating in Spain correspond only to pre-stressed stranded wire.

Consequently, for the calculation of the export price for Spain, the Secretariat determined to consider the SIC-M database and the information provided by importers and customs agents, since the information contained in the database is obtained after validation of the customs pedimentos that occur in a framework of exchange of information between customs agents and agents, on the one hand, and the customs authority on the other, which is reviewed by the Bank of Mexico and, therefore, is considered as the best information available.

For China and Portugal, the Secretariat determined to accept the export price proposal based on the imports from the main countries of destination reported by the Penta-Transaction system, for the tariff subheadings 7217.10 and 7312.10, submitted by Deacero and Camesa, because such proposal contemplates in its analysis a high percentage of the volume exported by China and Portugal to the world, being that it is not restricted to a single region, besides, the Penta-Transaction system allows identifying the operations corresponding to the product under examination.

Determination

Based on articles 6.8, Annex II of the AA, 54 second paragraph, 64 last paragraph of the LCE, 39 and 40 of the RLCE, the Secretariat calculated the weighted average export price for each country in dollars per ton for the period under review. For Spain it considered in its calculation the pre-stressing strand, and for China and Portugal the two types of pre-stressing products identified as wire and strand.

Adjustments to the export price

Spain

Deacero and Camesa proposed adjusting the export price for maritime freight and insurance, since for the calculation of the export price they considered the customs value of imports.

They clarified that they did not adjust for internal freight, because the Spanish company TYCSA, manufacturer of pre-stressed products, is located a short distance from the port of Santander, Spain. As documentary support, they submitted screenshots of the Google Maps website showing the location of the producer and indicating that the distance to the port of shipment is 4.3 km, information that was corroborated by the Secretariat in the Google Maps website.

According to the information provided by Deacero and Camesa, TYCSA is the largest European manufacturer of high yield strength steel wire and strands for construction, and the company with the largest presence in the international market.

(1) Ocean freight and insurance

Deacero and Camesa used the World Freight Rates web page to estimate the adjustments for maritime freight and insurance in Spain. In order to determine the amount of the merchandise that is consigned in such Internet page, they considered the unit value of the imports to Mexico of pre-strengthening products originating in Spain, carried out during the period of examination.

From this, they calculated the cost in dollars per ton for maritime transportation from the port of Santander, Spain, to the port of Altamira, Mexico, for a 20-foot container, considering an average load of 20 tons. The ocean freight cost includes cargo insurance.

The cost for maritime freight and insurance is outside the examination period, therefore, to bring it to the examined period, Deacero and Camesa adjusted it according to the consumer price index of Spain, published by the Bank of Spain. The Secretariat corroborated the consumer price index on the Bank of Spain's website.

Camesa indicated that the World Freight Rates website is a reasonable basis for the adjustments made, since this website is owned by a company with 30 years of experience in the logistics and transportation industry. In addition, the calculator allows obtaining current freight rates worldwide. To support the above, it provided information obtained from the World Freight Rates web page, information that was verified by the Secretariat when consulting such web page.

To support that the capacity of a 20-foot container corresponds to 20 tons of the merchandise under examination, Deacero and Camesa provided an international cargo manifest corresponding to five 20-foot containers, where it is indicated that the net weight is 101,966 kilograms, therefore it is estimated that the net weight per container is 20,393 kilograms, which demonstrates the relevance of considering the capacity of a 20-foot container equivalent to 20 tons. They also provided the web page www.aduanet.gob.pe/servlet[http://www.aduanet.gob.pe/servlet] from where the international cargo manifest was obtained. The Secretariat accessed the web page and corroborated that the international cargo manifest corresponds to the transportation of pre-stressed products, as well as the net weight of the containers.

In addition to the above, Camesa provided an electronic communication from its logistics department, which indicates that shipments are regularly handled between 20 and 22 tons with tare, being determined by the supplier that the tare of a 20-foot container is 2,200 kilograms, so that the estimated net weight of the largest volume range is estimated at 19.80 tons. To support the above, it presented the Internet page of the company ONE, which offers container transportation services. The Secretariat accessed this website and confirmed the information.

China

The Penta-Transaction system reports the import prices of Vietnam at FOB, cost and freight (CFR), CIF, DAF and DDU level; the import prices of Thailand, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Kenya are at CIF level and the import prices of Peru are at FOB level. Therefore, the national production proposed to adjust the export price for maritime freight and insurance and for internal freight and maneuvers, as appropriate.

(1) Ocean freight and insurance

To estimate the adjustments for maritime freight and insurance from China to Vietnam, Deacero and Camesa considered as point of origin the ports of Tianjin, Qingdao and Tianjin Xingang, China and as point of destination the port of Cang Cat Lai, in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. They clarified that the imports made with DAF sales term were not adjusted for maritime freight and insurance because such imports were made by land, according to the information reported by the Penta-Transaction system.

For Thailand, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Kenya, they considered as point of origin the city of Tianjin, China and as point of destination the ports of Bangkok, Thailand, Jakarta, Indonesia, Chittagong, Bangladesh and Mombasa, Kenya, respectively, because these ports are economic and commercial centers or are the main ports of entry.

Deacero and Camesa indicated that it was not possible to obtain information on sea freight from the ports of origin to the ports of destination mentioned above, so they proposed the following methodology:

they obtained the maritime distance in nautical miles from the port of departure in China to the port of destination in each importing country. In order to obtain a distance in kilometers, they multiplied the distance in nautical miles by the conversion factor to kilometers;

presented two quotations showing ocean freight rates in dollars per 20-foot container from Qingdao, China to Manzanillo, Mexico; based on this, they obtained a cost per ocean freight in dollars per kilometer. To obtain this cost they divided the average ocean freight rate by the calculated distance in kilometers from the port of Qingdao to the port of Manzanillo. The quotations are within the examination period, since they correspond to the months of January and December 2020;

the ocean freight cost in dollars per kilometer obtained in the previous paragraph was multiplied by the distance in kilometers from the port of departure in China to the port of destination in each importing country;

to obtain the ocean freight cost in dollars per ton from the port of departure in China to the port of destination in each importing country, they considered the capacity of a 20-foot container, with an average load of 20 tons, and

for the cost of maritime insurance of the merchandise, they considered the percentage for such concept indicated in the quotations for maritime transportation, since they did not have information related to the maritime insurance in the ports of shipment from China to the importing countries.

To support the above methodology, they provided the worksheets, the quotations for maritime transportation, the consultations made in the Internet pages of clasicc.searoutes.com and Ports.com to obtain the maritime distance in nautical miles from the port of departure in China to the port of destination in each importing country, and the Internet page https://multi-converter.com[https://multi-converter.com] to obtain the conversion factor from nautical miles to kilometers, information that was corroborated by the Secretariat in the respective Internet pages.

Deacero and Camesa stated that the proposal to consider the cost for maritime transportation in dollars per kilometer that they obtained from the maritime freight rates from China to Mexico, is an appropriate and reliable methodology because it is based on objective and verifiable parameters, besides being the information they had available, since they were quotations in port in China for the transportation of the product under examination in 20 feet dry cargo containers. The Secretariat considers that the information and methodology of the national production are reasonable, since they correspond to an estimate of the cost for maritime transportation of pre-stressed products in dollars per kilometer for a 20 feet container, during the period of examination.

To support that the capacity of a 20-foot container corresponds to 20 tons of the merchandise examined, Deacero and Camesa provided the international cargo manifest and the electronic communication from Camesa's logistics department indicated in paragraphs 77 and 78 of this Resolution.

(2) Internal freight and handling

To support the adjustments for internal freight and maneuvers in China, Deacero and Camesa submitted a quotation from a transportation company corresponding to general cargo, from the Port of Tianjin, China to the company Silvery Dragon, manufacturer of the product under review. They explained that said port is the closest to the producing company, according to the information obtained from Google Maps, information that was corroborated by the Secretariat.

The costs for internal freight and maneuvers are expressed in U.S. dollars. To estimate the average costs in dollars per ton, they considered a standard 20-foot container, with an average load of 20 tons.

The costs for internal freight and handling are outside the period of examination, so, to bring them to the period under examination, they adjusted them according to the consumer price index of China, published by the Bank of China. The Secretariat corroborated the consumer price index on the Bank of China's website.

At the Secretariat's request, Deacero and Camesa provided the website of the producer company, which indicates that the company Silvery Dragon, has 40 years of experience and specializes in the manufacture of prestressed concrete products, in addition to being the largest producer of prestressed concrete steel in the world, information that was corroborated by the Secretariat.

Likewise, Deacero and Camesa submitted, at the request of the Secretariat, the website of the transportation company, where it is stated that it was founded in Hamburg, Germany in 1984 and has numerous branches around the world. The transportation company specializes mainly in cargo, shipments and international logistics, information that was corroborated by the Secretariat in the Internet page of the transportation company.

The Secretariat required Deacero and Camesa to justify why the quotation considered for the reference adjustments is applicable to the transportation of pre-strengthening products, since the quotation corresponds to the transportation of general cargo. In this regard, they pointed out that the quotation indicates as destination address, the one corresponding to a company producing the merchandise under examination in China, reason for which it considers that such quotation is an adequate evidence and can be used to make the adjustments for internal freight and maneuvers. The Secretariat considers that the quotation of the transportation company should be considered to estimate the adjustments for internal freight and maneuvers in China, since it corresponds to the transportation of merchandise to a company that produces pre-stressed products in China and which corresponds to one of the main producers of the product under examination in the world.

On the other hand, regarding the imports from Vietnam originating in China with DAF sales term, Deacero and Camesa adjusted them for internal freight and maneuvers because such imports were made by land, according to the Penta-Transaction system. For this purpose, they used the following methodology:

in the Penta-Transaction system they identified that the merchandise imported under said sales term,enters Vietnam mainly through the Dong Dang border customs office in Lang Son province, Vietnam. The point of origin is reported to be Pingxiang City, China;

from Google Maps they obtained the distance in kilometers from the port of Tianjin, China to the company Silvery Dragon, producer of pre-stressed products, whose address is indicated in the quotation of the transportation company indicated in point 86 of this Final Determination;

the cost for internal freight and maneuvers in dollars per ton from the port of Tianjin to the producing company was obtained through the methodology described in points 86 to 88 of this Resolution, and divided it by the distance in kilometers from the port to the producing company;

from Google Maps they obtained the distance in kilometers from the border customs office of Dong Dang, Vietnam to the city of Pingxiang, China, point of origin of the imports of prestressing products;

the distance obtained was multiplied by the cost of inland freight and handling in dollars per ton to obtain the cost in dollars per ton of inland freight and handling from the point of origin in China to the border in Vietnam, and

considered the capacity of a 20-foot container, with an average load of 20 tons.

To support the aforementioned methodology, they provided the worksheet where they estimated such adjustment and the consultations made to the Google Maps website to support the distance in kilometers, information that was corroborated by the Secretariat.

In order to support that the capacity of a 20 feet container corresponds to 20 tons of the examined merchandise, Deacero and Camesa provided the international cargo manifest and the electronic communication of the logistics department of Camesa indicated in points 77 and 78 of this Resolution.

iii. Portugal

The Penta-Transaction system reports the import prices from Brazil at CIF and CFR level. This database also reports the cost for maritime freight and insurance, so the national production subtracted from the invoice value the corresponding amount for freight and/or insurance, as appropriate, in order to obtain a value of imports at FOB level. On the other hand, the import prices of the United States and Peru are at FOB level. Therefore, Deacero and Camesa proposed to adjust the export price for internal freight and handling.

(1) Inland freight and handling

To support the adjustments for internal freight and handling in Portugal, Deacero and Camesa submitted a quotation from a carrier company corresponding to general cargo, from the Port of Aveiro, Portugal to the company Fapricela, manufacturer of the product under review. They explained that said port is one of the main cargo ports in that country, being the closest to the producing company, according to the information obtained from Clearcust and Google Maps websites, information that was corroborated by the Secretariat in said websites.

The costs for internal freight and maneuvers are expressed in US dollars. To estimate the average costs in dollars per ton, they considered a standard 20-foot container, with an average load of 20 tons.

The costs for internal freight and maneuvering are outside the period of examination, so to bring them to the period under examination they were adjusted according to the consumer price index of Portugal, published by the Bank of Portugal. The Secretariat corroborated the consumer price index on the Bank of Portugal's website.

According to the information provided by Deacero and Camesa, Fapricela is one of the largest steel producers in Europe and is the main producer of low relaxation steel strand. Its products include wires and pre-strengthening strand. The Secretariat corroborated on the company's website that Fapricela is the first company in Portugal to produce low relaxation pre- and post-tensioning strand.

At the Secretariat's request, Deacero and Camesa submitted the carrier company's website, which states that it was founded in Hamburg, Germany in 1984 and has numerous branches around the world. The transportation company specializes mainly in cargo, shipments and international logistics, information that was corroborated by the Secretariat.

The Secretariat required Deacero and Camesa to justify why the quotation considered for the reference adjustments was applicable to the transportation of pre-strengthening products, since the quotation corresponds to the transportation of general cargo. In this regard, they pointed out that the quotation indicates as destination address the one corresponding to a company producing the merchandise under examination in Portugal, reason why they consider that such quotation is an adequate evidence and can be used to make the adjustments for internal freight and maneuvers. The Secretariat considers that the quotation of the transportation company should be considered to estimate the adjustments for internal freight and handling in Portugal, since it corresponds to the transportation of merchandise to a company that produces reinforcement products in Portugal and which corresponds to the main producer of the product under examination in that country.

To support that the capacity of a 20 feet container corresponds to 20 tons of the merchandise under examination, Deacero and Camesa provided the international cargo manifest and the electronic communication of the logistics department of Camesa indicated in points 77 and 78 of this Resolution.

Determination

In accordance with articles 2.4 of the Antidumping Agreement, 36 of the LCE and 53, 54 and 58 of the RLCE, in the case of Spain, the Secretariat adjusted the export price for maritime freight and insurance. In the case of China, the Secretariat adjusted the export price for maritime freight and insurance, as well as for internal freight and maneuvers. For Portugal, the export price was adjusted for domestic freight and handling. The above, according to the information and methodology presented by Deacero and Camesa.

Normal value

Spain and Portugal

In order to prove the normal value, Deacero submitted the market study of Spain and Portugal prepared by the consulting firm UNO International Trade Strategy (UNO consulting firm). For its part, Camesa stated that it endorses such study and adheres to the information provided by Deacero.

The market study includes price quotations for prestressing wire and reinforcing bars from the producers TYCSA and Pretensados del Norte S.L, ("Pretensados del Norte"), in Spain, and from the producer Fapricela in Portugal. Prices are reported in euros and U.S. dollars per metric ton at ex factory level.

The price references are outside the examination period, therefore, to bring them to the period under examination, Deacero and Camesa adjusted them according to the consumer price index of Spain and Portugal, respectively, published by the Bank of Spain and the Bank of Portugal. The Secretariat corroborated the consumer price index on the websites of the Bank of Spain and the Bank of Portugal.

According to the market study, the prices of the pre-stressing products of the producing companies correspond to prices in the domestic market of Spain and Portugal. However, the Secretariat observed that from the reading of the price quotations it is not specified that they correspond to the domestic market of those countries, so Deacero and Camesa were requested to clarify this aspect. The Secretariat also requested Deacero and Camesa to submit the written response to the request for price quotations of prestressing products from Pretensados del Norte, since it was not included in the market study.

In this regard, Deacero provided electronic communications where the consultant stated that the prices of the producing companies are the prices quoted by the national producer in their respective markets. In such electronic communications, he also confirmed that the prices are at the ex-factory level. Regarding the prices of the company Pretensados del Norte, Deacero submitted e-mails where the consultant indicates that he does not have the response e-mail, which was deleted and has not been able to recover it.

From the above, the Secretariat clarifies that it determined not to consider the prices of the company Pretensados del Norte in the calculation of the normal value for Spain, due to the fact that, not having the written response, it could not validate the origin of the price information of said company, provided in the market study. For the rest of the quotations, the Secretariat accepted to consider them, because, according to the information in the administrative file, they correspond to sales price references in the domestic market of Spain and Portugal, respectively.

According to the information provided by Deacero, the consulting firm UNO, based in Washington, D.C., is an economic consulting firm that specializes in trade remedies, in addition, the consultants have more than fifteen years of experience in handling trade remedy matters, for such purpose, it submitted the consultants' profile. The Secretariat accessed the consultant's website and corroborated that the consulting firm UNO is a multidisciplinary consulting firm specialized in providing advice on trade barriers, with experience in iron and steel products, among others, also verified the profiles of the consultants who prepared the market study.

Deacero and Camesa argued that the internal price references in Spain and Portugal are a reasonable basis to determine the normal value, because:

they come from quotations of the manufacturers in Portugal and Spain, being that Fapricela and TYCSA have a market share that makes them representative in their respective countries;

include reinforcing wire and stranded wire in different diameters, the only two types of merchandise under examination; and

reflect the prices of the domestic market of the country of origin, in accordance with the production profiles of the companies in their respective markets.

Determination

Based on articles 2.1 of the Antidumping Agreement, 31 of the LCE, 39 and 58 of the RLCE, the Secretariat accepted the information contained in the market study of Spain and Portugal for the purpose of calculating the price at which the pre-stressed products are sold for consumption in the domestic market in Spain and Portugal.

In the case of Spain, the Secretariat considered only the internal price references of TYCSA and calculated an average price in dollars per ton for the reinforcing steel strand, comparable product for Spain as indicated in paragraph 69 of this Resolution. For Portugal, it calculated an average price in dollars per ton for each of the two types of the reinforcing steel product, i.e., wire and strand, based on the internal price references of the company Fapricela.

China

Deacero and Camesa stated that non-market economy conditions prevail in China. They emphasized that the steel sector, of which the reinforcing steel products industry is a part, is influenced and benefited by government policies that promote the increase of its productive capacities, which facilitates access to inputs with prices below market value and boosts its exports.

To support the above, Deacero and Camesa submitted a study of the manufacture of pre-stressed products in China where it is pointed out that cost and price structures prevail that are not determined according to market principles, prepared by Deacero, with the following arguments and evidence at a macroeconomic level, industrial sector and, specifically, of pre-stressed products, according to the criteria contained in article 48 of the RLCE.

Deacero and Camesa argued that, based on Articles 6 and 7 of the Chinese Constitution, as well as the General Program of the Constitution of the Communist Party, China will be in the primary stage of socialism for a long time. The basis of China's socialist economic system is socialist public ownership of the means of production.

Moreover, that in the European Commission's document "Significant Distortions in the Chinese Economy" (SWD/2017) 483 final/2, dated December 20, 2017, (the "European Commission Document"), it is noted that the form of governmental organization in China has a socialist economy structure, where state ownership is the main force of the economy and, when it comes to the private economy, the state does not merely encourage and support it, but guides it. Moreover, the economic system gives the State and the Communist Party a decisive role in the economy.

According to the document indicated in the previous point, the basic features of the socialist economy are a dominant state ownership, which the State and the Communist Party wish to strengthen and expand, a broad and sophisticated economic planning system, and an interventionist government policy in the economy, to implement the plans by using a wide range of tools, including catalog guidance, investment screening and financial incentives, among others, leading to non-market-based allocations of resources, and the creation of overcapacities in many sectors.

That the currency of the country under investigation is widely convertible in international currency markets.

They argue that the Chinese government's intervention in the exchange rate makes the currency not widely convertible. In the Annual Report on Exchange Rates and Exchange Rate Restrictions published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the restrictions are classified into 12 categories: i. capital transactions; ii. capital market instruments; iii. money market instruments; iv. collective investment securities; v. derivatives; vi. trade credits; vii. trade credit; viii. derivatives; vi. trade credits; vii. financial credits; viii. guarantees and similar instruments; ix. direct investments; x. liquidation of foreign investments; xi. real estate transactions; and xii. personal capital transactions, of which the Chinese government continues to maintain restrictions on most.

The Financial Times' "China's Capital Controls Dent Inbound Investment," published on April 17, 2017, notes that Beijing began cracking down on outbound investment and preventing companies from remitting capital abroad in an attempt to preserve its rapidly deteriorating foreign reserves.

According to The Hindu Business Line's "The Conflicting Saga of China's Exchange Rate" published on September 11, 2018, for the period 2007 to 2018, there is a gap between the real versus nominal exchange rate. In particular, in the short term, the authorities have appreciated their local currency, but in such a way, that the nominal exchange rate remains significantly separated from the real exchange rate.

The Chinese government's intervention in its foreign exchange markets is latent and fully visible, based on the fact that the convertibility of its currency is limited for certain purposes, such as financial transactions. As documentary support, they presented the report "Inquiry into the Status of the People's Republic of China as a Nonmarket Economy Country Under the Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Laws", published by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI).

The IMF's report on China, "IMF Country Report No. 18/240" states that China's monetary reforms have been insufficient and that in general the renminbi (RMB) remained stable against the basket published by the China Foreign Exchange Trading System (CFETS), but with a greater fluctuation compared to the dollar, and has appreciated by around 2% in real terms. For the IMF, these movements should be contextualized in a situation in which "the current account surplus continued to decline, but reflecting distortions and gaps in policies that encourage excessive savings".

Deacero and Camesa concluded that the exchange rate with respect to the US dollar is controlled by the State, through a dual exchange rate mechanism and the centralized fixing of currency floating bands, with an effective exchange of foreign currency only through and to the extent fixed by the official bank.

Wages should be established through free negotiation between workers and employers.

Deacero and Camesa point out that, when analyzing the Chinese labor market in general, there is a partisan control of unions and labor laws. Wages lag behind productivity, labor courts are in practice inaccessible, according to international observers, Chinese workers cannot choose their association, collective bargaining and strike action are prohibited, and the hukou system ties workers to pre-established zones, i.e., there is control over labor migration.

The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) has pointed out that in China workers' rights and wage bargaining power are extremely limited, as they do not have the right to organize into independent unions.

ICEX Spain Export and Investment indicated that there is only one recognized workers' organization in China, the government-controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU). Any independent trade union organization is illegal. The various trade unions in the companies depend on this organization, in addition, it has not ratified any of the conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO) regarding freedom of association and collective bargaining.

Some of the conventions that China has not ratified with the ILO according to the ILO website are on forced labor, freedom of association and protection of the right to organize, the right to organize and collective bargaining, the abolition of forced labor and the right to organize and collective bargaining, and the abolition of forced labor.labor inspection, among others.

The article "China's Hukou System at 60: Continuity and Reform" by the University of Washington, published in January 2019, indicates that the hukou system is an internal migration control mechanism that continues to operate and centrally regulates the flow of labor. Each Chinese citizen must possess a document called hukou to have access to different public services (such as health, education or housing). There are two types of hukou: agricultural (nongye) and non-agricultural (fei nongye, considered as urban); in addition, a resident is classified according to the locality in which the authorities have registered him (hukou suozaidi). Thus, a job seeker who does not have the appropriate hukou is considered an illegal migrant and is subject to deportation, denial of services and social discrimination.

For its part, the January 2018 "Report to Congress On China's WTO Compliance: USTR" notes that despite positive developments, it is too early to say that Chinese citizens will enjoy freedom of mobility in their own country. Moreover, the social rights promised by the residence permit have not yet been realized. On the contrary, the current reform shows more central planning and top-down enforcement.

In the article "Labor Rights in China" by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, it is noted that, over the past decade, China has been an attractive destination for global corporations because of its low wages and labor laws that do not allow independent unions and limit the right to strike. Most workers in China's factories, mines, warehouses, docks and transportation hubs still have little or no say in the selection of their union representatives.

iii. That decisions by the sector or industry under investigation on prices, costs and input supplies, including raw materials, technology, production, sales and investment, be made in response to market signals and without significant state interference.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) Secretariat's Report of the Trade Policy Review of China, Document WT/TPR/S/342, dated October 12, 2016, states that the Chinese government applies price controls on goods and services considered of direct importance to the national economy and the livelihoods of the population. In addition, the state continues with direct intervention in banking, as the central government sets fees for basic commercial banking services, credit information services and bank letter transaction fees. This indicates that costs and prices of different inputs and services suffer from high government intervention, and it is difficult to establish them according to market signals.

The report also indicates that the number of SOEs in the industrial sector, which includes mining, manufacturing and electricity, gas and water production and supply, has increased year by year since 2011. Despite the fact that such companies represent 5% of industrial companies, government-owned companies continue to account for almost 40% of the sector's asset share, an unusually high share of government in industrial activity, indicating that inputs and costs are hardly set at market conditions.

The EC Paper mentions that the assets of foreign-owned entities centrally controlled by the Chinese government, both industrial and non-industrial, amount to some US$5.6 trillion in assets, with another US$690 billion overseas, while the total non-financial assets of state-owned entities at the central and sub-central levels exceed US$16 trillion. In terms of the industrial sector alone, according to the latest figures published by the IMF, state-owned enterprises (SOE's) are estimated to account for 40% of total industrial corporate assets and more than half of total corporate debt.

On the website http://en.sasac.gov.cn/[http://en.sasac.gov.cn/] of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC), it is mentioned that a significant percentage of SOEs operate under the ownership, control, supervision or policy guidance of the Chinese authorities, including several producers of steel, wire rod and wire, the main inputs for the commodity under review.

In the book "How State-owned Enterprise Drag on Economic Growth Theory and Evidence from China" by Ruiming Liu, 2019, it is indicated that, during the transition era, a large number of beneficiaries of small- and medium-scale SOE's were created in a special market environment of asymmetric competition, in which the upstream factor market was monopolized, while the downstream product market, was in competition. Also, the monopoly of the major government-owned enterprises in the factor market gave them the privilege of applying a stronger monopoly price, which amounted to an invisible tax, i.e., an invisible financial subsidy.

According to the European Commission Document, land is owned by the State (collectively owned rural land and State-owned urban land), therefore, land allocation depends solely on the State which can pursue specific policy objectives rather than free market principles.

In the document referred to in the previous point, it is stated that China is currently the largest energy producer in the world and about 50% of the power generation capacity and of the entire transmission network is state-owned. Also that 21 such companies controlled by SASAC, are active in the energy sector.

The European Commission document indicates that, as part of the reforms in the energy market, central pricing was phased out, however, prices are still not market-based, as they are still controlled by the State. One of the most important issues is the way in which prices are differentiated for different industries; differentiated prices exist for customers that consume large amounts of energy, or that is used in off-peak periods; as well as, differentiation between residential and industrial consumers. China has also subsidized coal production, which has triggered the construction of coal-fired power plants, creating an excess supply of electricity from this source. As a result, normal conditions do not prevail in the Chinese energy market, given government intervention in energy production and prices.

With respect to capital, the EC Paper notes that, although the liberalization of nominal interest rates that was achieved in October 2015, price signals are still not the result of free market forces, but are influenced by government-induced distortions. Artificially low interest rates result in underpricing and, consequently, overutilization of capital.

Raw materials and other inputs are affected, as the Chinese government has the ability to centrally fix the prices of certain goods. Although the list of centrally set prices has been greatly reduced, the government continues to intervene in cases where prices go against government policies. The example of the new rules regulating the price of coal shows that the gradual relaxation of prices can be reversed at any time. This, according to the European Commission document.

According to what was pointed out in the article "China Said to Intervene in Stocks After $590 Billion Sell Off", published by Bloomerg News, January 5, 2016, China intervenes in its stock markets, so that there is an artificial stability in the economy that does not allow prices and costs to be affected by market behaviors.

The European Commission's Paper noted that in the steel sector, state-owned enterprises play a central role. The Commission estimated that about half of the companies in the sector are directly state-owned (51% private and 49% state-owned when measuring production, and 44% state-owned and 56% private when measuring capacity); five Chinese steel producers (four of which are state-owned companies) are ranked among the top 10 largest steel producers in the world. It also notes that there is also a significant presence of state-owned enterprises in the mining industry, a supplier of raw materials for steel production; for example, large steel production companies such as Anshan Iron & Steel Corporation, Panzhihua Iron & Steel Corporation and Benxi Steel, are steel sector companies and also own iron ore mines.

In the same document, referred to above, it notes that state-owned companies play a leading role in the steel sector, so that private companies cannot operate under market conditions. As an example of the above, there is the case of Flat Coated Steel from China where the authority found that there is such a considerable predominance of state-owned companies that private producers have no alternative but to align their prices with those of state-owned companies, this is due to the severe competition that private companies face, in such a way that it has been completely smoothed out and have expressly stated that they intended to follow the policy set by the State.

According to the WTO Trade Policy Review, WT/TPR/S/375/Rev.1, September 14, 2018, not only does the structure of the sector manifest the decisive presence of the State, but the Chinese authorities recognize that their steel sector is characterized by a large installed overcapacity, and have made plans to reduce it. He added that the Review shows that the supply of inputs to the steel sector continues to be controlled by the State and that the Chinese government limits and controls the participation of foreign investors by dominating the entire market for oil, coal, electricity and conventional gas relevant to the reinforcing products industry.

In the European Commission Document, it is noted that in the anti-subsidy investigation of certain hot-rolled flat products of iron, non-alloy steel or other alloy steels from China, that according to the "Guidelines of the People's Bank of China, CBRC, CSRC CIRC", there are actionable subsidies specifically targeted at enterprises in the steel sector, and such guidelines oblige financial institutions to "fully recognize the pillar role and strategic importance of the steel and coal industries" and to "continue to provide credit support to steel enterprises that comply with the industrial policy, adjust and regroup without increasing their production capacity." In addition, there is significant support in the form of land use, tax burden reductions and fund transfers to the steel sector.

The European Commission indicated in the Countervailing Duty Implementing Regulation on certain hot-rolled flat products of iron, non-alloy steel or other alloy steel that the companies benefited by the Chinese government were Benxi Iron & Steel Group, Hesteel Group, Jiangsu Shagang Group and Shougang Group.

Deacero and Camesa pointed out that according to the World Steel Association (WSA), in its list of the main steel producers, it is reported that Benxi Iron & Steel occupies the 19th place among the main producers worldwide, and that, although the investigation carried out by the European Commission was for hot rolled steel sheet, said company also produces pre-strengthening products, according to the product catalog contained in its web page.

They also pointed out that the company Jiangsu Shagang Group is an important player (sixth steel producer in the world, according to the WSA list) of pre-stressed products, according to information on its website, so the subsidy found in the case of hot rolled sheet also reaches the production of pre-stressed products.

Likewise, they mentioned that the Shougang Group, China has an important participation in the production of long steel, among which is the reinforcing steel product. According to its website, through its subsidiary Changzhi Steel & Iron Company, it is engaged in the production of pre-strengthening products for the manufacture of bridges.

Deacero and Camesa argued that, regardless of the fact that these are actionable subsidies, all this means that the prices of inputs, as well as the costs and supply of the sector and industry under examination, are not adopted in response to market signals, but are set through significant State interference.

In the investigation published by the Federal Register on certain alloy or carbon steel pipe products, it was indicated that Hunan Valin Xiangtan Iron & Steel Co. Ltd., obtained a subsidy from the Chinese government, also the national production indicated that according to its web page, this company not only produces pipe, but also dedicates a good part of its production to the production of pre-stressing products, therefore concluding that the subsidy that the investigating authority of the United States found for the production of pipe, also applies to the pre-stressing products, given that the subsidy is for the company and not for the product that was subject to investigation.

Deacero and Camesa mentioned that in 2020 the International Trade Administration published the Final document "Results of Expedited Sunset Review of Countervailing Duty Order: Prestressed Concrete Steel Wire Strand From the People's Republic of China", where it was determined that certain producers of prestressing products continue to receive subsidies from the Chinese government, among which are private and state-owned companies. In this regard, Deacero and Camesa argued that regardless of whether the company is state-owned or not, the industrial policy exercised by the Chinese government is taken advantage of by companies outside the state sphere.

Deacero and Camesa pointed out that the China Baowu Steel Group Corporation Limited (China Baowu Steel Group) is under the SASAC and was formed through the merger and restructuring of the companies Baosteel Group Corporation Limited and Wuhan Iron & Steel Group Corporation; being that the subsidiary companies that formed the Baosteel Group in the iron and steel department were: Baoshan Iron & Steel Co, (Baoshan Iron & Steel); Xinjiang Bayi Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. (Xinjiang Bayi Iron & Steel); Ningbo Iron & Steel Co., Ltd.; Shaoguan Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. (Shaoguan Iron & Steel); Baosteel Stainless Steel Co., Ltd., and Baosteel Special Material Co., Ltd. In particular, it is noted that Baoshan Iron & Steel produces pre-strengthening products.

Likewise, the companies of the Ansteel group belong to the central government with participation of the local government of Hebei province, and are under the SASAC and according to the list of producing companies of the World Steel Association, the company ranks twelfth among steel producers in the world, in addition to being a producer of pre-strengthening products.

Deacero and Camesa indicated that, in addition to the effects of artificially low input prices due to government intervention, the supply of raw material must be considered, particularly wire rod, which can be considered the initial and main component of pre-stressing products. These distortions can be deduced from the estimate of the reconstructed value of wire rod. To support this argument, they presented the prices of wire rod from China, Germany and the United States for 2020, obtained from the CRU Group (CRU), where they observed that the prices in China are below the international prices of those countries. This means that the prices of the inputs used to manufacture pre-strengthening products deviate significantly from international prices.

In addition, the existence of subsidies and forms of public fund transfers to both the Chinese steel sector and the reinforcing products industry result in prices, costs and supplies of inputs not being adopted in response to market signals, but rather are governed by significant state intervention.

That foreign investment and co-investment with foreign firms be allowed.

In the Report of the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on barriers to trade and investment, it is mentioned that information could be found with respect to restrictions on foreign investment in the steel sector, so that they can conclude that government intervention with respect to investments in the sector is sufficient to determine that these are not in accordance with market principles. They confirm this situation in the 2018 report where they state that China introduced four new barriers in 2018, which confirms the trend observed in the previous year, when a maximum of ten barriers were reported. This development has resulted in China consolidating its position as the most restrictive trading partner for the European Union.

The U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC) in its report "China's Status as a Non-Market Economy" Memorandum A-570-053, dated October 26, 2017, states that foreign direct investments require approval from the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China (MOFCOM) to ensure, among other things, that there is no injury to "China's sovereignty", "public interest" or the"state security" and that the "requirements for the development of China's national economy" are met, in accordance with State Council guidelines. In contrast, local companies need only register with government authorities, without the need for MOFCOM approval.

The WTO Trade Policy Review, WT/TPR/S/375/Rev.1, confirms the continued operation of the Investment Catalogue as "the main instrument used to guide foreign direct investment in China". The latest version of this instrument, issued in 2017, makes classifications of investments "in the recommended category" on the one hand, and on the other hand, indicates a "Negative List", which contains a list of industries where foreign direct investment is restricted or prohibited. In addition, it indicates that the import and export of oil is in the hands of the State; foreign investment in oil exploration and development is encouraged, but participation is limited to Sino-foreign equity and cooperative joint ventures or other forms of cooperation, including Production Sharing Contracts known as (PSCs), a legal instrument that allows China to retain exploration rights and where foreign parties can only manage exploration, development and production as partners.

The foreign investment management policy also affects the steel sector via its impact on the companies that supply raw materials, inputs and services. In the latest WTO report, it is indicated that the import and export of oil is in the hands of the State; foreign investment in oil exploration and development is encouraged, but participation is limited to joint ventures of Chinese-foreign capital and cooperation or other forms of cooperation, including PSCs, a legal instrument that allows China to retain exploration rights and where foreign parties can only manage exploration, development and production as partners. Thus, foreign capital can only participate in the upstream production chain through the aforementioned PSC contracts; in this scheme, only China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), China Petrochemical Corporation (SINOPEC) and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) are authorized to cooperate with foreign investors in onshore and offshore oil exploitation.

Gas is one of the basic inputs for the steel sector and is in state hands according to the WTO report, natural gas distribution is mainly controlled by the aforementioned state-owned companies CNPC and SINOPEC, while private companies play a more important role only in gas retail sectors.

Electricity is another basic input in the sector, also controlled by the State. The foreign investment regime in the electricity sector is regulated by the 2017 Investment Catalogue, which stipulates that the construction and operation of networks (which includes electricity transmission and distribution) falls under the restricted category, and must be controlled by the Chinese government. Foreign investors may participate in the construction and operation of grids through partnerships with Chinese companies, but they must be controlled by the Chinese government.

The mining sector is another area with difficulties for foreign investment. The WTO indicates in its latest report that said sector, is included in "the prohibited category in the Investment Catalogue" and "remained unchanged between 2015 and 2017."

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in its report "FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index 2019", indicates that China is the most restrictive country in terms of steel investment, and that OECD countries, in this sector, have an index close to zero; that is, it is one of the sectors with the least restrictions to foreign investment in the world market, with an average index of 0.017, while China has an average of 0.075, and with sectors that provide services and inputs with indicators with much lower accessibility when compared to the rest of the countries or even closed (such as electricity distribution, banking and legal services, communication, among others).

According to the report "Inquiry Into the Status of the People's Republic of China as a Nonmarket" prepared by the AISI, the restriction to investment in the steel sector in China can occur indirectly, through policies that establish that in this sector solid mechanisms should be created to share technology, resources and sales channels, among others, a situation that is contradictory to the principles that govern a market economy.

That the industry under investigation has only one set of accounting records that are used for all purposes and are audited in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Although, in China there could be an accounting established in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the legal framework in that country allows the existence of more than one set of accounting books, one for publication and the other for the company. This, according to the publication "Bio Technology, An Indian Journal: Analysis of cause of Financial fraud and precautions" by Yiji Chen, Trade Science Inc.

They indicated that, even if companies in China had a single accounting book and used in theory generally accepted accounting principles, the legal system and the large participation of government enterprises in the economy generate that in reality the financial and accounting information is not reliable, even in the steel sector.

In the article "Accounting & Bookkeeping in China" by Lehman Brown, 2016, it is stated that China does not have recognized international standards such as IFRS27 (International Financing Reporting Standards) and US GAAP28 (US Generally Accepted Standards); although in recent reforms they have brought their accounting system closer; emphasizes that many of the accounting standards in China may seem uncommon to foreign-invested enterprises with cross-border interests operating in China, so, "it is important to understand and navigate these differences in the way information is reported, understanding the impact within the ratios and their compliance with China Accounting Standards (CAS )."

In the WTO Trade Policy Review, WT/TPR/S/375/Rev.1, it is noted that the practice of accounting services in China is permitted only in the form of partnerships or limited liability companies, established and managed by Certified Public Accountants licensed by the Chinese authorities. Foreigners may take China's national accounting examination and foreign accounting firms may affiliate with Chinese firms and enter into contractual agreements.

According to Dezan Shira & Associates' book, "Managing your Accounting and Bookkeeping in China" the standards that are called Generally Accepted Accounting Practices in China (PRC GAAP) are applied since 2014 to SOE's, banks and other large companies, but there are multiple differences with the international standards, for example, in the way accounting reporting of companies belonging to the same entity, reporting of employee pay and benefits, valuation of assets, among other aspects. In other words, in any of its modalities, local accounting standards differ from international standards and, in any case, are centrally regulated by the government.

That the production costs and financial situation of the sector or industry under investigation are not distorted in relation to depreciation of assets, bad debts, barter trade and debt compensation payments or other factors deemed relevant.

The WTO Trade Policy Review, WT/TPR/S/375/Rev.1, confirms that major monetary policy decisions on prices and deposit rates require approval by the Council of State. Rates on money market instruments such as repurchase and debt instruments are set directly by the Central Bank of China.

Also, in this review, the WTO indicates that financial burdens are lightened in accordance with the central development plans of strategic areas defined by the State, through tax breaks or tax forgiveness, despite the fact that the authorities indicate that several of these tax regimes have been eliminated. The WTO indicates that tax preferences continue to be granted to high-tech companies established in a special economic zone (Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen or Hainan) or in the Pudong New Area in Shanghai.

The EC Paper notes that the Chinese banking sector continues to be characterized by the existence of predominant categories of state-owned and controlled banks (large commercial banks, commercial joint-stock banks and state policy banks). Government-owned banks under one of these categories account for almost 70% of total banking assets in China. The remainder is mainly smaller commercial, rural or urban banks, mostly owned by local or provincial governments, and foreign-invested banks remain insignificant in the banking sector, and available information suggests that Chinese banks are the largest holders of corporate bonds issued by the state sector.

Large commercial banks were introduced in China around the 1980s as a government initiative, during which time four state-owned commercial banks were created so that the Central Bank of China could concentrate on the usual tasks of central banking, instead of functioning as a proper commercial entity. Thus, in 1979, the Agricultural Bank of China was created to handle government financing of grain procurement and rural development. In the same year, the Bank of China took over the foreign currency portfolio. In 1984, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China began financing China's state-owned enterprises. At the same time, the China Construction Bank, which had been part of MOFCOM, gained operational independence to lend to long-term state-owned investment projects. Thus the so-called "Big Four" state-owned banks were born. Also, together with the Bank of Communications, the five large commercial banks account for almost 40% of the total Chinese financial market, with the Chinese government being the controlling shareholder in each of these banks. In the rest of the commercial joint-stock banking sector, the State also exercises control, and together with these five banks, they account for more than two-thirds of the commercial lending banking operations. It is worth noting that the analysis of the individual profiles of the members of the Board of Directors of these banks reveals that most of the positions have been assigned to professionals who are connected to the government apparatus, with personnel who worked for government institutions with membership in the Communist Party of China.

According to the document "Analysis of cause of financial fraud and precautions" by Yiji Chen, the financial situation of the Chinese steel industry is distorted, as the Chinese government grants different types of incentives and subsidies to it, including preferential credits, credit guarantees, tax refunds and direct subsidies, among others.

The state government in Beijing continues to help steel and wire rod producer Bohai Steel, as it will have a debt restructuring sponsored by the Tianjin government, which will guarantee the payment of its liabilities, as reported in the article "Tianjin government helps restructure Bohai Steel's debt" by South China Morning Post, August 29, 2019.

China's government granted money to wire rod producer Chongqing Iron and Steel (Chongqing) and steelmaker Valin Steel Co, Ltd (Valin) to solve their financial problems and prevent them from being delisted from the stock market, as noted in the Reuters China Subsidies Report "Steel industry on subsidy life-support as China economy slows." The Liaoning provincial government intervened to help the Dongbei steel company resolve its debt default, pressuring its creditors to accept as payment only one third of the original debt. This is according to the Wall Street Journal's report on Chinese steel company debt defaults.

The Chinese steel industry suffers from distortion in its production costs and production decisions due to government intervention in the raw materials and energy input sector, and the fact that the government owns companies that are producers of inputs in the steel production chain and the reinforcing products industry.

The Secretariat analyzed the information provided by Deacero and Camesa and requested Deacero and Camesa to present the arguments and evidence that in the production and sale of the product under review, manufactured by companies of the industry of reinforcing products in China, prevailed cost and price structures that were not determined according to market principles, and to indicate the participation of each of the factors of production (land, labor, capital and energy) that are intensively used in the manufacture of the product under review, the evidentiary elements that would allow identifying the distortion in the use of the factors of production of the reinforcing products due to the government intervention in China and how this situation gives the character of non-market economy to the industry of reinforcing products and that would explain the distortions in each stage of the value chain of reinforcing products until reaching the final price in the internal market of China, as indicated in points 21 to 24 of this Resolution.

In response to the information requirement, Deacero and Camesa reiterated that according to the Annual Report on Exchange Rates and Exchange Rate Restrictions published by the IMF, China has adopted an exchange rate policy consisting of exchange controls through a fluctuation band set by the government and that within the categories on which it detected that they still maintain some type of restriction are, among others, payment controls for invisible transactions and current transfers, commercial credits, direct investment settlement controls and personal capital transaction controls.

Deacero and Camesa noted that some of the major manufacturers of pre-stressed products have directly or indirectly received subsidies for inputs used in the production of the product under review, such as Wuhan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd, (Baosteel Group Nantong), Xinjiang Bayi Iron & Steel, Shaoguan Iron & Steel, Echeng Iron & Steel, Baosteel Special Steel, Baosteel Stainless Steel, Baosteel Metals, Hesteel Group, Jiangsu Shagang Group, Benxi Iron & Steel Group, Shougang Group and Hunan Valin Iron & Steel Group Co., Ltd.

They reiterated that there are companies producing wire rod and pre-strengthening products that are subsidiaries of China Baowu Steel Group, which is administered by the Chinese government and SASAC. According to the Baowu Group's website, the subsidiaries producing these products are:

Wuhan Iron and Steel, according to its website, that company's high-speed wire rod production line was completed and put into operation in 1996, with an annual output designed to produce 800,000 tons;

Baosteel Group Nantong, engaged in wire processing by wire rod stretching or drawing, is committed to the production of high grade and high quality prestressing products, as well as steel wires and oil-quenched spring steel wire products. The annual production scale is 180,000 tons, of which one third is exported;

Xinjiang Bayi Iron & Steel, has an annual output of 570,000 tons of steel and has been producing wire ropes and pre-strengthening products since 1999;

Shaoguan Iron & Steel, is a major iron and steel producer in Guangdong province, being an integrated enterprise in manufacturing, logistics and trading of prestressing products, with an annual output of 6.5 million tons;

Baosteel Metal Co., Ltd. is engaged in steel processing, mainly producing various kinds of steel wires, including PC steel cable for cable-stayed bridges; and

according to the Baowu Group's product catalog, shows the wide variety of wire products produced from wire rod, including pre-strengthening products.

Input subsidies allow these companies to obtain their raw materials at subsidized prices, thus making it possible for them to offer their product at a lower price. In other words, prices are not formed according to market signals and such subsidies distort the prices and costs of the product under review.

The United States International Trade Commission (USTIC) in the sunset review on "Carb and Cert Alloy Steel Wire Rod", 2020, confirmed the existence of subsidies among which are: (i) provision of steel inputs at subsidized prices; (ii) provision of electricity; (iii) provision of subsidies through the State Key Technology Projects Fund; (iv) tax and duty waivers, preferential tax rates and Value Added Tax exemptions for imported equipment; and (v) subsidies granted for location in special zones.

According to Deacero's production costs, more than 80% of the manufacturing costs correspond to the cost of raw materials (wire rod, energy and labor) and mechanical maintenance, thus demonstrating that the main inputs used for the manufacture of pre-strengthening products are distorted. This distortion is transmitted directly to the products under examination.

Regardless of whether the companies producing wire rod and pre-stressing products are state-owned, the subsidies granted by the State distort the prices of the inputs that are not formed according to market signals and are not in line with market signals.such subsidies distort the prices and costs of the product under examination.

Deacero and Camesa concluded that, according to the most recent international studies, it is confirmed that the Chinese government has direct control through regulation or direct ownership of the main companies in the steel sector, both state-owned and "private capital"; to which it grants recourse subsidies and locates its companies in favored zones, while favoring them with tax incentives for exports and with the supply of raw material and inputs at preferential prices.

Determination

For the purpose of validating the arguments that in China the conditions of a non-market economy persist with respect to the industry of pre-stressed products, the Secretariat carried out a comprehensive analysis of the arguments and information provided by Deacero and Camesa in this review and that are in the administrative record. At the outset, the Secretariat notes that, in accordance with paragraph 15(d) of the Protocol of Accession of China to the WTO, only subparagraph (a) romanita (ii) expired in December 2016. However, as current text, subparagraph (a) and romanita (i) of paragraph 15 of the Protocol of Accession of China to the WTO remain in force. In the aforementioned subparagraph a), it establishes the possibility of applying a methodology based on prices or costs in China, of Chinese producers, or a methodology that is not based on those prices or costs. Thus, the Secretariat considers that the mere expiration of paragraph 15(a)(ii) of the Protocol of Accession of China to the WTO does not mean that the possibility of using a methodology that is not based on a strict comparison with domestic prices or costs in China has ceased to exist.

Indeed, the methodological bases for determining price comparability in antidumping proceedings involving products of Chinese origin are expressly contained, in principle, in paragraph 15(a) of the Protocol of Accession of China to the WTO, which, like romanita (i), has not expired. In accordance with subparagraph a), there is a legal possibility to use the prices or costs of the producers in China, or to use a methodology that is not based on a strict comparison with the prices or costs in that country.

In this sense, it is important to highlight that, in this review proceeding, no Chinese producers-exporters appeared. Consequently, the support that in China and, specifically, in the industry producing pre-stressed products, there are cost and price structures that are not determined according to market principles, is attentive to the analysis of the arguments and evidence provided by Deacero and Camesa.

The Secretariat considers that there is a legal basis to evaluate the proposal of Deacero and Camesa to consider China as a non-market economy in the manufacture, production and sale of pre-stressed products, in accordance with Articles 33 of the LCE and 48 of the RLCE and, consequently, to analyze the appropriateness of applying the substitute country methodology, mainly due to the following considerations:

Regarding the exchange rate, the Chinese currency is not freely convertible, since it reflects exchange controls and capital flow barriers granted by the Chinese government. In addition, the Annual Report on Exchange Rates and Exchange Rate Restrictions published by the IMF indicates that China continues to maintain restrictions in most of the 12 categories indicated in point 119 of this Resolution;

In addition, the AISI reinforces the existence of Chinese government intervention in its foreign exchange markets given that the convertibility of its currency is limited for certain purposes, such as financial transactions;

in relation to labor, workers' rights and their power to negotiate wages are extremely limited due to the AFL-CIO, and China has not ratified the ILO conventions on forced labor, freedom of association and protection of the right to organize, the right to organize and collective bargaining, the abolition of forced labor, and labor inspection, among others;

the labor force is affected by the restrictions on mobility in China, since there is an internal migration control called hukou, which also restricts access to public services, according to the article "China's Hukou System at 60: Continuity and Reform", described in paragraph 129 of this Resolution;

the majority of workers in China's factories, mines, warehouses, docks and transportation centers do not have complete freedom to select their union representatives, as described in paragraph 131 of this Resolution;

regarding the fact that the decisions of the sector or industry under examination are made in response to market signals and without significant interference from the State, the following is observed:

according to the information provided by Deacero, inputs such as wire rod, materials, energy and labor operate under the ownership, control and supervision of the State. These inputs account for more than 50% of the main production costs in the manufacture of pre-strengthening products;

According to the Trade Policy Review of China, Document WT/TPR/S/342, about 40% of industrial enterprises are state-owned, including mining, manufacturing, electricity, gas and water production and supply enterprises;

iii. according to the European Commission Document, there are large state-owned steel production companies such as Anshan Iron & Steel, Panzhihua Iron & Steel and Benxi Steel, which play a leading role in the sector, such that private companies are unable to operate under market conditions;

the state continues to influence the markets, and this effect is reflected in artificially low interest rates;

the steel industry continues to benefit from incentives and support, such as preferential credits, credit guarantees and tax refunds. Specifically, there are wire rod producing companies whose financial situation was benefited by the Chinese government through the granting of credits, under the promise of paying the interest owed by the company; debt restructuring, guaranteeing the payment of liabilities, granting money to the company, pressuring creditors to reduce the company's debt and debt forgiveness. These companies are Bohai Steel, Chongqing, Valin and Dongbei. According to the documents of the European Commission and Analysis of cause of financial fraud and precautions by Yiji Chen;

the European Commission determined that the companies Benxi Iron & Steel Group, Hesteel Group, Jiangsu Shagang Group, China Shougang Group, were benefited with subsidies from the Chinese government, in the investigation of hot rolled flat products of iron, non-alloy steel or other alloy steels, and that according to what is described in points 147 to 150 of this Resolution, said companies are also producers of pre-strengthening products;

vii. the International Trade Administration in 2020, determined that the Chinese government continues to subsidize pre-stressing products, both to private and state-owned companies;

viii. the China Baowu Steel Group, which is under SASAC, has subsidiary companies producing reinforcing products and basic inputs for their manufacture, such as Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baosteel Group Nantong, Xinjiang Bayi Iron & Steel, Shaoguan Iron & Steel, Baosteel Metal, Baoshan Iron & Steel;

Ansteel Group companies also belong to the central government with the participation of the local government of Hebei province, which are under the SASAC, and are producers of reinforcement products;

The USTIC in the sunset review of steel and alloy wire rod found that subsidies on wire rod, the raw material for reinforcing products, continue. Although this element alone is not definitive for a positive determination in this proceeding, there are sufficient elements to infer that the governmental support policies on this raw material continue;

the Secretariat identified distortions in other raw materials and inputs that affect the allocation of resources in the production of pre-stressed products, such as: (i) land, which is state-owned and its allocation depends solely on the State; ii) energy, in which the State controls through SASAC 50% of the generation capacity and the transmission network, in addition to the fact that there are no market conditions in prices, despite the fact that central price fixing has been gradually withdrawn, and iii) raw materials, in which the State has the ability to centrally fix prices that go against government policies, as in the case of coal, which has triggered the construction of coal-fired plants, until creating an excess supply of electricity from this source, and

xii. the Secretariat observed that there are public policies, as well as companies that produce basic inputs and the merchandise under examination, which are state-owned or that, although they have received support from the Chinese government in different products, this support can be transferred to the cost and price structure of the reinforcement products, since they are not specific for a product but for a sector, in which the merchandise under examination is found.

According to the WTO Trade Policy Review, WT/TPR/S/375/Rev.1 and the USDOC report "China's as a non Market Economy", foreign investment in China requires MOFCOM approval to ensure that State Council guidelines are met and that foreign capital can only participate in the forward production chain through Production Sharing Contracts;

in the FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index 2019 report, the OECD indicates that China is the most restrictive country for steel investment;

China does not have an accounting system under generally accepted accounting principles, nor recognized international standards such as IFRS27 and US GAAP28, according to the publication Accounting & Bookkeeping in China;

the financial situation of the Chinese steel industry is distorted, since the government grants different types of incentives and subsidies, including preferential credits, credit guarantees, tax refunds and direct subsidies. This, according to Yiji Chen's Analysis of cause of financial fraud and precautions;

financial burdens are alleviated in accordance with the central development plans of strategic zones defined by the State, through tax breaks or tax forgiveness; thus, although the authorities point out that several of these tax regimes have been eliminated, the WTO in the "Trade Policy Review", WT/TPR/S/375/Rev.1 indicates that tax preferences are still granted to high-tech companies, and

the Beijing government continues to help steel and wire rod producer Bohai Steel, as it will have a debt restructuring sponsored by the Tianjin government, which will guarantee the payment of its liabilities, as reported in the article "Tianjin Government helps restructure Bohai Steel's debt" in the South China Morning Post.

Based on the above, the Secretariat considers that the information provided by the national production generates the presumption that, the companies that produce reinforcing products in China, prevail cost and price structures that are not determined according to market principles, because, from the updated and available information that exists in the administrative record, distortions were identified in the market of the factors that affect the allocation of resources in the production of the product under review and interfere with the determination of the costs and prices of the productive factors in which it is intensive.

In view of the above and in accordance with paragraph 15 paragraph a) of the Protocol of Accession of China to the WTO, articles 33 of the LCE and 48 of the RLCE, the Secretariat proceeded to analyze the proposal to use a substitute country for China for the purpose of calculating the normal value.

Camesa in its arguments of the second evidentiary period presented an estimate of normal value with the domestic prices in China of the product under examination.

In this regard, as stated in paragraphs 189 to 194 of this Resolution, the Secretariat analyzed the information provided by the national production regarding domestic prices in China and considered for this procedure not to take into account such prices as a basis for the calculation of the normal value, since it was proved the presumption that in the companies that produce reinforcing products in China prevail cost and price structures that are not determined according to market principles.

Selection of substitute country

Deacero and Camesa proposed Brazil as a surrogate market economy country for China to determine the normal value. To demonstrate that in such country market conditions exist in the industry of pre-stressing products, they indicated that the price of such product is determined by the free participation of suppliers and demanders, there are no restrictions to the entry or exit of this type of product, there is no governmental interference in the decisions of such sector since the State does not participate in any producing company nor has policies that impose price controls or quotas to the production, commercialization, importation or exportation of such product. They added that the criteria with which it is possible to know when there is a market economy are contained in the second paragraph of article 48 of the RLCE, and presented the following arguments and evidence to justify the selection of the substitute country:

they indicated that according to the report of the company OANDA, Brazil is a market economy country, where there is a free conversion of currency in the exchange market since 1999. In the report "Brazil Investment Climate Statement 2020", prepared by the U.S. Department of State, it is indicated that there is a free conversion of the Brazilian currency in the exchange market, in which the buying or selling rates are determined by market forces;

The report also states that there is free conversion of the Brazilian currency in the foreign exchange market, in which the buying or selling rates are determined by market forces;

mentioned that according to the report prepared by Deloitte, regarding labor relations in Brazil, it can be concluded that there is freedom in labor relations, since workers have the right to join unions, to collective bargaining and to enjoy fundamental labor rights; a situation that is corroborated in the report "Brazil Investment Climate Statement 2020";

in relation to State interference in the sector's decisions on prices, costs and supply of inputs, they argued that according to a publication on the S&P Global website, fluctuations in the prices of raw materials in Brazil and steel products respond to economic circumstances or phenomena linked to movements in their respective markets; regarding foreign investments and co-investments with foreign firms, they also pointed out that the "Brazil Investment Climate Statement 2020" report indicates that Brazil is an open country that encourages foreign direct investment, in which there is no distinction between foreign and domestic investment;

according to the report "Doing Business with Brazil", prepared by the consulting firm Price WaterHouse Cooper, it is described that Brazilian companies must report their accounting information through a system that integrates commercial and tax records in a single set of books, and

to prove that the production costs and financial situation of the sector in Brazil do not suffer distortions, they mentioned that, in the Brazilian financial system, there are several financial institutions, such as the Central Bank and private banks, which allows to presume that it has a modern financial system that works under market principles, according to the report "Brazil Investment Climate Statement 2020".

In order to prove that in Brazil the same or similar pre-strengthening products to those produced in China are produced, Deacero and Camesa provided the production process of a Chinese and a Brazilian company. The Secretariat consulted the Internet pages provided and corroborated that the companies are producers of the merchandise examined.

To demonstrate the similarity in the production process they pointed out that, the cost structures of the factors that are intensively used in the production process are similar, therefore: (i) the productive process in both countries is developed through the same productive phases; (ii) in both countries it is developed mainly through the use of machinery, that is, it is a capital intensive industry; (iii) it is not labor intensive; (iv) the machinery used in the productive process in both countries is of a mature and similar technology; (v) the same inputs are used in the productive process in both countries, among them, steel wire rod and energy; and (vi) the raw material constitutes the main cost element.

Regarding the availability of inputs, they indicated that Brazil and China are producers of steel wire rod, which is the basic input for the manufacture of the reinforcing products. They added that energy is also another important input in the production process and that both countries have this resource available to supply their respective local demands. For each of the countries they presented statistical information obtained from the report "Steel-long-products-monitor-2021-april-prodcons", through the CRU website and, regarding energy production and consumption, they obtained it from the Statistical Yearbook of the Enerdata Global Energy consultant's website.

They argued that the price of the Brazilian product similar to the one under review is not found in the Brazilian market.distorted by governmental policies or unfair trade practices, and that there are no subsidy or price discrimination claims against the Brazilian industry of the prestressing product. The above, according to the information presented in the market study "Brazilian Market for Prestressing Wire and PC Strand" ("Estudio de Mercado") prepared by a consultant specialized in the steel industry, which the Secretariat corroborated.

In addition, they submitted a letter issued by the Executive President of the ACO Brazil Institute where he states that the producers of long rolled products are controlled by private groups. Deacero and Camesa indicated that the main input of the pre-strengthening products, which is wire rod, is found in these products. To prove the above, they submitted the 2021 yearbook of the Institute, where it is stated that wire rod is categorized within the long rolled products.

Determination

The third paragraph of article 48 of the RLCE states that a substitute country shall be understood as a third country with a market economy similar to the exporting country with a centrally planned economy. The similarity between the substitute country and the exporting country shall be defined in a reasonable manner, in such a way that the normal value in the exporting country can be approximated based on the domestic price in the substitute country, considering economic criteria.

In order to comply with this provision, the Secretariat carried out an analysis of the information provided by the national production described in paragraphs 197 to 202 of this Resolution. It observed that both countries manufacture pre-stressed products and use a similar productive process, which is capital intensive and have availability of the main inputs for the manufacture of pre-stressed products, such as wire rod and energy. Thus, it can be reasonably inferred that the intensity in the use of factors of production is similar in both countries.

Based on the analysis described in the previous points of this Resolution, and in accordance with articles 33 of the LCE and 48 of the RLCE, the Secretariat confirmed the selection of Brazil as a substitute market economy country for China for the purpose of calculating the normal value.

Brazilian domestic prices

In order to prove the normal value, Deacero and Camesa submitted the market study referred to in paragraph 201 of this Resolution, which includes price quotations of reinforcing wire and reinforcing strand from BBA-ArcelorMittal. They pointed out that the prices are above cost and give rise to a profit margin, so they should be considered normal commercial operations.

They clarified that the company BBA-ArcelorMittal arises from the merger of the companies ArcelorMittal and Belgo Bekaert Arames (BBA). As documentary support, they submitted the company profile of BBA-ArcelorMittal, in addition, to prove that it is a producer of pre-strengthening products, they submitted the product catalog of BBA-ArcelorMittal, and in the mentioned Market Study, the production data of pre-strengthening products of BBA is observed. On the other hand, the Secretariat accessed the Internet page of said company and corroborated the information submitted by the national production.

They mentioned that the prices are net of discounts, reimbursements and bonuses, since at the time of requesting the price quotation by the consultant who conducted the market study, he acted as a retailer, in addition to the fact that the price references specify a discount at the time of payment of 5% for cash payment.

The Secretariat requested Deacero and Camesa to provide the documentary support of the prices of wire rod and the methodology used to calculate the costs with which it was determined that the prices are above costs. In this regard, Deacero and Camesa presented the acquisition price of wire rod from ArcelorMittal with which they estimated the production cost for pre-strengthening products.

The cost of labor was obtained from the minimum wage in force in Brazil indicated on the website https://www.contabeis.com.br/tabelas/salario-minimo[https://www.contabeis.com.br/tabelas/salario-minimo]. According to Deacero's cost structure, they considered for other production costs the fixed costs of depreciation and maintenance; as variable costs, they considered spare parts, energy, materials used in packaging, among others. They compared these costs with the price at which the product under examination is sold in the Brazilian domestic market, noting that there is a profit margin.

The price references are outside the period of examination, therefore, to bring them to the period examined, Deacero and Camesa adjusted them according to the producer price index in Brazil obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). The Secretariat accessed the IBGE's website and corroborated the information related to the producer price index.

Likewise, they adjusted said prices for tax charges, in particular, for the ICMS tax; to prove the amount of said tax, they submitted a report from the consulting firm Deloitte, where the applicable rate for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and for internal freight is observed.

Determination

Based on the information provided by the national production, the Secretariat calculated the normal value for the reinforcing wire and reinforcing strand in dollars per ton, in the domestic market of Brazil, in accordance with articles 2.1 of the Antidumping Agreement, 31 of the LCE, 39 and 58 of the RLCE.

Adjustments to the normal value

Domestic freight

Deacero and Camesa, in order to prove the adjustment for internal freight in Brazil, submitted a price quotation of the company Trelog for transporting 25 tons of merchandise under examination, from the production plants of BBA-ArcelorMittal to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, outside the period under examination.

The Secretariat accessed the web page https://www.trelogs.com/[https://www.trelogs.com/] of said transportation company and corroborated that it is a multi-award winning international freight transportation company, with several years of extensive experience in global shipments and freight forwarding.

To estimate the adjustment for domestic freight in Brazil, Deacero and Camesa made a weighted average of the cost of transporting the merchandise examined based on the production capacity of the three plants that produce BBA-ArcelorMittal's pre-stressing products, and then divided the amount by 25 tons, thus obtaining an adjustment amount in dollars per ton. Subsequently, to carry the adjustment to the period of examination, they applied the producer price index in Brazil obtained from the IBGE.

In this regard, the Secretariat determined to adjust the price references for internal freight, however, it considered to make a simple average of the information on internal freight provided by the national production, since the productive capacity is not a variable that affects the movement of merchandise, however, it was considered to apply the producer price index, since the quotation is outside the period under examination.

Determination of the analysis on the continuation or recurrence of dumping

In accordance with the information and methodology described in the previous points, and based on articles 6.8, 11.3, 11.4 and Annex II of the Antidumping Agreement, 54 second paragraph, 64 last paragraph, 70 section II and 89 F of the LCE, the Secretariat analyzed the information of the export price and the normal value, and determined that there are sufficient elements to support that, if the antidumping duties were eliminated, the dumping practice would continue or repeat in the exports to Mexico of pre-strengthening products, originating in China, Spain and Portugal.

Analysis on the continuation or recurrence of injury

The Secretariat analyzed the information that the national production provided in the procedure and that is in the administrative record, as well as the information that it itself provided, in order to determine if there are elements to support that the elimination of the antidumping duties imposed on imports of pre-stressed products originating from China, Spain and Portugal, would lead to the continuation or repetition of the injury to the national industry of the like product.

The analysis of the economic and financial indicators includes the information provided by Deacero and Camesa, since both companies constitute the domestic industry of the like product, as determined in paragraph 226 of this Resolution. To carry out this analysis, the Secretariat considered the information for the period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020, which includes both the analyzed period and the period under examination, as well as the information related to the estimates for the periods from January 1 to December 31, 2021 and from January 1 to December 31, 2022. Unless otherwise indicated, the behavior of the economic and financial indicators of a given year or period is analyzed with respect to the immediately preceding comparable period.

Domestic production branch

Deacero and Camesa submitted a letter from ANTAAC describing the participation of these companies in the domestic production of pre-strengthening products during the period from 2016 to 2020. According to ANTAAC, Deacero and Camesa accounted for 100% of the national production from 2016 to 2019 and 90% in the examination period.

In their joint response to the first evidentiary period injunction, they submitted an email from ANTAAC where they updated the participation of Deacero and Camesa in the domestic production of the examination period to 89.8%.

Deacero and Camesa assured that Republic Steel Wire Mexico is another domestic manufacturer of pre-strengthening products, which started operations in 2020. Therefore, the Secretariat requested this company to provide the volume of its production as well as its sales to the internal and external market for the analyzed period. In this regard, Republic Steel Wire did not respond to the requirement.

Consequently, the Secretariat calculated the total domestic production of the products of reinforcing steel similar to the ones under examination based on the information that ANTAAC, Deacero and Camesa provided regarding the participation of the producing companies in the domestic production, as well as their production volumes of this product, for the analyzed period.

Additionally, Deacero and Camesa indicated that during the analyzed period they did not import the merchandise under examination. In this regard, the Secretariat analyzed the list of import operations of the SIC-M and observed that, in effect, Deacero and Camesa did not import any pre-strengthening products from China, Spain or Portugal during the analyzed period.

Based on the analysis of the information in the administrative record, the Secretariat determined that Deacero and Camesa constitute the domestic industry, representing 89.8% of the domestic production of pre-stressed products, in the period under review, in accordance with the provisions of articles 4.1 and 5.4 of the Antidumping Agreement, 40 and 50 of the LCE and 60 and 61 of the RLCE.

International Market

Deacero and Camesa indicated that they did not have at their disposal specific information of the industry of pre-strengthening products at an international level, therefore they provided statistics of production and apparent consumption of the steel wire rod industry, primary input of the product under review, obtained from CRU.

Based on the information described in the previous point, they stated that China has been the main and largest producer of this raw material worldwide, since its production volume in 2020 represented more than 70% of the world production and was more than 65 times greater than the production volume of Mexico, which is located in the ninth place of the main producing countries of this input. In addition, China is among the world's top ten consumers of this raw material.

Likewise, based on statistics of subheadings 7217.10 and 7312.10 of Trade Map, they indicated that, in the period examined, China, Portugal and Spain are among the main cable exporting countries, occupying the second, eighth and twentieth place, respectively, which makes evident their great productive and exporting capacity of cables, in general and, therefore, of the cables that are the object of the present review.

The Secretariat analyzed the information submitted by Deacero and Camesa, and observed that, in 2020, the main steel wire rod producing countries in the world were China, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Germany, Japan, Italy and South Korea, while the main consuming countries were China, Germany, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Japan, Italy and South Korea. Mexico ranked ninth among the main producing countries and tenth among the main consuming countries. Additionally, it was observed that, in the period 2016 to 2020, the main exporting countries of steel wires and cables in the world, including those of pre-strengthening, were China, Italy, Germany, Korea, Russia and Czech Republic, while the main importing countries were the United States, Germany, Poland, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Mexico ranked 19th and 38th, respectively.

For the analysis of the international market, the Secretariat obtained statistics on world exports and imports corresponding to subheadings 7217.10 and 7312.10, reported by UN Comtrade, for the period from 2016 to 2020, given that these are the subheadings that correspond to the most restricted product range containing pre-stressed products.

The data indicate that world exports registered a cumulative decrease of 10%, going from 6,146 to 5,527 thousand tons from 2016 to 2020. In this regard, the Secretariat observed that, throughout the analyzed period, China remained the main world exporter, concentrating 25% of the total, followed by Italy with 9%, Germany with 6.4%, Korea with 5.8% and Belarus with 5%. Mexico ranked 16th with a share of 1.8% of the total.

For their part, world imports registered a cumulative decrease of 26%, going from 6,064 to 4,475 thousand tons, from 2016 to 2020. It was observed that, in the analyzed period, the main importers were the United States with a 12% share with respect to world imports, followed by Germany with 9%, Poland with 5% and France with 4%.

Domestic market

According to what is described in paragraphs 221, 222 and 223 of this Resolution, Deacero, Camesa and Republic Steel Wire are the only companies that produce pre-strengthening products in the domestic market.

Deacero indicated that its facilities are located in the State of Nuevo Leon, Camesa in Mexico City and the State of Mexico, and Republic Steel Wire in San Luis Potosi. They also indicated that domestic producers sell throughout Mexico, mainly through distributors and service centers, and that these same distribution channels are used by foreign suppliers that export reinforcing steel products to Mexico.

Deacero and Camesa indicated that the main consumers of prestressing products are manufacturers of post-tensioned and prestressed precast concrete structures and cable-stayed bridge construction companies, which are located throughout the country.

They assured that the demand for prestressing products remained unchanged during the period of validity of the antidumping duties, since there were no new consumer or demanding industries of the product; however, regarding the supply, they pointed out that the producer Republic Steel Wire, is a new plant of Grupo Simec, dedicated to the manufacture of special wires, in which prestressing wire is included, who started operations in 2020.

They added that, in view of the intensification of Chinese exports of steel products, the Mexican market of reinforcing steel products will receive significant quantities of the product under review, if the countervailing duties are eliminated, displacing not only the domestic production but also the rest of the imports.

They stated that, during the analyzed period, the domestic market of pre-stressing products was mainly supplied by the domestic industry, which observed a reduction of its production volumes to the domestic market.

Based on the economic indicators provided by the domestic industry and the import figures obtained from the list of import operations of the SIC-M, as indicated in points 247 to 249 of this Resolution, corresponding to the periods January to December 2016 to 2020, the Secretariat observed that the domestic market of pre-stressing products, measured through the CNA, calculated as the total domestic production plus imports minus exports, registered a drop during the analyzed period.

Indeed, it decreased 22%, 5% and 42% in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, but increased 11% in the period under review, which generated a cumulative decrease of 52% in the analyzed period. In this sense, the performance of the components of the NAC was as follows:

total imports decreased 78% in 2017, increased 43% and 7% in 2018 and 2019, respectively, and decreased 17% in the period under examination, thus accumulating a decrease of 72% in the analyzed period;

during the analyzed period, total imports of prestressing products were imported from eight countries. During the period under review, the main supplier was Tunisia, which represented 38% of total imports, followed by Thailand, Spain, Turkey and Brazil, with 23%, 18%, 16% and 4%, respectively;

domestic production registered a decrease of 17%, 7% and 39% in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively; and an increase of 15% in the period under review, which resulted in a cumulative decrease of 45% in the analyzed period; and

total exports increased 7% in 2017, decreased 12% in 2018, and increased 6% and 29% in 2019 and the period under examination, respectively, registering a cumulative growth of 29% in the analyzed period.

On the other handdomestic production oriented to the domestic market (calculated as total domestic production minus export sales), registered a decrease during the analyzed period of 51%, derived from a drop of 19%, 6% and 43% in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively; and an increase of 13% in the period under examination.

Actual and potential analysis on imports

Deacero and Camesa indicated that, in the period under review, pre-strengthening products were imported in marginal volumes and from sources of supply other than China, Spain and Portugal. Indeed, the imports examined accounted for 48%, 18.9%, 0.4%, 8.9% and 3.4% of total imports in the periods 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. With respect to the NAC, the imports examined from 2017 to 2020 accounted for less than one percentage point, imports from the rest of the world maintained an average share of 2.6% and, total imports decreased from 5.9% in 2016 to 2.5% in the review period.

CANACERO submitted a database obtained from SAT, with the list of import operations for tariff fractions 7217.10.99, 7312.10.01, 7312.10.05, 7312.10.07, 7312.10.08, 7312.10.10 and 7312.10.99 of the TIGIE, carried out in the period from 2016 to 2020. In this regard, Deacero and Camesa pointed out that through such tariff items enter a wide range of products other than the one under examination, for example: wires, slings, braces, clamps, tapes, whips, cords, stainless steel wire, electromechanical cable, annealed wire, copper wire; wire for clotheslines; wire for various uses, wire for cutting machines, for signs, for aircrafts, cables of various configurations, finishes and uses such as copper cables, brass-plated steel cables, stainless steel cables, copper-covered electric cables, automotive cables, harnesses, accessories for horns, aluminum angles, cable rings, auto parts, balance, balancer, rocker arm and any type of band, among others.

Therefore, CANACERO presented the following methodology to identify imports of reinforcing steel products originating from China, Spain and Portugal, as well as from other countries:

identified the import operations for each of the five years of the analysis period;

It classified as "Considered" the following import codes: A1, AF, C1, F3, G1 and IN, since they imply an entry of foreign merchandise into the country under a definitive or temporary regime, and as "Not Considered" the following import codes: A3, A4, AD, BA, BH, BO, C3, D1, F2, F4, F5, G9, H1, K1, P1, V1, V5, since they do not imply an actual entry of foreign merchandise into the country;

identified the origin of the imports, and

based on the description of the product, classified as product under examination "POE" the operations that coincide with "Presfuerzo", "Pretensado", "Post-tensado", as well as other similar names, and as product not under examination "PNOE" to different products or with a generic description that makes it impossible to determine if the product is the one under examination.

Considering the database and methodology presented by CANACERO, Deacero and Camesa assured that the examined imports originating in China, Spain and Portugal registered a substantial decrease during the analyzed period, in absolute terms of 98%, going from 1,246 tons in 2016 to 25 tons in 2020. They highlighted that, during the period under review, of the countries examined, only imports originating from Spain were recorded, in addition, during the entire period analyzed, no imports from Portugal were recorded.

In order to validate the methodology presented by CANACERO, the Secretariat obtained the list of import operations of the SIC-M, corresponding to the imports made through the tariff fractions 7217.10.99, 7312.10.01, 7312.10.05, 7312.10.07, 7312.10.08, 7312.10.10 and 7312.10.99 of the TIGIE; and made requests to customs agents corresponding to 141 pedimentos of import operations, with its corresponding invoice and documentation of internment, for the above mentioned tariff fractions; as well as requests to the seven main importers of the merchandise under examination; in addition to obtaining information from several Internet pages related to the industry of pre-stressed products.

Derived from the requirements referred to in the previous point, the Secretariat had 44 import petitions for the tariff fractions 7217.10.99, 7312.10.01, 7312.10.05, 7312.10.07, 7312.10.08, 7312.10.10 and 7312.10.99 of the TIGIE, originating from China, Spain and Portugal, as well as from the other origins, made during the analyzed period.

In this regard, the Secretariat analyzed the methodology referred to in paragraph 245 of this Resolution and considered that the criterion related to consider exclusively the operations that included descriptions of the product under examination, is correct, since it does not overestimate the volume of imports that correspond specifically to pre-stressed products. In addition, it excluded the import operations whose description corresponds to products other than pre-stressed products, among them those indicated in paragraph 244 of this Resolution and those of generic description that prevents to identify if the product is the one under examination. In addition, the Secretariat did not consider the import operations with customs declaration codes that could imply double counting (A4, BO, F2 and G9).

With the information indicated in points 247 to 249 of this Resolution, the Secretariat calculated the value and volume of imports of pre-stressed products, and observed that total imports decreased 72% throughout the analyzed period, observed a drop of 78% in 2017, increased 43% and 7% in 2018 and 2019, respectively, and registered a decrease of 17% in the period under examination.

Regarding the imports examined, it is noteworthy that, during the analyzed period, no imports originating from Portugal were registered, in addition, during the period under examination, no imports originating from China were registered either. In this sense, when analyzing their behavior, the Secretariat observed that these decreased 89% in the analyzed period, but grew 69% in the examination period, and meant 46%, 21%, 0.4%, 9% and 18% of the total imports in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and the examination period, respectively.

On the other hand, imports from other origins decreased 58% and 26% in the analyzed period and in the period under examination, respectively, however, in relative terms, their share in total imports throughout the analyzed period increased from a contribution of 54% in 2016 to 82% in 2020.

The Secretariat analyzed the participation of imports of prestressing products and domestic production oriented to the domestic market in the NAC throughout the analyzed period and observed that:

total imports participated in the NAC with 5.6%, 1.6%, 2.4%, 4.4% and 3.2% in 2016, 2017, 2018 2019 and the period under examination, respectively, which meant a decrease of 2.4 percentage points in the analyzed period;

The imports examined reached a participation in the NAC of 2.6%, 0.3%, 0.01%, 0.4% and 0.6% in 2016, 2017, 2018 2019 and the period under examination, respectively, so that cumulatively recorded a decrease of 2 percentage points in the analyzed period;

as for imports from other origins, they decreased their participation in the NAC by 0.3 percentage points in the analyzed period, going from 3% in 2016 to 2.7% in the period under examination (1.2% in 2017, 2.4% in 2018 and 4% in 2019), and

consequently, the national production oriented to the domestic market increased its share by 2.4 percentage points in the NAC in the analyzed period, going from a share of 94.4% to 96.8% (98.4% in 2017, 97.6% in 2018 and 95.6% in 2019).

With the information indicated in the previous point, the Secretariat confirmed what was stated by the domestic industry, regarding that, during the analyzed period, pre-strengthening products were imported in marginal volumes and from sources of supply other than China, Spain and Portugal.

Deacero and Camesa stated that, if the antidumping duties were eliminated, the low price level at which the product under review is imported would encourage the return of large volumes of the product under review to the Mexican market. They estimated that unfair imports would increase substantially to a volume of 3,210 tons in 2021 and 4,838 tons in 2022 (an additional increase of 50.6%).

In order to support their assertions, they presented their projections of the volume of imports of pre-stressed products from China, Spain, Portugal and other origins for 2021 and 2022, as well as their respective methodology, in a scenario of elimination of countervailing duties.

They estimated that, in a scenario of elimination of countervailing duties, the examined imports would increase to represent 11% and 16% of the NAC, in the projected periods 2021 and 2022, respectively, while imports from other origins would decrease to 1% and 0.1% of the NAC, in the same periods, since these are the shares that they registered in the periods prior to the investigated and investigated of the ordinary proceeding, when the countervailing duties were not yet in place.

Deacero and Camesa argued that the examined imports will repeat such behavior due to:

the persistence of unfair prices from the examined countries, they estimated an undervaluation margin of 20% for the examined period;

the domestic context of the examined countries indicates a weak demand for the placement of pre-strengthening products in those markets, so they will seek to place their production surpluses in other open markets, i.e., construction forecasts in Europe indicate a recovery until 2023 for Portugal, after stagnation in 2020, a growth of 2.3 and 2.5% in 2021 and 2022 for Spain, after a 12.5% drop in 2020, expected to grow 4.5 and 3.5%, and China is experiencing containment of its market which is expected to grow just 1% in 2021;

the restrictions on international trade in the reinforcement products of the countries under review, due to trade remedy measures maintained by countries such as the European Union and the United States, among others, make it foreseeable that the exportable surplus volume of the countries under review will be diverted to open markets such as the Mexican market, and

the federal government has launched a second package of infrastructure projects, with the participation of private investment, for which it is foreseen that the gross domestic product (GDP) of the construction sector, which is a demander of prestressing products, will have a growth of 2.3% and 3.6% in the projected periods 2021 and 2022, respectively, which would motivate the massive entry of imports of prestressing under dumping conditions if the countervailing measure were eliminated.

In the second evidentiary period, Camesa expanded its arguments and pointed out that, specifically, the pre-strengthening industry in China was boosted by the investment in infrastructure in the last years, however, the actual demand and consumption of steel have shown a significant downward trend and, consequently, an excess of capacity. The development of production exceeded the speed of demand, causing saturation of the Chinese market. In addition, the trade remedies that several countries have applied to Chinese exports represent a trade blockade for the placement of their surplus of reinforcing products. This condition will put pressure on the increase of Chinese sales of reinforcing products to the international market. The elimination of the countervailing duties would be an incentive to direct the excess production to the Mexican market, given the expected growth in the NAC in the projected periods.

The Secretariat analyzed and evaluated the methodology proposed by Deacero and Camesa, described in paragraph 257 of this Resolution and considered it acceptable, since the estimated volumes are feasible, since they are based on the level of imports from China, Spain, Portugal and other countries that existed when the antidumping duties were not yet applied.

By replicating the calculations that Deacero and Camesa provided on their estimates to project imports from China, Spain and Portugal, in the case of eliminating the countervailing duties, the Secretariat observed that subject imports would reach volumes that would allow them to have a share in the NAC of 11% in 2021 and 16% in 2022. This would reflect an increase in the market share of imports from China, Spain and Portugal in relation to the period under examination of 10.4 percentage points in 2021, and 15.4 percentage points in 2022; while the national production oriented to the domestic market would represent 88% of the NAC in 2021 and 83.9% in 2022, that is, a decrease of 8.8 percentage points in 2021, and 12.9 percentage points in 2022, in relation to the period under examination.

Based on the information and results of the analysis described above, the Secretariat concluded that there are sufficient elements to support that if the antidumping duties imposed on imports of pre-stressed products originating in China, Spain and Portugal were eliminated, there would be a considerable increase in dumped imports, which would displace domestic sales and, therefore, would reach a significant market share, which would negatively impact the performance of the relevant economic and financial indicators of the domestic industry.

Actual and potential price effects

Deacero and Camesa indicated that the prices of the domestic industry, during the period in which the antidumping duties were in force, although they showed increases, these occurred in a context of a significant increase in costs. They considered that the temporary nature of the countervailing duties has not been sufficient to counteract the injury caused, and therefore, if they were eliminated, the injury to the domestic industry would continue or repeat.

The Secretariat analyzed the behavior of the prices of the reinforcing products, for this purpose it considered the information in the administrative record, including the domestic prices of the sales to the domestic market made by the domestic industry and the prices of the imports of reinforcing products, the Secretariat determined to use the information of the volumes and values obtained as described in paragraphs 247 to 249 of this Resolution, since it was the best information available, due to the fact that the information contained in the database of the list of import operations of the SIC-M corresponding to the tariff sections 7217.10.99, 7312.10.01, 7312.10.05, 7312.10.07, 7312.10.08, 7312.10.10, 7312.10.10 and 7312.10.99 of the TIGIE, is obtained after validation of the customs pedimentos that occur in a framework of information exchange between customs agents and customs agents, on the one hand, and the customs authority on the other, which is reviewed by the Banco de México and, therefore, is considered as the best information available.

Based on the information described above, the Secretariat observed that the implicit average price of imports of the product under review registered the following behavior throughout the analyzed period: it grew 20% and 2 times in 2017 and 2018, respectively, and decreased 71% and 14% in 2019 and the period under review, respectively, which meant a cumulative decrease of 11% in the analyzed period. On the other hand, the implicit average price of imports from other origins increased 19%, 14% and 0.3% in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, and decreased 11% in the period under examination, accumulating an increase of 20% in the analyzed period.

On the other hand, the Secretariat observed that the average sales price to the domestic market of the domestic industry, measured in dollars, increased 4%, 18% and 7% in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, and decreased 14% in the period under examination, accumulating a growth of 13% in the analyzed period.

In order to evaluate the existence of undercutting, the Secretariat considered the price of sales to the domestic market of the domestic industry and compared it with the average price recorded by the imports examined during the analyzed period, adjusted with the tariff, customs clearance duty and customs agent expenses, as well as the payment of antidumping duties.

The Secretariat observed that the average price of the imports examined, was below the national price with an undervaluation level of 4% in 2016, 10% and 143% above in 2017 and 2018, respectively; while, in 2019 and the period under examination, an undervaluation of 24% and 21%, respectively, was registered. In this sense, it stands out that the price of the imports examined decreased 11% in the analyzed period, while the national price increased 13%.

In relation to the average price of imports from other origins, the price of the product under examination was 17%, 18% and 170% above in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, while, in 2019 and the period under examination it was 9.5% and 9.2% below, respectively.

Prices of imports and domestic product

Deacero and Camesa estimated that, under a scenario of elimination of antidumping duties, the price of their sales to the domestic market, for the projected periods 2021 and 2022, would be the quotient of the projected price of the imports under examination between the difference of the unit minus the margin of undervaluation in 2020, which they estimated at 20.08%, which would remain constant in 2021 and 2022. The price of the domestic industry, measured in pesos, would decrease 3.9% and 1.7% in 2021 and 2022, respectively.

They pointed out that the mechanism transmitting the injury to the domestic industry is through prices, since the unfair prices of the potential imports examined would depress the prices of the domestic industry. Camesa estimated an undercutting margin, with respect to its prices, of 20.35%; therefore, its prices, expressed in pesos, would fall 3.9% and 1.7%, in 2021 and 2022, respectively; andDeacero estimated an undervaluation margin of 19.5% that would cause a deterioration in its sales price to the domestic market of 3.8% in 2021.

The price of the imports examined in 2021 would be the average price of the three countries examined, in 2020, where the price of Spain was obtained from the statistical information of SAT, while the price of China and Portugal, in the absence of imports in the period of examination, as referred to in point 251 of this Resolution, was obtained from the information of 90% of their total exports, from the Penta-Transaction database, and adjusted for freight and insurance to place them at the Mexican customs level. For 2022 they estimated that, it would be the sum of values between the sum of volume, both of the periods 2017-2021.

Regarding the prices of the product originating from other countries, based on SAT statistics, they estimated that they would be the sum of values between the sum of volume, of the analyzed period for 2021, and of the period 2017 to 2021, for the projected period 2022.

The Secretariat considered adequate the methodology that Deacero and Camesa used to estimate the prices of the imports of prestressing products originating from China, Spain, Portugal, other countries and the domestic prices, since they are based on previously observed figures, that is, the price of the imports examined in 2021, would reflect the price level observed during the period of examination; the price of the examined imports in 2022 and the price of imports from other origins would reflect the price level observed during the five previous periods, and the domestic prices would reflect the level of undercutting observed during the period of examination.

The Secretariat replicated the calculations that Deacero and Camesa made for their estimates and observed that, if the antidumping duties were eliminated, the price of the examined imports, in the projected periods of 2021 and 2022, would be below the domestic price by 23%, respectively.

Based on the evidence in the administrative record and the analysis described above, the Secretariat concluded that there is a reasonable probability that, if the antidumping duties were eliminated, the imports of pre-stressed products from China, Spain and Portugal would enter the domestic market at price levels that would have a negative impact on the domestic prices in the internal market, This would force the domestic industry to contain its prices in order to be able to compete and would increase the demand for new imports, which would have negative effects on sales to the domestic market and its income, affecting the profits of the domestic industry.

Actual and potential effects on the domestic industry

Deacero and Camesa indicated that, in the analyzed period, the domestic industry operated in a context of reduction of its domestic market, measured as the ANC, with a modest improvement in the period of examination that did not allow reaching the market volume observed at the beginning of the antidumping duties. They pointed out that, during the analyzed period, the industry of precast concrete structures, user and plaintiff of the pre-strengthening products in the domestic market, contracted. The above was reflected in the CNA of the pre-strengthening products, which in the period under review, with figures presented in the first evidentiary period, was 51.5% below the CNA of 2016, the year in which the definitive duties were imposed.

To support their claims, Deacero and Camesa submitted figures of their main economic indicators, for each of the years included in the analyzed period.

In response to the Secretariat's requirement, Deacero updated its installed capacity figures, after reviewing the specifications of its machines. It clarified that the inventory figures it submitted are correct, since the sum of initial inventories and production for the period, in addition to total sales, it subtracted "Outputs by transfer", "Other outgoing scales" and other concepts. In addition, it presented its employment and salary figures, broken down into direct and indirect, and corrected the figures for sales to main customers. Camesa, on the other hand, corrected its production and inventory figures for the analyzed period, and also presented its employment and wages figures, disaggregated in direct and indirect.

They added that, in the analyzed period, the market of pre-stressing products was mainly supplied by the domestic industry, which observed a reduction of its production volumes to the domestic market, fact that reflects the state of vulnerability that could continue in the immediate future, since the evolution of the economy to the first quarter of 2021 did not show signs of reactivation in secondary activities, where the construction sector, consumer of pre-stressing products, is located. The domestic sales and production of the period after the period of examination, in a circumstance of elimination of antidumping duties, would generate the continuation or recurrence of the injury to the domestic industry, causing the unfeasible continuation of its operations.

In order to evaluate the behavior of the domestic industry throughout the analyzed period, the Secretariat considered the economic indicators provided by Deacero and Camesa. In order to analyze the financial situation, operating results and cash flow of the domestic industry, the Secretariat used the audited financial statements submitted by Deacero and Camesa. In addition, it reviewed the operating results of the like product through statements of costs, sales and profits, corresponding to the domestic market, as well as statements of unit costs for the years 2016 to 2020.

The Secretariat updated the financial information through the method of changes in the general price level using the National Consumer Price Index determined by the National Institute of Geography and Statistics.

Based on the information described above, the Secretariat observed that, the national production branch registered a contraction of production in the analyzed period in the order of 51%, mainly explained by the negative behavior of 2017, 2018 and 2019 in which it fell 17%, 7% and 39%, respectively, to later observe a slight recovery of 3% in the period under examination.

On the other hand, the production oriented to the domestic market of the domestic industry followed a behavior similar to that of its production, although of a greater magnitude by reducing its volume 56% in the analyzed period, registering reductions practically throughout the analyzed period in the order of 19%, 6% and 43% in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, and a recovery of only 1% in the period under examination.

In terms of market share, the Secretariat observed that the production oriented to the domestic market of the domestic industry lost 7.5 percentage points of participation in the NAC during the analyzed period, going from 94.4% in 2016 to 86.9% in the examination period, while the imports examined decreased their participation in the NAC 2% in the same periods, going from a contribution of 2.6% to 0.6%, respectively, and imports originating from other countries decreased their participation 0.3% by going from representing 3% of the NAC in 2016 to 2.7% in the examination period. The above, reflects that in the context of a 52% contraction in the NAC in the analyzed period, the production oriented to the domestic market of the domestic industry was the one that lost the most participation in the domestic market.

The behavior in the volume of the domestic industry's production was reflected in the performance of its total sales (to the domestic and foreign market), which also accumulated a drop of 51% in the analyzed period: they decreased 17%, 9%, 34% and 1% in 2017, 2018, 2019 and the period under review, respectively.

The Secretariat observed that the performance recorded by the total sales of the domestic industry is explained by the behavior of sales to the domestic market:

sales to the domestic market registered a decreasing trend during the analyzed period: they decreased 19%, 8%, 38% and 4% in 2017, 2018, 2019 and in the period under examination, which meant a cumulative decrease of 56% in the analyzed period;

on the other hand, exports increased 7% in 2017, decreased 12% in 2018, but increased 6% and 16% in 2019 and in the period under review, so that they accumulated an increase of 16% in the analyzed period; and

in relative terms, sales to the domestic market represented on average 88% of production in the analyzed period, which indicates that the domestic industry is oriented to a greater extent to the domestic market, in which it would compete with the imports of the product under review in conditions of dumping, if the countervailing duties were eliminated.

The installed capacity of the domestic industry to produce pre-stressed products remained unchanged during the analyzed period. As a result of the performance of installed capacity and production, the utilization of the first indicator decreased 35 percentage points in the analyzed period, going from 69% in 2016 to 34% in the period under review.

The inventories of the domestic industry decreased 8% in 2017, increased 39% in 2018, decreased 56% in 2019 and increased 17% in the period under examination, so that cumulatively they recorded a decrease of 33% in the analyzed period.

The employment of the domestic industry registered a decreasing trend throughout the analyzed period by decreasing 12%, 7%, 29% and 11% in 2017, 2018, 2019 and the period under examination, respectively, which meant a cumulative reduction of 48% in the analyzed period.

The productivity of the domestic industry decreased 5% in 2017, grew 0.4% in 2018, decreased 14% in 2019 and increased 16% in the period under examination, which meant a cumulative decrease of 5% in the analyzed period.

The behavior of the wage bill of the domestic industry showed a decrease of 14% in 2017, an increase of 5% in 2018, and reductions of 3% and 13% in 2019 and in the period under examination, respectively.

The cumulative decrease was 24% in the period under review.

As indicated in paragraph 281 of this Resolution, Deacero and Camesa submitted statements of costs, sales and profits of similar merchandise sold in the domestic market corresponding to the production and sale of pre-stressing products. It should be noted that the volume of sales in the export market, with respect to the volume produced, only represented an average of 11% in the period of analysis and 17% in the period under examination, so the Secretariat considered only analyzing the financial results for sales in the domestic market.

As a result of the behavior of sales volumes in the domestic market and domestic prices, the Secretariat observed that sales revenues increased 5% in 2018, but decreased 20%, 36% and 11% in 2017, 2019 and the period under examination, respectively, which reflected a cumulative decrease of 52% during the analyzed period. On the other hand, operating or operating costs (cost of sales plus operating expenses) decreased 9%, 2%, 33% and 13% in 2017, 2018, 2019 and the period under review, respectively, which reflected a cumulative decrease of 48% during the period under review.

As a result of the behavior of sales revenues and operating costs in the domestic market, noted in the previous point, the operating results decreased 0.81 and 0.6 times in 2017 and 2019, respectively, but increased 1.84 and 0.18 times in 2018 and the period under review, respectively, which was reflected in a decrease in operating profit of 0.75 times during the entire period under review.

Meanwhile, the operating margin for sales in the domestic market decreased 12.2 and 3.8 percentage points in 2017 and 2019, respectively increased 6.4 and 2 percentage points in 2018 and the period under examination, respectively, so that cumulatively decreased 7.6 percentage points from a margin of 15.9% to 8.3% during the entire period analyzed.

Deacero and Camesa stated that the prices in the domestic market only recovered to the extent of the increase in their production costs. In this regard, and as stated in paragraph 281 of this Resolution, both companies submitted statements of unit costs of production and sales, in pesos per kilogram, for pre-stressing products. The Secretariat weighted the information of the unit costs of the companies based on the production volumes, obtaining the unit costs per kilogram of the national industry. In this sense, the Secretariat was able to verify what the national industry indicated, since the prices in the domestic market for the period under examination decreased in real terms 7.1% (including the effects of inflation), while the unit costs decreased 5.6%; on the other hand, for the analyzed period, the national prices increased in real terms 9.4%, while the unit costs increased 14.8%.

Regarding the variables of return on investment in assets (ROA), contribution of the like product to the ROA, cash flow and ability to raise capital, in accordance with articles 3.6 of the Antidumping Agreement and 66 of the RLCE, the effects of imports were evaluated based on the audited financial statements of the domestic industry, which consider the production of the most restricted group or range of products that include the like product under examination.

Deacero and Camesa did not indicate the existence of investments or projects associated with the production of similar merchandise.

Regarding the return on investment ROA and the contribution of the like product to the ROA of the domestic industry, calculated at the operating level, it was positive with a downward trend during the analyzed period, as detailed below:

From the cash flow statements of the companies that make up the domestic industry, it is possible to observe that cash flow at the operating level reported a mixed behavior during the years 2016 to 2020. The operating cash flow reflected, with respect to each previous year, the following movements: decrease of 2.31 times in 2017, increase of 1.88 times in 2018 and 1.14 times in 2019, and a decrease of 0.48 times in the period under examination, so that, in the analyzed period, it reported an increase of 0.28 times in cash flow.

The ability to raise capital is analyzed through the behavior of the solvency, liquidity, leverage and debt ratios. Below is a summary of the performance of these indicators during the period under analysis:

From the above, it is observed that solvency and liquidity levels retained satisfactory levels, even under the acid test, that is, current assets minus the value of inventories, in relation to short-term liabilities; in general, solvency and liquidity levels are considered adequate if the ratio of current assets to short-term liabilities is one to one or greater.

The leverage ratio has remained at unmanageable levels during 2016 to 2020. Normally, a ratio of total liabilities to stockholders' equity of less than 100% is considered manageable; in this case, leverage levels did not show this condition. As for the level of debt or total liabilities to total assets ratio, it remained at acceptable levels, i.e., below 100%.

Based on the analysis described in the previous paragraphs, the Secretariat observed that, although the antidumping duties contained the growth of the imports examined in the analyzed period, some of the economic indicators of the domestic industry showed negative signs, such as a decrease in production, production oriented to the domestic market, sales to the domestic market, productivity, utilization of the installed capacity, employment, salaries and income from sales to the domestic market. Likewise, financial profits were observed at the operating level of the domestic industry for sales in the domestic market of prestressing products, but with a downward trend during the analyzed period. Therefore, the Secretariat considered that the state of the domestic industry in the analyzed period is vulnerable to the elimination of the antidumping duties.

In the first probationary period, the domestic industry assured that, in a scenario of elimination of countervailing duties, the following results would be observed:

the participation of the domestic production oriented to the internal market would decrease, going from 98% of the NAC in the examination period to 88% and 84% in the projected periods 2021 and 2022, respectively;

sales to the domestic market would also decrease their contribution to the NAC by 9 percentage points, going from 93% in the examination period to 84% in 2021 and 13 percentage points in 2022, with respect to the examination period;

the volume of domestic production would suffer an estimated decrease of 5.3% and 5.1%, as compared to the examination period;

the volume of sales to the domestic market would fall 7.6% and 8.8% in the projected periods 2021 and 2022, with respect to the observed in the periodreview period;

the use of installed capacity of the domestic industry would decrease by 2 percentage points, going from 34% in the 2020 review period to 32% in the 2021 and 2022 forecast periods;

employment in the 2021 and 2022 projection periods would fall by 23% and 24%, respectively; and

in terms of prices, given the wide margin of undervaluation of the prices of the investigated merchandise with respect to the price of the domestic homologous merchandise, they estimated, in the projected periods 2021 and 2022, a drop in the sales price to the domestic market of 7% and 5% in relation to the period 2020 which, in a context of an important increase in the costs of the period, such drop would imply registering inadequate levels of profitability, which if it persists, would lead to the non-viability of the manufacture of pre-stressed products and the eventual closing of the same.

To support their assertions, Deacero and Camesa presented projections of their main economic indicators for 2021 and 2022, in case the antidumping duties were eliminated, as well as their methodology and criteria applied in their estimates:

their exports would be the average growth rate of the period analyzed for 2021, and of the period 2017 to 2021 for 2022;

based on the report "Situación Regional Sectorial México" of the BBVA Bank, they considered that the NAC would have a growth of 2.3% and 3.6% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, since this is the estimate that the bank has for the GDP of the construction industry, consumer of pre-stressing products;

domestic production would be obtained by differentiating projected imports from NAC, and adding projected exports;

domestic production oriented to the domestic market would be obtained by subtracting projected exports from domestic production;

the volume of sales to the domestic market would be reduced in the same proportion as domestic production oriented to the domestic market in the projected period;

the price of sales to the domestic market would maintain the margin of undervaluation observed in the period examined;

inventories would have the turnover observed in the period examined;

installed capacity would remain constant during the forecast period;

employment would maintain the productivity observed in the period under review, and wages would increase in the same proportion as in the period under review.

wages would increase in the same proportion as the minimum wage determined by the National Minimum Wage Commission (CONASAMI) for 2021.

In the second probationary period, Deacero and Camesa indicated that, under the scenario of elimination of antidumping duties, the domestic industry's sales revenue would decrease 11.2% and 10.3%, in the projected periods 2021 and 2022, respectively.

Deacero indicated that, if the antidumping duties were eliminated, it would observe a deterioration in the volume of production, sales to the domestic market and employment; while Camesa indicated that the elimination of the duties would result in a negative effect on its projected economic and financial indicators, via volume, as a consequence of the foreseeable growth in the volume of the imports examined at dumped prices and via price, as a consequence of the significant margins of price undervaluation of the potential imports examined in the projected periods. This would generate a reduction in the volume of sales volume to the domestic market of 7.6% and 8.7% in the projected periods 2021 and 2022, respectively; production would contract 5.2% and 5.0%, the use of installed capacity would decrease 2.6 and 2.5 percentage points, employment would decrease 5.2% and 5.0%, and the income from sales in the domestic market would decrease 11% and 10% in the same projected periods. Such negative operating results would make it impossible to sustain the productive operation of pre-stressed products in the immediate future.

The Secretariat analyzed the methodology presented by Deacero and Camesa to project the economic indicators of the domestic industry and considered it acceptable, since it is fundamentally based on the expected behavior of the domestic market in the near future, which takes into account the expected growth of the construction industry, consumer of the pre-strengthening products, and on the volumes that the imports of this product would reach, including those originating from the countries examined under dumping conditions, as well as on the behavior and participation of its economic indicators during the analyzed period.

Regarding the methodology to project the financial variables, Deacero and Camesa presented projections of their operating results for the years 2021 and 2022, under the scenario without the continuation of the antidumping duties on imports of pre-stressed products. Regarding the unit costs and expenses for sales in the domestic market, these were projected with actual information of the period under review (average unit costs) plus the corresponding growth rates of unit costs and expenses during the period analyzed, multiplied by the projected sales volumes for 2021 and 2022, thus obtaining the total sales costs and operating expenses. In this regard, the Secretariat evaluated the information submitted and considered reasonable the assumptions, parameters and methodology used by the domestic industry for the projection of its operating results without the continuation of the antidumping duties in force.

Based on the results of the analysis referred to in points 310 and 311 of this Resolution, the Secretariat replicated the projections of the domestic industry for 2021 and 2022, with respect to the levels that were registered in the period of examination, and observed that they would reflect the following effects in the relevant economic indicators of the industry: decreases in production (4.7% and 4.5%), production oriented to the domestic market (6.6% and 7.1%), market share (7.6 and 10.7 percentage points), sales to the domestic market (7% and 8.1%), employment (4.7% and 4.5%) and utilization of installed capacity (1.6 and 1.5 percentage points).

Based on the financial information projected by the domestic industry, under the scenario without the continuation of the antidumping duties, and on the situation of decreasing sales volumes in the domestic market and domestic prices for 2021 and 2022, in comparison with the operating results obtained in the period under examination, the Secretariat observed decreases in the operating profit of the domestic industry by 1.68 and 2.19 times (even becoming operating loss) for 2021 and 2022, respectively, this as a result of the decrease in sales revenues of 13% and 12% in the referred projection years, respectively. Meanwhile, operating costs for 2021 and 2022 would increase 1% and 7%, respectively, which would result in reductions of 14.8 and 19.6 percentage points in the operating margin to -6.5% and -11.3% for the referred projection years, respectively.

Based on the information and the results of the analysis described above, the Secretariat concluded that the potential volumes of imports from China, Spain and Portugal, as well as the price level at which they would enter the Mexican market, constitute objective elements that allow establishing the reasonable probability that upon the elimination of the antidumping duties, the domestic industry would register negative effects on the relevant economic and financial indicators, which would result in the repetition of the injury to the domestic industry of the pre-strengthening products.

Export potential of China, Spain and Portugal

Deacero and Camesa presented figures of production, exports, imports, domestic consumption and installed capacity of prestressing products of the countries examined, for the analyzed period, obtained from the "report on the domestic markets of steel strand for prestressed concrete in Spain and Portugal" of the consulting firm UNO, Trade Map, the SAT import database provided by CANACERO, the 2020 Annual Report of the company Silvery Dragon, the consultation of Internet pages of 12 Chinese companies and the article "Status Quo and Development Trend of Prestressed Steel Strand" published in the Chinese magazine "Metallurgical Engineering".

In response to the Secretariat's requirement, Deacero provided an estimate of the production and installed capacity of China, Spain and Portugal, for the analyzed period, however, in the second evidentiary period, Camesa updated the specific estimates for China, pointing out that this country has 70 manufacturers of prestressed steel strand, whose production exceeded 6 million tons of prestressed products in 2018. In addition, that the company Silvery Dragon recorded a production of 383,404 tons and an installed capacity of 600,000 tons in 2020.

In response to the requirement formulated by the Secretariat, corresponding to the second evidentiary period, Camesa corrected Silvery Dragon's production figure to 391,330 tons. With such figures, and assuming that China's capacity is at least its production, and that Silvery Dragon's capacity is representative at 10% of China's capacity, Camesa calculated Silvery Dragon's installed capacity utilization and assumed that it is the same for all of China in 2018. It also assumed that, its estimate of China's capacity for 2018 is extensive to the entire period analyzed and that the ratio of exports to Chinese production is constant throughout the period analyzed.

With such information, it estimated that the examined countries had a production of 2.6 million tons and a potential additional production volume of 6.8 million tons, in the period under examination. Therefore, the production is 91 times the size of Mexico's NAC, and the additional production potential would represent 240 times the NAC, in the same period.

Deacero and Camesa pointed out that there are 25 anti-dumping measures in force against pre-stress products from the investigated countries, noting that recently the United States extended the countervailing measures against Chinese pre-stress products and that the government of Malaysia initiated an anti-dumping investigation against pre-stress products of the same origin, without omitting the transitional anti-dumping investigation initiated by the United Kingdom against imports of reinforcing steel products also of Chinese origin and the one carried out by the United States against 15 countries, including Spain.

In the second evidentiary period, Deacero pointed out that, the International Trade Administration (ITA) published the final resolution of the second five-year review of the investigation against imports originating in China where it determined that, in case of the elimination of the tax on imports of prestressing products, it would result in the continuation or repetition of the subsidies granted by the Chinese government to prestressing products. Therefore, it is confirmed that China continues to grant subsidies to the industry of pre-stressed products, and if Mexico eliminates the countervailing duties on imports from China, it could lead to a detour of trade of Chinese exports from the U.S. market to the Mexican market, with consequent damage to the domestic industry.

It also indicated that China, Spain and Portugal have a large exporting capacity. However, their exports registered a decrease of 885 million kilograms in 2020 with respect to 2016, and a decrease of more than 1,000 million kilograms in 2020 with respect to 2019. This implies that some markets are closing or demanding less volumes of pre-stressed products, so it is evident that the investigated countries will redirect their production volumes to other export markets, particularly to those that are open and have higher growth expectations, which would be the case of the Mexican market.

Based on the information described in the previous points, which constitutes the best information available, the Secretariat observed the following:

the figures of the production capacity of only twelve Chinese companies producing prestressing products, of which Deacero and Camesa submitted information for 2020, indicate that they have the capacity to produce more than 243 times the equivalent of the size of the Mexican market that was reported during the period under examination, likewise, such production capacity represented more than 79 times the installed capacity of the domestic industry, in the same period;

In accordance with points 231 and 232 of this Resolution, the Secretariat obtained the export statistics of the tariff subheadings 7217.10 and 7312.10 obtained from UN Comtrade, which include the product under examination, from which it observed that exports of prestressed products from China, Spain and Portugal to the world increased 3% in 2017 and 2018, respectively, 6% in 2019 and, in the period under examination; when the sanitary contingency caused by COVID-19 occurred, they decreased 14%, accumulating a reduction of 4% in the analyzed period. Exports under review went from 1,672 to 1,597 thousand tons, however, its share in world exports increased 2 percentage points from 27% in 2016 to 29% in the period under review. It is noteworthy that, throughout the period under analysis, China remained the main exporter of pre-strengthening products worldwide with an average share of 25%;

In relation to the Mexican market during the period under review, the exports of reinforcing products examined represented more than 47 times the production of Mexico and more than 55 times the NAC of reinforcing products;

Exports examined vs. domestic market

With respect to steel wire rod, the primary input of the product under review, according to CRU statistics, China remained the main world producer of steel wire rod throughout the period analyzed, with an average share of 67%, well above other countries such as Germany, Japan and Italy, which had average shares of less than 3% in the same period. China's production of steel wire rod in the period under review was 166.5 million tons, representing a share of 70% of world production, while Spain's production was 2.4 million tons, representing 1% of world production;

China's export potential for this input, in the period examined, measured as the difference between its production and consumption, represented more than 49 times the size of Mexico's NAC of pre-strengthening products, and that of Spain, more than 24 times;

the above figures show that the countries examined are important producers of the primary input of the product under review, which could be used for the manufacture and export of pre-stressed products to the Mexican market, if the countervailing duties were eliminated; and

the existence of 25 antidumping measures to the products of the examined countries, as well as the extension of countervailing measures by the United States, allows to presume that the exporters of the examined countries would have an incentive to place their exports in other countries, such as the Mexican market.

Based on the information and analysis described above, the Secretariat concluded that the industries of the examined countries, manufacturers of pre-strengthening products, have a considerable production level and export potential in relation to the national production and the size of the Mexican market of the like product. The above, together with the low prices at which they would compete due to the dumping conditions in which they would enter the domestic market, constitute elements to determine that, in case the antidumping duties were eliminated, they would encourage the entry of exports of pre-stressed products to the Mexican market in significant volumes, which would result in the repetition of the injury to the domestic industry.

Conclusions

Based on the analysis and the results described in this Resolution, the Secretariat concluded that there are sufficient elements to determine that the elimination of the antidumping duties on imports of PS products from China, Spain and Portugal would lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury to the domestic industry. Among the elements that led to this conclusion, without limiting the aspects that were pointed out throughout this Determination, are the following:

There are sufficient elements to support that if the antidumping duties were eliminated, dumping would continue or be repeated in the exports to Mexico of pre-strengthening products originating from China, Spain and Portugal.

Notwithstanding the fact that, during the period under analysis, the application of the countervailing duties discouraged the presence of the imports under examination, the projection of the imports under examination before the elimination of the countervailing duties, confirms the reasonable probability that they would again enter the domestic market in considerable volumes that would allow them to reach a market share that would negatively impact the performance of relevant economic and financial indicators of the domestic industry.

The price of potential imports of prestressing products from China, Spain and Portugal could reach significant margins of undercutting with respect to the domestic price of 23% in 2021 and 2022.

Given the prices at which the imports of the reinforcing products originating in China, Spain and Portugal would compete, it is foreseeable that they would significantly displace the domestic product from the market, which would negatively affect the performance of the relevant economic and financial indicators of the domestic industry.

During the analyzed period, some of the economic indicators showed negative signs, such as a decrease in production, production oriented to the domestic market, sales to the domestic market, productivity, utilization of installed capacity, employment, wages and income from sales to the domestic market. For this reason, the Secretariat considered that the state of the industrydomestic industry in the analyzed period is vulnerable to the elimination of the countervailing duties.

Among the most important effects on the domestic industry that would be caused by the elimination of the antidumping duties in the projected periods 2021 and 2022, with respect to the levels registered in the period of examination, are decreases in production (4.7% and 4.5%), production oriented to the domestic market (6.6% and 7.1%), market share (7.6 and 10.7 percentage points), sales to the domestic market (7% and 8.1%), employment (4.7% and 4.5%) and utilization of the installed capacity (1.6 and 1.5 percentage points).6 and 1.5 percentage points); on the other hand, the operating results corresponding to the domestic market would show a decrease of 1.68 and 2.19 times for 2021 and 2022, due to the fact that sales revenues would decrease 13% and 12% in the projected periods, while operating costs would grow 1% and 7%, which would result in a drop of 14.8 and 19.6 percentage points in the operating margin, at -6.5% and -11.3% for the projected periods of 2021 and 2022, respectively.

The countries examined have significant export potential in relation to the production and size of the Mexican market for pre-strengthening products. In particular, during the period under review, the exports of reinforcing products examined represented more than 47 times Mexico's domestic production and more than 55 times the NAC of reinforcing products.

During the entire period analyzed, China remained in the first place of the main exporting countries of reinforcing products; during the period examined, its exports represented 25% of the total exports, placing it as the main exporter of such products worldwide. Portugal and Spain ranked eighth and thirteenth in the world, respectively, during the same period.

The existence of 25 antidumping measures on the products of the countries examined, as well as the extension of countervailing measures by the United States, allows presuming that China, Spain and Portugal would have an incentive to place their exports in other countries, such as the Mexican market.

Therefore, based on articles 11.1 and 11.3 of the Antidumping Agreement, and articles 67, 70, section II, and 89 F, section IV, literal a, of the LCE, the following is hereby issued

RESOLUTION

The administrative procedure for the review of the validity of the antidumping duties imposed to the imports of pre-strengthening products, originating from the People's Republic of China, the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic, independently of the country of origin, that enter through the tariff sections 7217.10.02, 7312.10.01, 7312.10.05, 7312.10.07, 7312.10.08 and 7312.10.99 of the TIGIE, or through any other, is declared concluded.

The validity of the definitive countervailing duties referred to in point 1 of this Resolution is extended for five more years, starting on February 27, 2021.

The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit is responsible for applying the definitive countervailing duties referred to in paragraph 1 of this Resolution throughout the national territory.

Pursuant to the provisions of article 66 of the LCE, the importers that according to this Resolution must pay the antidumping duties, will not be obligated to pay them if they prove that the country of origin of the merchandise is different from China, Spain and Portugal. The verification of the origin of the merchandise will be made in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement that establishes the rules for the determination of the country of origin of the imported merchandise and the provisions for its certification, for non-preferential effects (formerly Agreement that establishes the rules for the determination of the country of origin of the imported merchandise and the provisions for its certification, in the matter of countervailing duties) published in the DOF on August 30, 1994, and its amendments published in the same publication on November 11, 1996, October 12, 1998, July 30, 1999, June 30, 2000, March 1 and 23, 2001, June 29, 2001, September 6, 2002, May 30, 2003, July 14, 2004, May 19, 2005, July 17, 2008 and October 16, 2008.

The winning aura that, at Finalissima level, kept the Argentine National Team was cut in Futsal. This Thursday, at the Mary Terán de Weiss stadium in Parque Roca, the Albiceleste team suffered the effectiveness of Spain, which won 3-0 to meet Portugal, which overcame Paraguay (2-1), in next Sunday's final, in the first edition of this event in relation to this sport.

The team coached by Matías Lucuix, runner-up in the World Cup and reigning champion of America, was accompanied by more than 6 thousand people in the stadium located in Villa Soldati, but wasted the chances it had against one of the best teams in the world, which came to this tournament as third in the European Championship (Russia, the second, does not participate due to UEFA's sanction).

The captain of the "Roja" Raúl Campos was the author of the two goals that opened the match in the first half, both after capturing rebounds inside the area and scoring into an empty net, after a bad luck in Argentina's defense.

The Albiceleste tried their best, even with goalkeeper player, but could not beat goalkeepers Jesús Herrero and Dídac Plana, who came on in the second half and sealed the score with a last-second goal-to-goal shot.

The image of Argentina, beyond the result, was good, as it generated several situations, mainly in the first half, but the match, which was witnessed by the president of AFA, Claudio Chiqui Tapia, became more and more difficult for them as they failed to score.

La Albiceleste still has never beaten Spain in its history, having only managed a draw (in a friendly match prior to the 2021 World Cup) in nine meetings so far.

Argentina started with Nicolás Sarmiento; Pablo Taborda, Ángel Claudino, Lucas Bolo Alemany and Alan Brandi.

Then, Lucas Tripodi, Maximiliano Rescia, Sebastián Corso, Gerardo Menseguez, Santiago Basile, Cristian Borruto, Constantino Vaporaki and Matías Edelstein entered the team. The only player who did not play minutes was substitute goalkeeper Matías Starna.

In the first round, Portugal fulfilled the logic and got into the final of the tournament after beating Paraguay by 2 to 1, although they had to come back from behind in the second half. The Paraguayans took the lead thanks to Daniel Ozuna -a Racing de Avellaneda player-, but the Portuguese reacted thanks to Pany Varela and goalkeeper Gio González against.

On Sunday, Argentina will go for the bronze medal against Paraguay at 14:00, while Portugal and Spain will replay the semi-final of the last European Championship at 16:30.

Abramovich, new Portuguese under investigation

Roman Abramovich, former owner of Chelsea and a figure close to Vladimir Putin, used the Portuguese Nationality Law to become Portuguese, claiming a Sephardic origin. But Lisbon is already investigating how the Russian billionaire managed to become a Lusitanian, as he allegedly violated several procedures. Against the backdrop of the invasion of Ukraine, the investigation covers other Russian millionaires and even the rabbi of the Hebrew Community of Porto, who was arrested.

MEXICO CITY (Proceso) - The Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich is the richest Portuguese in the world. So ironized the press after the Portuguese newspaper Público uncovered that the multimillionaire obtained nationality and an official passport through procedures today subject to judicial investigation, taking advantage of the path opened by the Nationality Law for the descendants of the former Sephardic Jewish community expelled from Portugal in 1496 by King Manuel I.

This law allows since 2015 to nationalize as Portuguese the descendants of this community - upon accrediting their lineage, among other requirements - who were expelled from that country, four years after the Catholic Monarchs also forced the Sephardim to leave the territories of the crowns of Aragon and Castile(Proceso 2376).

The scandal of Abramovich, ex-owner of the English soccer club Chelsea, owner of five of the most luxurious superyachts in the world, a fleet of jets and a fortune that Bloomberg estimates at 13.9 billion dollars, led the Portuguese justice system to intensify in March the investigation into the way in which he obtained his nationality.

It was the time when, after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine last February 20, the Russian oligarchs were in the focus of world attention due to the sanctions imposed on them by Western countries for their close ties with Vladimir Putin's regime.

The Portuguese newspaper published its investigation on December 18 ("Roman Abramovich has been a Portuguese citizen since April," it headlined) and in January the Portuguese Attorney General's Office launched an investigation when it detected possible irregularities in the processing of this and other files to facilitate nationality under the criterion of the historical background of Iberian Jews, in which crimes such as influence peddling, corruption, falsification of documents, money laundering, tax fraud and criminal association could have been committed.

As a result of this scandal, the Portuguese government made amendments to the Nationality Law to tighten the requirements for obtaining nationality through the Sephardic route. "Since September 1, new requirements have come into force that applicants must meet," including speaking the language, demonstrating that they have real ties with the country, including properties or investments in its territory, explains lawyer Neyvi Tolentino, a specialist in immigration issues, to Proceso.

Indeed, the Ministry of Justice's website published the decree of law that requires the demonstration of a real link with the country. That is to say, apart from proving the lineage of the Sephardic root with a certified study, the possession of an inherited property or frequent trips to Portugal are required. The measure was approved by the Council of Ministers and promulgated in March by President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. Until before August 30, there was an avalanche of applications to bypass the new requirements.

Close to Putin

The outbreak of the war in Ukraine put Abramovich in the international spotlight, undoubtedly because he is one of the oligarchs with the most public profile, being the owner of Chelsea Football Club, one of the most prominent in the UK Premier League, and because of the eccentric luxuries that surround him. But above all because Western governments point him out for his close relationship with Vladimir Putin.

It did him little good to have even gone to the London courts to make clear a certain distance from the Kremlin, because the United States included him on a list (drawn up in 2018) in which it insists on that closeness. And his name also appears in a report prepared by the European Union (EU), which was the basis for imposing sanctions on the oligarchs.

On March 26, the EU made public the report to sanction 15 Russian oligarchs, in which it points out that "Abramovich, owner of Chelsea Football Club in London" (UK), has "long and close ties" and "privileged access" to Putin, with whom "he has maintained very good relations".

That connection, he adds, has helped Abramovich "maintain his considerable wealth." The EU lists him as a major shareholder in the Evraz steel group, one of Russia's largest taxpayers. To date, Western countries have sanctioned 96 oligarchs and 114 high-ranking Kremlin officials for such ties.

On top of all that, the British government froze the Russian billionaire's assets and forced him to put Chelsea for sale, under close government observation, as well as his real estate holdings. His British visa is frozen, although he also holds Israeli and Lithuanian nationalities.

In the past, the billionaire went through two trials in which he fought against accusations that brought him close to the figure of the Russian president. The first of them, a lengthy judicial process that began in 2011, in which another Russian oligarch, Boris Berezovsky, accused him of blackmailing and intimidating him to sell his shares in the oil company Sibneft at a "value substantially lower than the true value and he did it through threats", as alleged by the plaintiff's lawyer, Laurence Rabonowitz, reported a Reuters agency cable.

After falling out of favor for criticizing Putin, Berezovsky was pressured by his former disciple, to whom he ended up selling his stake in Sibneft pressured "by fears that, if he refused, Abramovich would ensure that Putin would intervene and the shares would be expropriated," the lawyer told the court.

The British court ruled in favor of Abramovich and Berezovsky failed in his attempt to receive compensation of 3.75 billion euros for alleged breach of trust, blackmail and breach of contract by his former disciple. In this legal battle, neither of the two contenders provided substantial evidence, relying instead on their testimonies, on the credibility of which the court relied in reaching its verdict, with the Chelsea owner coming out on top.

Abramovich also took to court journalist Catherine Belton who in 2020 published Putin's People, a volume in which it was claimed that the purchase of Chelsea in 2003 was Putin's decision to have a club that would sell a good image of Russia in the UK.

The oligarch always denied that extreme, considered that they were "false and defamatory" statements and thanks to his legal machinery he reached an agreement so that the publisher and the journalist included some of his explanations in the work.

Arrests

In March, the Portuguese Judicial Police confirmed in a statement the operation led by the National Unit for Combating Corruption on the guarantees to obtain nationality through the Sephardic route, which included searches in homes and offices of lawyers allegedly involved.

One of those arrested in this investigation was the rabbi of the Hebrew Community of Oporto, Daniel Litvak, who certified the alleged Sephardic lineage of the Russian oligarch to obtain Portuguese nationality, a fact which, since it became known, aroused criticism and suspicions.

The Portuguese government had granted exclusively to the Israeli Communities of Lisbon and Oporto the authority to certify the Sephardic ancestry of the applicants.

When the news became known, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalni was among those who accused Portugal of receiving bribes to naturalize the Russian oligarch, according to Euronews.

Litvak was arrested on March 10 as he was preparing to travel to Israel, reported Público. Two days later the rabbi was released after testifying about his alleged involvement in the irregularities and for allegedly profiting from the processing of Portuguese citizenship. The authorities imposed precautionary measures on him, including preventing him from leaving the country and he had to surrender his passport.

The approval of Abramovich's Portuguese citizenship, which lasted only six months, passed through his hands.

Investigators suspect that 335 million euros may have been diverted from donations received by the religious organization since the legislation came into force.

The second defendant is the lawyer Francisco Almeida Garrett, who belongs to the leadership of the Judaic Community of Porto and is the nephew of Maria de Belém Roseira, the Socialist deputy who defended the lax wording of the legislation for the Sephardim, reported the Spanish newspaper El País.

Abramovich was one of the main contributors to the Holocaust Museum in Porto, which opened to the public in April 2021, a month before the Russian billionaire visited the city to attend the UEFA final in the Dragon State, which Manchester City and Chelsea played at the end of May.

One of the curators of the Holocaust Museum is Hugo Miguel Vaz, who was in charge of entering information on Abramovich's Jewish background in Wikipedia, while his file was being processed before the Portuguese administration, according to Público.

Vaz edited the billionaire's profile 18 times in its English and Portuguese versions to include information about his Jewish grandparents.

The billionaire also heads and finances the Hebrew entity in his country that certified him as a Sephardi. Abramovich heads the board of directors of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia, chaired by Rabbi Alexander Boroda, who vouched for his Sephardic ancestry and was one of the keys to his naturalization as a Portuguese and European Union citizen.

Another Russian oligarch, Andrei Rappaport, whose fortune is estimated at close to 1.2 billion dollars, obtained from his time in banking and state-owned oil and energy companies after they were privatized, also obtained Portuguese nationality.

The Israeli multimillionaire Lev Leviev, known as The King of Diamonds, friend of Abramovich and of Berel Lazar, Russia's Chief Rabbi and close to Putin, was certified in 2020 by the Porto community, as documented by the Portuguese weekly Expresso.

Russian oligarch God Nisanov is awaiting Portuguese naturalization, Público newspaper identified. However, he was also one of the members of the economic elite sanctioned by the West.

Last June 2, when announcing a new round of sanctions, the United States included in them Nisanov, whom the head of the State Department, Antony Blinken, described as "a real estate investor and one of the richest men in Europe and a close collaborator of Russian officials". In 2014 he was honored in the Kremlin by Putin with the Order of Friendship.

Hours after the announcement, the World Jewish Congress announced that Nisanov had been removed from the leadership of the organization because of sanctions as a result of the war in Ukraine.

The aftermath

In March, when the inquiries began, the Portuguese Ministry of Justice had 86,500 requests for nationality in process and had granted more than 32,000. Most of them had gone through the Jewish community of Porto.

Lawyer Neyvi Tolentino explains in an interview that "this case of Mr. Abramovich coincided with an amendment to the Portuguese law and the requirements for requesting nationality through the Sephardic route were tightened. The reasons why those changes were made to the requirements to apply for nationality through the Sephardic route were never explained.

"But it happens that it is as a result of the fact that they make an inspection to all Russians, and this gentleman alleges that he is European and that he has the Portuguese passport by Sephardic descent, and that provoked the investigation to know the route of the authorization of that passport. In Portugal and abroad there is criticism because he could have incurred in illegal methods to obtain the nationality and the passport, that is why the investigation was initiated and the law was modified", he explains.

He adds that his office alone was handling, before August 30, between eight and 10 files a day from applicants who wanted to avoid the new, tougher requirements imposed by Portugal.

"Before it was not necessary to speak Portuguese, now they are demanding it. It has also been imposed to have real estate, business with a Portuguese company or a real link with the country, including frequent trips," explains the jurist, who clarifies that, unlike Spain, whose law did have a time limit, Portugal maintains in force the Sephardic Nationality Law of 2015.

"There are four requirements that did not exist before and that completely modify the entire law. From our office we made the presentation of the applications before August 30, without waiting for the approval of the Sephardic Jewish Federation, although we in all cases, without exception, did it with the genealogy study, to make sure that the applicant had Sephardic ancestry, and that allows us to then submit the full report, although the new restrictions have entered into force," he maintains.

Until before the entry into force of the amendment to the Portuguese law, he explains, Colombia, Mexico, Dominican Republic and Venezuela were still some of the countries where there were more applicants.

tobe excluded from the list of those called to the World Cup in Qatar

.In a press release, the Ecuadorian Soccer Federation considered that the CAS ruling is "arbitrary'' and "ignores the most elementary universally accepted legal principles''.

The nationality of Castillo, who was called up until last weekend, was challenged by Chile and Peru. They claimed that the player was Colombian, for which reason Ecuador should be sanctioned with the deduction of points in the matches played during the qualifying round.

World Cup.

This would have stripped Ecuador of the place it won in the World Cup and awarded it to the complainant countries.

CAS, the last instance to which the complaint was taken, issued its ruling on November 8. Although it determined that Castillo was eligible to play as an Ecuadorian, it stated that the defender was born in Colombia and that "false information'' about his date and place of birth was used to obtain an Ecuadorian passport.

Therefore, CAS decided that Ecuador should be deducted three points in the next qualifying round as a sanction. In addition, a fine of 100,000 euros was imposed.

CAS did not prohibit Castillo from playing in the World Cup. However, the Ecuadorian Federation stated that it had taken the decision to exclude him "at the risk of suffering unjust sanctions again''.

The former Brazil captain, who lifted the trophy in 1994 and 2002, also predicted a South American duel between Brazil and Argentina in the semifinals and that the France team will make it through to the final against Portugal

Portugal won 2-0 against Uruguay to secure qualification for the round of 16. They need a draw in the last match against Korea to secure first place in the group, which is not a minor issue because it avoids, in principle, a clash with Brazil. Even if they lose, they could still finish first. Bruno Fernandes scored a brace. The first goal looked like it was Cristiano Ronaldo's, but he did not touch the ball on his attempted header, although he did throw goalkeeper Rochet off his stride, and the ball slipped past him. The Manchester United midfielder scored again, on a very controversial penalty for handball by Gimenez in the last minute, and came close to a hat trick with a shot against the post in stoppage time.After the 1-0 Uruguay looked for the equalizer with everything, but Maxi Gomez hit the post. Luis Suarez also had a chance. The Uruguayan team is lacking goals. It has zero in two games. However, he has sent three balls to the woodwork. Anyway, they are not out yet.

They will play Ghana on the last matchday. If they win, they overtake the Africans and would have to wait to see what Korea does against Portugal. If the Asians win, the overall goal average would have to be taken into account to see who qualifies, as both would have 4 points.END OF THE MATCH.90+ minutes: Portugal, 2-Uruguay, 0. He had the hat trick in stoppage time.Minute 90+: Portugal, 2-Uruguay, 0. The match will go to 99, but it is decided in favor of Portugal.Minute 90+: Portugal, 2-Uruguay, 0. He takes a calm shot from eleven meters and scores a brace. Minute 90: Portugal, 1-Uruguay, 0. It's a handball by Giménez as he dives to the ground. It was the supporting hand, that's not a penalty, but the referee called it after being alerted on the VAR and seeing it on the monitor. Minute 90: Portugal, 1-Uruguay, 0. ATTENTION PENALTY FOR PORTUGAL. Minute 89: Portugal, 1-Uruguay, 0. Yellow to Ruben Dias for protesting. It is true that the players are very hot, but it is absurd because with two yellow cards in separate matches there is sanction.Minute 86: Portugal, 1-Uruguay, 0. Matias Vina for Mathias Olivera, last change of Uruguay.So has been the shot to the post of Maxi Gomez. The shot is wonderful.83rd minute: Portugal, 1-Uruguay, 0. Fernando Santos tries to stop the bleeding and takes Cristiano Ronaldo and Joao Félix off the field. Enter Gonçalo Ramos and Matheus Nunes.79th minute: Portugal, 1-Uruguay, 0. Arrascaeta loses in a one-on-one with Diogo Costa. Portugal has fallen and Uruguay is close to an equalizer. He has had three clear chances.78th minute: Portugal, 1-Uruguay, 0.

Yellow card to Joao Félix for a foul on Luis Suárez. He stepped on his foot.75th minute: Portugal, 1-Uruguay, 0. What speed to set up the shot after a combination with Pellestri, and the ball goes to the post. Portugal is saved by a miracle.72nd minute: Portugal, 1-Uruguay, 0. More changes in Uruguay, who now brings out all the artillery: Luis Suárez and Maxi Gómez enter the field and Cavani and Darwin Núñez leave. Change of strikers, to see if the luck changes as well. Cavani was surprised by the substitution and it seems that FIFA has finally given the goal to Bruno Fernandes. Minute 69: Portugal, 1-Uruguay, 0. Changes now in Portugal: Leao enters and Neves leaves. Fernando Santos' team wants the second and the video of how it was stoppedAnd here is the image of the spontaneous who jumped onto the pitch of Lusail Stadium.65th minute: Portugal, 1-Uruguay, 0.

It is not even clear if he touches the ball, but his jump throws the goalkeeper off his feet.54th minute: Portugal, 1-Uruguay, 0. Who else. Bruno Fernandes centers, CR sneaks in a fair, but legal position, and touches just enough with his head to send the ball into the net. Cristiano has no end. Minute 52: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. Joao Félix shoots into the side netting. It was a dangerous move. He found Bernando Silva and when the good ones get together the rival suffers.Minute 51: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. And now a spontaneous man jumps onto the field with a flag in favor of the LGTBI+ collectiveMinute 50: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. Hardly anything has been played in the second half due to a tackle by Vecino on Neves that had him lying on the field.Minute 46: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. Very intense first half. Portugal started dominating, although they lacked clarity in the arrivals, with too many side crosses and too many shots from outside the area. Uruguay defended comfortably and came to their senses in the last quarter of an hour, even having the best chance of the match. Minute 45: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. That's three minutes added on.Minute 44: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. Mathias Olivera gets another silly yellow.Minute 42: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. Raphael Guerreiro is replaced by Nuno Mendes.Minute 41: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. Nuno Mendes cannot continue, and leaves the field in tears.39th minute: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. Ruben Neves is yellow carded, first for Portugal.38th minute: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. He controls with his chest inside the area, there was no space and the defenders jumped on him to block the shot.

Maradonian play by Bentancur, who came out of his own half, got away from everyone, got in front of the goalkeeper, but couldn't beat the keeper. Here is the fight between friends Giménez and Joao Félix.23 minutes: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. Bruno Fernandes gives a scare for a divided ball with Darwin Núñez. The match was stopped, but the Manchester United midfielder has nothing serious. Minute 21: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. Portugal has definitely taken control of the match. It is not a harassment, Uruguay's defense is comfortable, but it may be a start.Minute 18: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. Cristiano Ronaldo looked for goal from a direct free kick, but the ball did not go high enough and crashed into the barrier.Minute 16: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. By the way, sparks flew a moment ago between Joao and Giménez. They are teammates at Atletico Madrid, but this is a World Cup match and there are no friends.12th minute: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. The Atletico center-back rose above everyone, but it went over.Minute 8: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. Another shot wide, this time by Bruno Fernandes. Minute 6: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. Yellow card for Bentancur. Absurd, in the opponent's half, going nowhere, he was late and hit Ruben Dias. Minute 4: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. It doesn't take long for Portugal to respond with a shot, also over the crossbar, by William Carvalho. Cristiano Ronaldo's shoulder save was exquisite.Minute 3: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. Mathias Olivera tried from distance, but it went high.Minute 1: Portugal, 0-Uruguay, 0. Portugal put the ball in play. The match is underway!THE MATCH BEGINSBut let's get back to what concerns us today. The anthems have already been played, and in a few minutes the ball will be rolling. Cristiano Ronaldo has already scored a goal in this World Cup. It was a penalty against Ghana. The Africans complained that it was whistled because the Portuguese is who he is. The FIFA Technical Study Group defined the play by assuring that CR had been "very intelligent". "A stroke of genius. He waited for the second just for the defender to touch him," they added. What do you think? This is the play:The warm-up for both teams is over. Everything is ready for the players to take the field and the match to begin.It is a match with scores to settle, because the last time they faced each other was at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, in the round of 16. Uruguay eliminated Portugal with a brace from Cavani (2-1). After that, the Charrúa met France, the eventual champions.Uruguay drew the first match and whatever happens today they will play it all out in a dog-eat-dog third matchday against Ghana. Portugal will get into the round of 16 if they win, as they would already have six points.For Uruguay this time Luis Suarez starts on the bench: Rochet, Varela, Gimenez, Godin, Coates, Olivera, Vecino, Bentancur, Fede Valverde, Cavani and Darwin Nunez.For Portugal: Diogo Costa, Joao Cancelo, Ruben Dias, Pepe, Nuno Mendes, Bernardo Silva, William Carvalho, Ruben Neves, Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Joao Felix.Good afternoon, welcome to the live broadcast of the match between Portugal and Uruguay, a match with many well-known Spanish soccer players in both teams: Joao Félix, William Carvalho, Cristiano Ronaldo, Pepe, Cancelo... on the Portuguese side, and Valverde, Godín Giménez, Darwin Núñez, Olivera, Cavani? on the Charrúa side.

Who is Mario Ferri, the Italian soccer player who took the field in Portugal-Uruguay: his help to Ukrainian refugees and intervention in Brazil 2014?

"Footballer and modern pirate". This is how Mario Ferri, the 35-year-old man who jumped onto the field at the beginning of the second half of the match that Portugal won against Uruguay at the Lusail stadium and made the Qatari authorities uncomfortable with his protest in the middle of the World Cup, defines himself in his social networks. After knocking down the security agent who tried to stop him with a dribble, he walked around the pitch with a flag of the LGBT community. And he wore a blue T-shirt with the Superman symbol and two slogans: "respect for Iranian women" and "save Ukraine".

It is not the first time that the Italian has made the news for this type of intervention, although it was perhaps the one that generated the most noise, especially because of the zeal exhibited by Qatar throughout the tournament to avoid any kind of manifestation of LGBT rights. For example, during the Brazil 2014 World Cup, it invaded the field in the round of 16 match between Belgium and the United States, wearing a similar T-shirt, but with the legend "save the children of Favela". He was then given three days to leave the country for disorderly conduct.

The peculiarity is that Ferri, in fact, is a soccer player. His last club was the Tre Fiori of San Marino in which, for example, he played a game in the UEFA Conference League. El Halcón, as he is nicknamed, does not limit his interventions to disturbing the authorities with his messages at soccer matches (he was also "suffered" in several duels of the European elite). He has also been directly involved in helping the causes he supports.

For example, when Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the player was playing for United Sports Club in Kolkata in India's Second Division. The competition had been put on hold by a resurgence of COVID-19 in the country. However, he dropped everything to dedicate himself to helping refugees move to Poland. To do so, he made his savings available. He slept nights and nights in his car to continue lending a hand and set a record of 10 nights without taking a shower.

This time he decided to make a nuisance of himself in Qatar. Once the images of his feint at security and his mad dash at the Lusail stadium went viral, many who thought they could identify him searched his Instagram account. There they noticed that, before and during the Group H match between the Lusitanians and Charrúas, he had shared content on his Instagram account. And they didn't hesitate. Ferri had done it again.

When many players (Germany's squad, for example) could not display an armband with the colors of the LGBT flag for fear of a FIFA sanction, another player took the flag and paraded it in front of the world's cameras. And on his body he wore two other highly topical slogans. After all, for Ferri, once again, his World Cup was in the message and not in his qualities with the ball.

Portugal won 2-0, advanced to the round of 16 and jeopardized Uruguay's place in the Qatar 2022 World Cup.

Was it Cristiano Ronaldo's goal against Uruguay? The striker's phrase that raised doubts and FIFA's verdict

The incredible penalty kick with which Portugal defined the match against Uruguay: the image of FIFA's express recommendation in this type of play.

Bolivian journalist who was detained by Qatari police officers who mistook his media logo for an LGBT flag speaks out

Ronaldo replacement is instant hit for Portugal

PORTUGAL Ramos 17, 51, 67 Pepe 33 Guerreiro 55, Leao 90+2 6

SWITZERLAND Akanji 58 1

BACK home he is known as O Feiticeiro, The Wizard. And last night Goncalo

Ramos performed one of the most incredible bits of sorcery ever seen at a World Cup: he made Cristiano Ronaldo disappear.

It is hard to imagine there has ever been a tournament debut quite like this one. Replacing the man some regard as the finest of all time, 21-year-old Ramos scored a hat-trick and made another for Raphael Guerreiro as Portugal won 6-1. The debate about whether this team is better or worse without Ronaldo is now over.

Removed from the line-up for his latest show of petulance in decline, there is no way back for him now. Not into the starting line-up, barring injury. He came on with 17 minutes remaining but the game was long won and he certainly has a role to play here, if engaged, but Portugal are better with a faster, younger man leading the line. That is the nature of elite sport.

One day, age will catch up with Ramos, too. But it will not be one day soon. It will be decades from now. For Ronaldo, however, that moment of truth has arrived. He is a man, not The Man, from here.

Even if Ramos had been content with his first goal, which broke the deadlock and put Portugal on course to meet Morocco in the quarter-finals, it would have vindicated coach Fernando Santos's call. But he didn't stop. He grabbed a second, a third, he got an assist.

It was a stunning introduction to Portugal's XI, having never been more than a substitute in vanishingly few appearances. Everything has changed now. This made a statement. This drew a line.

Going into this game, Ronaldo had played precisely 514 minutes of World Cup knockout football, for zero goals. His replacement took just 17 minutes to secure his first. It is pleasing for a manager when a plan comes together and, on the bench, Santos must have been grinning like a Cheshire cat.

Inside, obviously. It wouldn't do to exude too much glee given the potential for retribution. For all Santos knew, Piers Morgan could still be out here, and with a TV crew primed and ready to go.

Not that much of a case for reinstatement can be built. There may not be a bigger call made by any manager at this World Cup than the one that removed Ronaldo, but it was the right decision.

It was at the European Championship in 2004 the last time he was dropped in a meaningful match at a major tournament. Russia were the opponents in the second group game that day and Ronaldo was still a teenager. He came on in the second-half for Luis Figo.

Portugal had bigger stars than CR7, back then, mind. Figo was the No 7. Ronaldo was CR17. Leaving him out this time was huge by comparison.

Despite vox pops back home, many still thought when it came to it, Ronaldo would be an undroppable force. He spoke yesterday of his disappointment at Ronaldo's reaction to being taken off in the previous game he tried to claim his curses were aimed at an opponent, not Portugal's coaching staff and many shared his anger.

A reprimand and the ultimate sanction are very different, however. The news Ronaldo would not be starting still caused significant ripples. As did the name of his replacement. Ramos, a 21-year-old forward from Benfica, who was not even an international footballer a month ago. He made his debut on November 17 in a friendly against Nigeria scored one, made one but had never started for his country until last night.

Ramos has been prolific for his club this season with nine goals in 11 league games, but nervousness was only to be expected. Not just his first game, but with the most storied presence in the history of Portuguese football consigned to the margins on his behalf.

Yet there is something to be said for being 21 and centre stage. Sometimes you don't know enough to be scared.

Portugal got their first sight of goal after 17 minutes and, in a flash, Ramos had put the ball in the net. Joao Felix picked up a throw-in, slipped it through to Ramos. It was a crazily tight angle but, with the innocence and confidence of youth, Ramos took it on.

He also took on the reflexes of goalkeeper Yann Sommer and the stitching skills of whatever machine it is that makes the net. What a strike. Bang, gone, have that, 1-0. Sommer barely moved.

On the bench all cameras were trained on Ronaldo, but what was he going to do? Shout at the Swiss defence to be more organised next time? He ran down the touchline to celebrate with his usurper, same as the rest of the Portugal team.

We say he makes it all about him but, let's face it, the media do, too. Before the game, the crowd of cameramen gathered in front of the dug-out was astonishing, all with their lenses pointed away from the team on the pitch towards one figure on the bench. It was such a huge crowd Harry and Meghan will probably use it in their next Netflix documentary and claim it was about them.

Ramos got away in the 23rd minute, too, but elected to shoot rather than play in a better placed team-mate. Fortunately for

Portugal they boast experience too, in the form of Pepe, 40 next birthday who took Ronaldo's captain's armband in his absence. When he claimed goal No 2, he became the secondoldest scorer in World Cup history, after 42-year-old Roger Miller of Cameroon. It was a cracking header, meeting a Bruno Fernandes corner.

Ronaldo seemed to like that one even more. And he smiled broadly midway through the second-half when the crowd sang his name, imploring Santos to bring him on. By that time, however, all but the most besotted members of his fan club were talking about the new wiz in town.

After the break Ramos and Portugal took off. In the 51st minute, Diogo Dalot crossed from the right and Ramos got in front of Eray Comert to poke the ball through the legs of Sommer.

What a goal the fourth one was. Joao Felix and Otavio brought Ramos into play and he slid a pass to Raphael whose finish left Sommer no chance.

At that point Switzerland scored and Ramos even contrived involvement in that too, the ball coming off his head before Akanji volleyed in at the far post.

No matter. It was soon forgotten when the young man nailed his hat-trick. Joao Felix played the pass but Ramos finished with a Messi-style or should it be Saka-style dink over Sommer. He was off soon after, having completed arguably the most memorable World Cup hat-trick since 1966.

Rafael Leao curled one past Sommer in injury time for the sixth while Ronaldo came on and had a goal disallowed. Consider that baton passed. PORTUGAL (4-3-3): Costa 6; Dalot 6.5, Pepe 7, Dias 7, Guerreiro 7.5; Otavio 7 (Vitinha 74min, 6), Carvalho 7, Silva 7.5 (Neves 81); Fernandes 7 (Leao 87), RAMOS 9 (Horta 74, 6), Joao Felix 8.5 (Ronaldo 73, 6). Scorers: Ramos 17, 51, 67, Pepe 33, Guerreiro 55, Leao 90+2. Booked: None. Manager: Fernando Santos 8.5.

SWITZERLAND (3-5-2): Sommer 5; Akanji 5, Schar 4.5 (Comert 46, 5), Rodriguez 5; Fernandes 5, Sow 5 (Seferovic 54, 5), Xhaka 5, Freuler 5 (Zakaria 54, 4.5), Vargas 5 (Okafor 66, 4.5); Embolo 5 (Jashari 89), Shaqiri 5. Scorer: Akanji 58.

Booked: Schar, Comert. Manager: Murat Yakin 5. Referee: Cesar Arturo Ramos (Mexico) 6. Attendance: 83,720.

* Cristiano Ronaldo dropped by Portugal at major tournament for meaningful game for first time since 2004

* But his replacement Goncalo Ramos netted the first 2022 World Cup hat-trick in a stunning performance

* Pepe, Raphael Guerreiro and Rafael Leao were also on target in 6-1 thrashing of Switzerland in Lusail

* Manuel Akanji grabbed a consolation for Switzerland who faded badly after bright opening 10 minutes

* Ronaldo eventually came on as a second half substitute and had a goal ruled out for offside

* Portugal have now set up a quarter-final with Morocco and will target a semi-final with England or France

Back home he is known as O Feiticeiro, The Wizard. And on Tuesday night Goncalo Ramos performed one of the most incredible bits of sorcery ever seen at a World Cup: he made Cristiano Ronaldo disappear.

Going into this game, Ronaldo had played precisely 514 minutes of World Cup knockout football, for zero goals.

His replacement, took just 17 minutes to secure his first. It is pleasing for a manager when a plan comes together and, on the bench, Santos must have been grinning like a Cheshire cat.

Not that much of a case for reinstatement can be built. There may not be a bigger call made by any manager at this World Cup than the one that removed Ronaldo, but it was inarguably the right decision.

It was at the European Championships in 2004 the last time he was dropped in a meaningful match at a major tournament – so not a dead rubber. Russia were the opponents in the second group game that day and Ronaldo was still a teenager.

He came on in the second-half for Luis Figo. Portugal had bigger stars than CR7, back then, mind. Figo was the No 7. Ronaldo was CR17.

Leaving him out this time was huge by comparison. Despite vox pops back home, many still thought when it came to it, Ronaldo would be an undroppable force and Santos would flinch. He spoke on Tuesday of his disappointment in Ronaldo’s reaction to being left out in the last game – the player tried to claim his curses were aimed at an opponent, not Portugal’s coaching staff – and many shared his anger.

A reprimand and the ultimate sanction are very different, however. The news that Ronaldo would not be starting still caused significant ripples pre-match.

As did the name of his replacement. Ramos, a 21-year-old forward from Benfica, who was not even an international footballer a month ago. He made his debut on November 17 in a friendly against Nigeria – scored one, made one, not a bad beginning – but had never started for his country until on Tuesday night.

He also took on the reflexes of goalkeeper Yann Sommer and the stitching skills of whatever machine it is that makes the net. What a strike. Bang, gone, have that, 1-0. Sommer barely moved. It was like the old quickest draw in the west joke. Want to see it again?

On the bench all cameras were trained on Ronaldo, but what was he going to do? Shout at the Swiss defence to be more organised next time? He ran down the touchline to celebrate with his usurper same as the rest of the Portuguese team. We say he makes it all about him but, let’s face it, the media do, too.

It was such a huge crowd that Harry and Meghan will probably use it in their next Netflix documentary and claim it was about them.

Ramos got away in the 23rd minute, too, but elected to shoot rather than play in a better placed team-mate, so raw enthusiasm isn’t always an advantage.

Fortunately for Portugal they boast experience too, in the form of Pepe, 40 next birthday - who took Ronaldo’s captain’s armband in his absence. When he claimed goal number two, he became the second oldest scorer in World Cup history, after 42-year-old Roger Milla of Cameroon.

It was a cracking header, meeting a corner from Bruno Fernandes and getting in between Switzerland’s Fabian Schar and Manuel Akanji. Ronaldo seemed to like that one even more.

And he smiled broadly when midway through the second-half the crowd at the Lusail Stadium sang his name, imploring Santos to bring him on.

By that time, however, all but the most besotted members of his fan club were talking about the new wiz in town.

In charge by half-time, after the break Ramos and Portugal took off. In the 51st minute, Diogo Dalot – who, incredibly, keeps Joao Cancelo out of this side – crossed from the right and Ramos got in front of Eray Comert at the near post to poke the ball through the legs of the outmatched Sommer.

What a goal the fourth one was. An exchange of passes between Joao Felix and Otavio brought Ramos into play and he slid a lovely pass to Raphael whose finish left Sommer no chance.

At that point Switzerland scored and Ramos even contrived involvement in that too, the ball coming off his head trying to clear a corner, before Akanji volleyed in at the far post.

No matter. It was soon forgotten when the young man went to the other end and nailed his hat-trick. Joao Felix played the pass but Ramos finished with a Messi-style – or should it be Saka-style – dink over Sommer.

He was off soon after, having completed arguably the most memorable World Cup hat-trick since 1966.

Lionel Messi and Argentina are hoping to win the World Cup in Qatar this winter ahead of Tuesday's World Cup clash with Croatia.

As Lionel Messi and Argentina dazzle at the World Cup, some conspiracy theories have been put forward by players on the Portugal national team. Namely Bruno Fernandes and Pepe, who both believe the authorities want the South American giants to go all the way in Qatar this winter. Lionel Scaloni’s side will lock horns with Croatia in the semi-finals of the tournament on Tuesday night, where they’ll be hoping to continue their charge towards football’s ultimate prize.

Argentina were written off by many after losing their World Cup opener to Saudi Arabia.

However, since then, they’ve bounced back by beating the likes of Mexico, Poland, Australia and the Netherlands to make the last four of the competition.

Messi has been typically mesmeric, with the 35-year-old scoring four goals and clocking up two assists from five appearances so far.

But, amid Argentine’s resurgence, Portuguese players have started to voice concerns over the tournament being fixed - despite there being no evidence to suggest this.

Portugal were sent crashing out of the tournament by Morocco on Saturday, in a result nobody saw coming.

And Pepe, speaking afterwards, cited concerns that FIFA’s decision to appoint an Argentinean referee was a deliberate ploy to help Messi and his team-mates win the competition.

"It’s unacceptable for an Argentine referee to referee our game,” ranted the 39-year-old.

"After what happened yesterday, with Messi talking, all of Argentina was talking and the referee comes here to blow the whistle.

“I’m not saying that he comes here conditioned...but what did we play the second half? We weren’t allowed to play the second half.

"I can bet that Argentina will be champions.”

And Bruno Fernandes, never one to shy away from voicing his opinion, said: "We already know how it works €¦ before the game we already knew what we were in for, and what kind of referee we would find.

"I don’t know if they’re going to give the trophy to Argentina. I don’t care, I’m going to say what I think and screw them.

“It’s very weird that a ref officiates us from a country still in the competition... clearly, they’ve tilted the field against us.

"Unfortunately, in these competitions, where there are no Portuguese referees, there are referees from teams that are still in the competition."

Portugal were poor in their World Cup clash with Morocco.

But they were clearly irked by some of the decision-making that went on during the showdown, despite looking flat throughout the match.

Messi, meanwhile, cut an angry figure after Argentina battled their way past the Netherlands on Friday night - telling Louis van Gaal to silence himself in a bold interview.

“I feel disrespected by Van Gaal after his pregame comments and some Dutch players spoke too much during the game,” he said.

“I heard Van Gaal saying that in a penalty shoot-out they had the advantage, or if we went to penalties then they would win – I think he needs to keep his mouth shut.”

And when asked about the refereeing at the tournament, he said: “I don’t want to talk about the referee because they sanction you for being honest.

“I think people saw what it was. FIFA cannot use this kind of referee for this type of match.”

Argentina last locked horns with Croatia at the World Cup in Russia four years ago.

They lost 3-0 to Tuesday’s opponents, with Ante Rebic, Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic all on target.

NAUSĖDA SHARES DOCUMENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN RESPONSE TO QUERIES OVER KGB FILE

 

Vilnius, April 13 (ELTA) – President Gitanas Nausėda has reiterated that he never communicated with the KGB and shared photocopies of a document from the Lithuanian Special Archives on his Facebook on Thursday in response to an inquiry from public activist Andrius Tapinas claiming he had found Nausėda's KGB file in the archives.

Tapinas, founder of Laisvės TV, says that Nausėda’s file is most likely related to his internship in Germany.

Nausėda said in a post on social media that he would respond to the new questions as he had nothing to hide.

"I studied in Germany, University of Mannheim, in 1990-1992. As regards the internship, I communicated only with the Lithuanian education ministry’s staff and representatives of the University of Mannheim. I had never talked to KGB officers neither about the internship in Germany nor any other issues,” the president stated.

Nausėda also said that the file "becoming a basis for new insinuations” was available in the archives to everyone. It includes two sheets of a form dated 15 January 1990 marked with seals of institutions approving his studies in Germany.

"The form was filled in without me being present – the Ministry of Education sent the request, which is what it says on the sheet. Anyone can go and check it. If you don't want to bother, I put the sheets here. Read them, study them. Once again, I have nothing to hide,” the president said.

Nausėda reiterated that he made a mistake by entering the Communist party and not disclosing the fact as he ran for president in 2019.

According to him, "a young man’s decision” had no impact on his worldview, aspirations and political decisions.

"When I decided to go into politics, I was well aware that I would be under a magnifying glass. Some will do it because the public has a right to know, others to satisfy their curiosity, others for political gain,” he wrote on Facebook.

 

BALTIC–BLACK SEA COUNTRIES DISCUSS MILITARY COOPERATION AT CRIMEA PLATFORM CONFERENCE

 

Vilnius, April 13 (ELTA) – National Defence Minister Arvydas Anušauskas is conducting a visit to Bucharest, capital of Romania, on April 12-13, to attend the Black Sea Security Conference of the International Crimea Platform where he has underscored the importance of military cooperation in the Baltic-Black Sea region in the face of the threat posed by Russia, the ministry reports.  

The Crimea Platform is a diplomatic format of Ukraine aimed at drawing the attention of international community to the illegal annexation of Crimea carried out by Russia in 2014. The platform pulls together participants from 46 countries: Defence and Foreign Affairs Ministers, NATO and EU experts, NCOs and regional organisations. The summit in Bucharest has addressed major implications of the Russian war in Ukraine to the Back Sea region and the world. 

"This conference is absolutely relevant because even when the war ends, the Russian threat will remain. It does not matter if we are the Black Sea or the Baltic Sea region. Russia continues using military, political and economic leverage in what it sees as its sphere of influence, therefore we have to ensure the succession of an undivided and steady assistance to Ukraine through political and practical channels alike, as a sign of a European solidarity that Putin will never be able to disrupt,” says Anušauskas.

The current security situation in the Black Sea and the Sea o Azov regions was reviewed and possible solutions to the Russian blockade in the Black Sea was also discussed in Bucharest. 

On 12 April, Anušauskas met with Minister of National Defence of Romania Angel Tîlvăr. The ministers discussed bilateral cooperation, the importance of continued support to Ukraine, preparation for the upcoming NATO Summit in Vilnius in July, and exchanged assessments of the security situation in the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea regions.

Anušauskas thanked Tîlvăr for the Romanian rotation of the NATO Air Policing Mission in the Baltic States.

 

COMMANDER OF FIELD ARMY OF GERMANY VISITS GERMAN TROOPS IN LITHUANIA

 

Vilnius, April 14 (ELTA) – On 13 April, Commander of the Field Army of Germany Maj Gen Harald Gante began his visit in Lithuania – meeting with Chief of Defence Lt Gen Valdemaras Rupšys, Land Force Commander Brig Gen Artūras Radvilas, visiting German troops deployed in Lithuania, reports the Armed Forces.

The main focus of the general’s visit is to discuss collective defence, national defence plans and integration of the German military capabilities with them. Other items on the visit agenda are support in Lithuania’s military capability development and joint training.

"Germany is one of our key Allies in security and defence, therefore, implementation of the adopted decisions requires a consistent interaction and coordination. Our militaries maintain the dialogue, address issues and train daily across all levels. Maj Gen Gante and I have discussed collective defence, we aim for a timely interoperability and action coordination in delivering on both, deterrence and defence. The key points of our discussions are joint exercises, activity of the NATO enhanced Forward Presence Battalion Battle Group, force deployment and support to our capability development efforts,” said the chief of defence of Lithuania after the meeting.

At Rukla, the commander of the Field Army of Germany met with troops of the permanently deployed German Army's 41st Mechanised Infantry Brigade’s Forward Command Element and the NATO enhanced Forward Presence Battalion Battle Group. On Friday, Maj Gen Gante will meet with Chief of the Defence Staff Maj Gen Mindaugas Steponavičius.

 

TEN MIGRANTS WERE STOPPED FROM ILLEGALLY ACCESSING LITHUANIA VIA BELARUS

 

Vilnius, April 14 (ELTA) – On Thursday, 13 April, Lithuanian border guards stopped 10 migrants from crossing the state border illegally from Belarus.

Meanwhile, 41 migrants unsuccessfully attempted to cross from Belarus to Latvia on Thursday and 91 tried to enter Poland from Belarus on Wednesday.

So far in 2023, by 14 April, the State Border Guard Service (VSAT) has prevented 785 migrants from accessing Lithuania illegally via Belarus. The figure stood at 11,211 in 2022 and at 8,120 in 2021, since 3 August, when the VSAT was authorised to start turning around illegal migrants, until the end of the year.

Since the start of the migrant crisis caused by Belarus, Lithuanian border guards have thwarted 20,102 illegal border crossing attempts.

 

FINANCE MINISTER MET WITH DEPUTY SECRETARY OF US TREASURY

 

Vilnius, April 14 (ELTA) – Minister of Finance Gintarė Skaistė is paying a visit to Washington DC to attend spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). On 13 April, the minister also met with deputy secretary of the US Treasury, Wally Adeyemo, and underlined the need to expand sanctions both on Russia and Belarus, as well as to prevent sanction circumvention.

"Together with Western partners we must continue tightening sanctions on aggressors Russia and Belarus, and to take care about their effective enforcement in practice. In this regard, it is crucial to prevent channels for sanction evasion via third countries by taking advantage of financial and economic leverage. When expanding sanctions we must focus on decisions reducing Russia’s budget revenue and limiting opportunities for it to finance the war against Ukraine,” said Skaistė.

At the meeting, the minister also emphasised the need to muster sufficient support for rebuilding Ukraine and to find a way to use Russia’s frozen assets. She stressed that attracting financial aid remains a challenge taking into account the USD 411 billion damage Russia’s war has caused in Ukraine. The minister noted that taking into consideration Ukraine’s needs of USD 14 billion funding for rebuilding critical energy infrastructure this year, as well as considering long-term rebuilding efforts, the aggressor must pay and Russia’s frozen assets must be used to cover the costs. It is estimated that Russia’s frozen assets total USD 300 billion, while USD 50 billion of assets of sanctioned companies and individuals are in central bank reserves.

Deputy Secretary Adeyemo serves as the Treasury Department’s number two official and chief operating officer. He has taken a leading role in Treasury’s national security, economic inequality, and pandemic-related economic recovery work.

 

EXPORTING REGION IS OUR GOAL IN COOPERATION WITH LATVIA, ENERGY MIN SAYS

 

Vilnius, April 13 (ELTA) – On Thursday, Energy Minister Dainius Kreivys had a meeting with Latvian Minister for Climate and Energy Raimonds Čudars in Vilnius.

The ministers discussed the implementation of the synchronisation project, opportunities for the joint development of renewable energy, solidarity in ensuring security of gas supply and other issues.

"I told the minister that Lithuania’s position on the Baltic Sea coast is unique, because we have a large electricity potential and consumption potential, and we have an industry that needs to decarbonise. And for that we will need a lot of hydrogen, so we are planning to build not only offshore parks, but also an energy island in the Baltic Sea. It could include not only Lithuanian parks, but also Latvian parks,” Kreivys told reporters after the bilateral meeting with his Latvian counterpart.

"We discussed that the northern region will be, according to all studies, the region that will export energy to Central Europe. For that, joint action is needed to develop projects such as offshore parks, an energy island, so that the hydrogen corridor and our energy economy can move forward,” he added.

The minister also said that Lithuanian and Latvian cement companies, assisted by ministries, would seek to implement a European Union-funded project for CO2 capture and disposal.

Kreivys said that the ministers also agreed on blocking imports of Russian liquefied petroleum gas in the Baltic States. It would be a decision of the Baltic States, as there are no European-level sanctions in this case, he noted.

Latvian Minister for Climate and Energy Raimonds Čudars thanked Lithuania for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Klaipėda terminal to Latvia in 2022. The unity in times of uncertainty cannot be overestimated, he stressed.

"The Baltic States, Lithuania and Latvia, set certain example of very positive results achieved by working together. Further cooperation among the Baltic States can result in a sustainable and resilient energy sector that would be beneficial for their citizens, economies and businesses,” Čudars said.

Kreivys and Čudars were also scheduled Thursday to visit the energy storage system at the Vilnius Battery Park. On Friday, the Latvian delegation will tour the Kruonis hydroelectric power plant.

 

FURTHER DECISIONS ON QUITTING BRELL AFTER FEASIBILITY STUDY – KREIVYS

 

Vilnius, April 13 (ELTA) – Energy Minister Dainius Kreivys says that further decisions on energy synchronisation with continental European grids and withdrawal from the BRELL electricity grid system will be made after the results of the technical feasibility study.

He also said that the data from the study would enable discussions on a joint test of isolated operation of the Baltic system.

"This is Lithuania’s test and there has been no decision by Latvia or Estonia not to participate. Our proposal was to do a joint test sometime this year, but for now we are doing it ourselves. As for the future, we plan to have the results of the studies already in May on the technical feasibility: adequacy, stability of the network, changes in prices that may be associated with faster synchronisation,” Kreivys told reporters after his meeting with Latvian Minister for Climate and Energy Raimonds Čudars on Thursday.

"I hope that after this step, when Latvia and Estonia will also see the results of the study, it will be possible to start talking about a joint test of the isolated operation of the electricity system,” he said.

According to Kreivys, the study’s results will help the Baltic countries to decide whether to exict the BRELL agreement. He says he is convinced that such a decision should be taken only together.

The Latvian minister said that his country’s possible participation in a joint Baltic isolated test would depend on the results of the Lithuanian test and also on the readiness of the Latvian system.

Latvia will help ensure that the test on 22 April goes smoothly, Čudars said.

The Baltic States have agreed to disconnect from the post-Soviet BRELL ring, which also includes Russia and Belarus, and to synchronise their electricity grids with Western Europe by the end of 2025.

 

WE WILL DO OUR UTMOST TO BAR RUSSIAN, BELARUSIAN ATHLETES FROM OLYMPICS, MINISTER SAYS

 

Vilnius, April 13 (ELTA) – On Thursday, Baltic and Polish sport ministers held a remote meeting to discuss further steps together and individually to prevent Russian and Belarusian from competing at international events.

"The efforts to bring Russian and Belarusian athletes back into competition under the guise of neutrality only reinforces the propaganda of these countries and allows them to continue to spread the lie that not everyone sees Russia or Belarus as the aggressors,” Jurgita Šiugždinienė, Lithuanian Minister of Education, Science and Sport, said.

"We do not accept this, and we are and will continue to do our utmost to ensure that the international federations do not allow these countries to participate in the Olympic qualifiers. It is very important to us that our athletes take part in the Olympic qualifiers without having to compete against the representatives of the aggressors,” she stressed.

According to the ministry, Lithuania was supported in the meeting in its call to invite sports federations to sign joint declarations opposing the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in international competitions. Such statements would be sent to both the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and other international federations. Lithuania and Poland have already signed such declarations.

The ministers and sport officials also discussed the possibility of appealing to international business organisations having offices in Russia and Belarus, asking them not to sponsor international competitions involving representatives of the aggressors.

The Estonian official suggested contacting broadcasters of the Olympic Games. Lithuania proposed to approach France at governmental level and request banning Russian and Belarusian athletes from the Paris Olympics.

It was agreed in the meeting that the participating countries will organise a joint discussion next week, after familiarising themselves with the fourth statement on Russia’s war against Ukraine and international sport proposed by the United Kingdom.

As earlier reported, in February this year, sport ministers and officials from 35 countries signed a joint statement calling on the IOC to prevent Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing again as Russia continues its war in Ukraine.

 

EIF, NOVITI FINANCE AGREE TO LEND UP TO EUR 47MN FOR MICRO-BUSINESSES

 

Vilnius, April 13 (ELTA) – The European Investment Fund (EIF) and Noviti Finance, Lithuania’s alternative non-bank business financier, have signed a portfolio guarantee agreement under which almost EUR 47 million will be lent on preferential terms to micro-businesses in Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland, the EIF said in a press release.

The EIF guarantee benefiting the microfinance business is provided under the European Union’s InvestEU programme. It is expected that around 2,640 microloans will be signed under this programme and micro-enterprises with up to ten employees and annual revenues of up to EUR 2 million will be able to borrow up to EUR 50,000.

Businesses will not be asked to pledge any assets, and, in some cases, loans will even be granted without any collateral. Loans will be granted for both investment and working capital purposes.

"This new agreement with Noviti Finance, backed by the InvestEU programme, will support micro-businesses that struggle with traditional lending and are faced with different financial pressures today. We are especially proud that besides going to Lithuania and Latvia, part of the lending will be channelled to the Polish market which is currently underserved in terms of financing to small businesses and micro-enterprises,” EIF Chief Executive Marjut Falkstedt said.

CEO of Noviti Finance Linas Armalys welcomed the fact that the new guarantee will open up the possibility for even more companies to obtain finance on more favourable terms. "Micro-enterprises with up to ten employees account for 84% of all small businesses operating in Lithuania. However, they are the ones that have most difficulty accessing finance. Small businesses have much smaller needs and often have no tangible assets to pledge. The situation is similar in neighbouring countries such as Latvia and Poland. In all three countries, this programme will make a significant contribution to the availability of finance for small businesses.” 

European Commission Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People Valdis Dombrovskis said: "InvestEU plays a crucial role in helping small EU businesses get the financing they need to grow, innovate and create jobs. Thanks to today’s new InvestEU agreement, micro-businesses in Lithuania, Latvia and Poland will benefit from loans that are tailored to their needs. This will enable them to overcome the obstacles they face in accessing finance so that they can reach their full potential.”

The importance of the latest agreement with the EIF is confirmed by the results of Noviti Finance over the last few years. Under two previous agreements with the EIF, Noviti Finance disbursed loans to micro-enterprises in a much shorter timeframe than anticipated. The first EIF guarantee of EUR 10 million in 2020 was deployed within 16 months. Last year’s guarantee of EUR 12.5 million in loans was disbursed even faster — within a year. As many as 1,305 companies received concessional finance under this agreement.

"The last few years have been difficult for business, but it is encouraging that companies are adapting quickly to the changing environment and are actively applying to us for financing,” adds Armalys.

At the beginning of 2023, Noviti Finance also started providing business loans in Poland, where it plans to finance more than 200 small businesses and distribute EUR 3 million in loans this year.

The company estimates that in Lithuania last year, small and medium-sized businesses borrowed, on average, for 27 months and the average loan amount issued was around EUR 16,000. In Lithuania, 75% of all loans granted by Noviti Finance were guaranteed by the EIF. In Latvia, the percentage was even higher at 91%.

Noviti Finance has been operating on the market since 2016. The company has financed more than 3,500 companies in the Baltic States, where Noviti Finance actively contributes to the promotion of small businesses.

In Lithuania, Noviti Finance is an official partner of Invega and also lends to small businesses through the EIF’s InvestEU programme. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Noviti Finance actively implemented state support measures for businesses and was the second largest financier in terms of "Loans to businesses most affected by COVID-19”.

ESTONIAN EMPLOYERS SAY GOVERNMENT GAVE THEM AN ULTIMATUM OVER MINIMUM WAGE

 

Tallinn, April 13 (ELTA) –Arto Aas, executive manager of the Estonian Employers Confederation, told the public broadcaster ERR that the government should not meddle in hiking the minimum wage if it wants to respect European practice, and that employers were told to get it done or the new coalition would do it for them.

Aas told the Uudis+ radio show that the minimum wage in Estonia has been hiked by 11-12 percent annually in cooperation between employers and unions, which has exceeded forecasts of around 8 percent.

While Estonia has around 650,000 workers, only tens of thousands make the minimum wage.

"It is not much. However, minimum wage hikes also affect other lower end salaries. Its effect on salaries and growth is considerable, while certain state expenses, benefits and services are also tied to the minimum wage. So, the effects go beyond a few tens of thousands of people,” Aas said.

 

ESTONIA’S BORDER STABLE BUT BELARUSIAN MIGRATION ATTACK NOT OVER – BORDER GUARDS

 

Tallinn, April 13 (ELTA) – Border guards from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland met on the island of Saaremaa on Thursday to discuss cooperation, threats and possible incidents on Belarus and Russia’s borders, Estonia’s public broadcaster ERR reports.

Head of Estonia’s Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) Egert Belitšev said the situation on the Estonian border is stable but said it must be taken into account that Russia is waging an active war.

"It is important to remember that this migration attack is not over. There are still people on the borders of Poland, Lithuania and Latvia who are trying to get in and who have been organized and targeted by the Belarusian authorities,” Belitšev said.

He highlighted that these migration routes are not spontaneous and are organized by Belarus.

 

LATVIAN PRESIDENT GRANTED STATUS OF AN HONORARY CITIZEN OF LISBON

 

Riga, April 13 (ELTA) – Latvian President Egils Levits Thursday met with Mayor of Lisbon Carlos Moedas as part of his state visit to Portugal, highlighting the role of Lisbon in organising various European and international events, the presidency reports.

Levits expressed Latvia’s interest in cooperation in transport, IT and other areas, also noting the mayor’s previous work experience as Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science at the European Commission. The President of Latvia appreciated the contribution of Lisbon, as a sister city of Kyiv, by hosting Ukrainian refugees and providing support to Kyiv.

Moedas referred to the visit of the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, to Lisbon last week, during which he had heard many complimentary words about the great support of the society and the president of Latvia for Ukraine. Moedas underlined the historic spirit of resistance and freedom of the Latvian people, which is also reflected in the Constitution.

The mayor of Lisbon highly appreciated the president’s support for multilateralism, democracy and international law, awarding Levits the status of honorary citizen of Lisbon. The president of Latvia thanked Moedas for the honour he had received and for Portugal’s hospitality during the state visit.

 

LATVIAN RAILWAYS ALREADY IN TALKS WITH GRAIN FARMING COMPANIES, AHEAD OF HARVEST SEASON

 

Riga, April 13 (ELTA) – Members of SJSC Latvijas dzelzceļš (Latvian Railways, LDz) Board have met with the management of Latvian grain farmers’ cooperative VAKS to discuss further cooperation so that this year’s grain crops are also shipped to their destinations by rail as quickly as possible, without compromising grain quality, the Latvian Railways said.

VAKS cooperative society’s Board Chairman Indulis Jansons said that he had a high opinion of cooperation with LDz subsidiaries LDZ CARGO Ltd. and LDZ Loģistika Ltd. in grain transportation: "VAKS has been a customer of LDz Group for a long time, and members of the cooperative are planning to use railways for transportation of their freights more actively in the future because this is a sustainable, reliable and environmentally friendly way of transporting goods.”

During the meeting, LDz Chairman of the Board Rinalds Pļavnieks said: "In terms of volume, grain products make up the largest part of our domestic cargo transportation volumes, and each year we transport significant and even record-breaking amounts of crops. However, these freights are highly seasonal, so a large number of wagons must be available for transportation in a short period of time. LDz subsidiaries have a high capacity and their ability to provide these transport services in very tense circumstances meets grain farmers’ needs. At the same time, it is essential that all the involved parties cooperate, therefore we appreciate that grain farmers who want to ship freights by rail plan their requirements in good time, discuss them with us, so that the number of wagons our customers need is available for this purpose in the busiest time of the season.”

Companies of LDz Group provide logistics services tailored for customers’ needs, they have established long-time cooperation with representatives of the industry, who will in the near future receive an inquiry from LDz asking them to indicate the provisional number of wagons needed for transportation of their products this season, so that LDz could provide uninterrupted transportation services.

The number of wagons used for grain transportation varies from year to year, depending on both the harvest in the given year and the projected grain transportation volumes. Wagon shortages can, for example, be caused by situations where grain wagons are actually used as grain "storage facilities”, when produce is stored in wagons for a disproportionately long time. Therefore LDz advises its customers to carefully plan further grain logistics so that LDz could ensure continuous transportation and guarantee the delivery of grain to a destination without a hitch.

Did this pop banger just trigger an armed coup? The wild revolutionary politics of Eurovision

It’s not just about the baking grannies and rapping astronauts … the world’s favourite song contest has also got real clout, getting gay marriage legalised and bringing down fascist regimes

At 10.55pm on 24 April 1974, Portuguese radio played their entry to that year’s Eurovision song contest – and soldiers took to the streets. The tune by Paulo de Carvalho was the pre-agreed signal to start an armed coup, and for rifle-toting military to rise up against a fascist dictatorship. Citizens flocked to join in and there was so little resistance that flowers were placed in unfired gun barrels (it became known as the Carnation Revolution[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/29/the-carnation-revolution-5-may-1974] ). It started Portugal’s transformation into a democracy and is surely the only revolution triggered by a crooner with a very large collar[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWhxZ0JB9j4].

If you focus entirely on the performances, Eurovision is a bit daft. OK, very daft. According to the results, in 2018 the continent’s finest piece of music featured a woman squawking like a chicken[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84LBjXaeKk4] and in 2006 nothing said “credible winner” like five pogoing orcs singing[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAh9NRGNhUU] about the “a-rock-alypse”. There are rapping astronauts[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR9rtB2ilZU], competitors who perform as half-animal/half-fruit[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJjo8s3fKUM] and multitasking grannies[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgUstrmJzyc&embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fvirginradio.co.uk%2F&source_ve_path=Mjg2NjY&feature=emb_logo] baking bread to Euro-rave.

But Eurovision is also a deeply serious political affair. Time and again, countries (including brutal dictatorships) have used it as an astonishingly effective form of political power – and reinvented themselves in the eyes of the world.

“Even from the very first contest you see politics being played out,” says Dean Vuletic, who created the world’s first university course on Eurovision. “In 1956, the first West German entry was sung by a Jewish Holocaust survivor – a clear attempt to distance themselves from their Nazi past. On day one it’s being used by a country to change their identity on the international stage.”

Ever since, Eurovision has been intrinsically intertwined with international diplomacy. In 1964, Portugal and Spain’s participation – despite being dictatorships – saw protests break out mid-contest, with a banner-toting activist having to be dragged off the stage. In 1969, General Franco’s attempt to use his country’s hosting of Eurovision to (in Vuletic’s words) “whitewash his regime” saw him recruit surrealist art megastar Salvador Dalí to design the publicity materials (ie a bizarre poster[https://www.etsy.com/listing/1375929939/1969-eurovision-lithographic-poster-by] with mutant planet-sized lips and a squadron of terrifying, armless monsters). After Turkey invaded Cyprus, Greece hit back via Eurovision, using their 1976 entry to make claims about napalm and mass graves – leading Turkey to boycott the contest. And Portugal’s entry didn’t just set the nation on the road to democracy – it allowed several African countries to become independent, after the Portuguese military withdrew from its overseas territories.

Sometimes, however, Eurovision has been caught up in a clampdown on freedom of expression. In 2009, the Azerbaijani government interrogated 43 people[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/18/azerbaijan-authorities-interrogate-music-fans] who were found to have voted for bitter rival Armenia – claiming it was a matter of “national security”. It’s just one part of a long Eurovision-based war between the two countries, who have an ongoing territorial dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

Eurovision has ramped up tensions between the countries. In 2016, the Armenian entrant caused uproar when she waved the Nagorno-Karabakh flag, prompting the European Broadcast Union (EBU) which runs Eurovision to sanction the Armenian broadcaster [https://metro.co.uk/2016/05/11/armenia-threatened-with-eurovision-disqualification-after-breaking-regional-flag-rule-5875458/] for enflaming “the tense situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh region”. In 2009, an image of a monument near Nagorno-Karabakh’s capital city was edited out of the intro to the Armenian performance after Azerbaijan claimed it was an Azerbaijani landmark. The Armenian voting delegation snuck it on to TV by sticking it to the back of their presenter’s clipboard.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia%E2%80%93Azerbaijan_relations_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest#/media/File:Eurovision_2009_Armenia_voting.png]

Azerbaijan’s Eurovision history is also part of a wider trend – allowing increased freedoms. When it hosted the contest in 2012, despite having an atrocious record of human rights abuses and a government known for suppressing critics, hundreds of citizens were allowed to march through Baku, calling for democracy and freedom of speech. In 2005, when Ukraine hosted, it temporarily loosened[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/732682/Ukraine-drops-visas-for-Eurovision.html] entry restrictions for EU citizens – and ended up permanently leaving its borders more open. Conchita Wurst’s 2014 entry provoked homophobic protests[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/30/russia-boycott-eurovision-gay-parade] from conservative Russian politicians and sparked furious petitions in Belarus, Armenia and Russia demanding she be edited out[https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2014/apr/28/conchita-wurst-austria-eurovision-drag-queen-act-tom-neuwirth?CMP=twt_gu] of the broadcast – yet she won the contest. Her victory may have caused more furore from homophobic Russian MPs[https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2014/may/14/russian-mp-sings-protest-austria-conchita-wurst-eurovision-video], but it also led to the Austrian chancellor announcing his desire to legalise gay marriage[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27462330].

Wurst’s win did, however, highlight one unfortunate part of the contest: vote-rigging. “A lot of the juries didn’t give Conchita the same number of votes as their public,” says Vuletic. “These jurors did not want to be associated with LGBTQ+ issues, as they feared what the professional consequences could be.” Last year, six national panels’ votes were rejected by the EBU due to “irregularities”, leading to a major rule change[https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/22/eurovision-scraps-jury-voting-in-semi-finals] to reduce the juries’ influence. According to Jordan “those juries see each other all the time, so it would be very easy for them to do deals. It’s very tricky to prove, but there are certainly some strange patterns, and it’s always the same repeat offenders.”

For all of this, since 2000 Eurovision has supposedly been a non-political contest due to a rule banning explicit political references. It hasn’t exactly worked, given that the 2016 Ukrainian winner was about Russia’s deportation[https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/14/ukraine-wins-eurovision-jamala-1944] of the Crimean Tatar population in the second world war – resulting in a spiralling battle between the two nations that eventually led Ukraine to forbid Russia’s singer[https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/22/ukraine-bans-russia-eurovision-entrant-over-crimea-tour] from entering the country. It’s also hard not to suspect that at least some of Europe voted for Ukraine to win last year as an expression of solidarity after Putin’s invasion.

But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. After all, one of the things that makes Eurovision so captivating is the politics. “It has the power to bring Europe together to express support for a certain issue – be it the rights of sexual minorities or showing solidarity with Ukraine,” says Vuletic. “That’s why Eurovision is much more powerful than other events.”

It has been decades since energy took on such a central role in global affairs. Oil and gas stocks soared last year as the war in Ukraine upended the market. Now, commodity prices are tumbling again, the stocks are wobbling, and an even bigger change -- a global transition to clean energy -- appears to be around the corner.

To understand how all these dynamics will play out in the coming years, Barron's convened a roundtable of energy experts that met May 9 on Zoom. The group included Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy and Middle East and North Africa research at RBC Capital Markets; Dan Pickering, founder and chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners; Christyan Malek, global head of energy strategy and head of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa oil and gas equity research at J.P. Morgan; and Karim Fawaz, director of financial and capital markets at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

An edited version of the conversation follows.

Barron's: Everything seemed lined up for oil prices to rise after OPEC said last month that it would cut production. Yet, Brent crude, the global benchmark, is still $75 a barrel, and could be heading lower. Let's begin with your oil-price targets for the end of 2023.

Karim Fawaz: A lot of people thought we had escaped the macro headwinds back in April, when OPEC [the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries] initiated voluntary production cuts. Clearly, that hasn't been the case so far. There is still a lot of macro pressure. It is difficult to predict what will happen next month at the OPEC meeting, but we still see sequential demand growth between now and August of around three million barrels a day.

At the same time, you're going to see another million barrels a day of supply come off the market because of OPEC production suspensions as the cuts go into effect. It's very difficult to see a path where energy-market fundamentals don't tighten significantly in the next two quarters, so we remain relatively constructive on prices. We still see Brent prices averaging $92 a barrel in the third quarter, and easing slightly into the end of the year to the mid- to high-$80s.

Dan, what is your price target for crude?

Dan Pickering: Forecasting is notoriously difficult, but to start with the long term, I'm pretty bullish on the next three to five years. I've got an $80 number for West Texas Intermediate [the U.S. benchmark for oil] as an average over that period. I expect things to improve over the remainder of this year, so $75 to $85 WTI at year end is my near-term target. Supply is constrained but demand is the wild card. The market is treating oil as a risk-off or risk-on asset. We should expect volatility, and I'm 100% convinced I'll be wrong on that year-end price number.

Helima, what are your thoughts?

Helima Croft: I echo a lot of what was said. Oil really struggled with this sort of sum-of-all-fears worry. OPEC has shown that they are willing to midwife a recovery. It looks like they're meeting in person in June, which seems a signal that they are willing to do more. There are also other geopolitical factors that continue to be important in the market, but might not be priced in. We still have a pipeline offline in Iraq, with no signs of an imminent restart. The Iran issue remains pretty important for the back half of the year. Right now, oil struggles when everyone focuses on the broader macroeconomic story. The fundamentals should come into the driver's seat at some point in the back half of the year.

So, do you see prices moving higher or lower?

Croft: They could go lower because of macro concerns. But we see a path toward a $90 price environment, based on the fundamentals. And again, there are some wild cards out there on the geopolitical side that aren't even factored in when we talk about $90.

Christyan, let's hear from you.

Christyan Malek: We were bearish from 2013 to 2020. We turned formally bullish on the long term in our supercycle thesis in the spring of 2020, which was a difficult time, for obvious reasons. [A commodity supercycle is a period of sustained expansion, usually characterized by high prices.] Having said that, we have put the supercycle thesis on hold this year, and tend to think that this year is a bit of a write-off for energy. We turned bearish on energy in December of last year, both on the asset class and the commodities. It will be a difficult first half of the year. The rest of the year is highly dependent on the recession outlook. I expect that energy prices will be rangebound through the end of the year. Demand is like a sword hanging over the market.

By rangebound, do you mean Brent will stay in the high-$70s?

Malek: Yes. We have talked about the worst-case scenario being around $60 a barrel this year. OPEC stepped in to protect $60 oil, not $80 [as some other analysts have said]. We can expect more OPEC intervention. In other words, they're not trying to create a higher-price scenario, but protect a really bad scenario from playing out. It's not about trying to stoke the price at the expense of the consumer. If anything, it is protecting investment today to protect the consumer in years to come. Without that investment today, we could see severe energy inflation in the future. We have talked about $200 oil by 2025 as an upside scenario, with $80 being a long-run forecast for Brent.

We are less than a month from another OPEC meeting. OPEC is now in an alliance with Russia, with serious geopolitical implications. Helima, what do you expect to happen?

Croft: It's really about market management. One of the key drivers for Saudi Arabia is to deliver on Vision 2030, its massive infrastructure and job-creation program. It grounds a lot of the country's oil policy. The White House didn't see an OPEC cut coming in October. Because it happened right before the midterm election, everything was seen through the prism of Washington politics, when in fact the Saudis were really trying to put in a circuit breaker to stop oil from falling quickly. I don't see that the Saudis are going to end their relationship with Russia in terms of market management. If oil is in its current price range or potentially even lower at the OPEC meeting next month, then OPEC is prepared to take additional action. They believe they have to support the market until more fundamental factors reassert themselves.

Speaking of Russia, it has been more than a year since the invasion of Ukraine, and the war is still going on. Russian oil is still on the market; it's just moving in different directions. What does this mean for oil and natural gas longer term?

Croft: The Biden administration was clear from the start of the war: It was going to sanction everything, but wanted to keep Russian energy flowing. It was deeply concerned about maintaining popular support for the war in an energy crisis. Primarily, the goal of price caps on Russian oil was to blunt the impact of the European Union's package of sanctions, particularly the ban on oil services to move Russian barrels to third-party markets. That Russian oil is still going in large quantities to India and China was the key objective of price caps.

The Russians themselves decided to take their natural gas off the market. The question is: Has Europe built sufficient supply to get through winter? There is a lot of optimism in EU countries that they have built sufficient stockpiles to get through next winter, and the focus now is on 2024. But the real question is: Has Russia played its last card? Could we potentially see [energy] infrastructure attacks linked to Russia?

What do you think, Karim?

Fawaz: I mostly agree with Helima. The U.S. administration's objective coming into the fall was fairly clear. It was safeguarding oil flows in a way that was destructive to Russian revenue. That has happened, to a large extent, partly because prices have been low enough that the majority of oil exports from Russia have been de facto trading below the price cap. A large share of Russia's fleet has been able to access Western services. What's more interesting to think about is, if prices move higher in the second half of the year, as we expect, and oil suddenly starts to trade near or above the price cap, will the EU start looking to enforce it more stringently?

The commodity that has been inspiring the most debate lately is natural gas, which soared to $9 per million British thermal units last year and crashed to $2 this year. Meanwhile, gas-related stocks haven't fallen as much as the commodity. We're in a relatively lengthy period with a lot of supply and, at least in the U.S., not a ton of export capacity for liquefied natural gas to sell that supply elsewhere. Where do prices for natural gas and the stocks go next, Dan?

Pickering: The siren call of new LNG export capacity in 2025 and 2026 is keeping the market pretty bullish on gas. A couple of LNG projects are coming online in 2025 and '26, so U.S. producers will be able to export more of their product overseas. Despite low prices, you're seeing a reluctance by the industry to slow production activity because no one wants to be behind the curve when the market, in theory, tightens up in late 2025. We're in a Catch-22; the long term is bullish, the short term is bearish. Winter is always a wild card, but no one is expecting much out of natural-gas pricing in the near term. The risk is if LNG exports slip or new projects take longer to build. Then gas will have another leg down in sentiment.

Are you cautious on the stocks of gas-focused producers?

19 May 2023 01:30 ET 11 Picks to Play a Resurgent Energy Sector, From -2-

Pickering: The stocks have fallen. Antero Resources [ticker: AR] has been cut in half. It is starting to look interesting. The question is: What's the catalyst for the stock to work, particularly relative to the oil names? Gas is sort of a no man's land from a stock perspective. The stocks aren't particularly expensive. The companies have their balance sheets in order. There isn't financial distress. I'd rather play oil than gas from a stock market perspective, both the commodity and the companies that produce it. Really, these are 2025 stories, which means you probably get paid next year, not this year.

Christyan, you have written that the world isn't investing enough in energy. But there seems to be plenty of natural gas.

Malek: There is so much additional gas coming online in the next few years. We see a race to the downside in gas. If anything, gas feels like it's on a downward trend with fake highs because so much additional supply is coming online. China is switching a lot of its usage into coal, with less regard for net-zero emissions than it used to have. The extra production coming through in 2025 and '26, whether from Qatar, the U.S., or potentially the Saudis, means having too much gas supply just when demand isn't keeping up.

The reverse is true for oil. Remember the airports last year? You had a 10-minute queue just to get a coffee in Terminal 2 at Heathrow. That was because of very strong travel demand. Oil also carried a risk premium, too, which was a function of the concern around a lack of supply coming from Russia, which ultimately didn't play out. OPEC had to add production to deal with the increase in demand, but also that risk premium. Now we're seeing a mean reversion, or a correction in terms of how much production we need from OPEC to normalize demand. That is true in the West as we move past a partial lockdown and into a potential recession, and in China as we get past lockdown into whatever things look like after Covid.

Just what are you expecting?

Malek: Over the next 12 to 18 months, we're going to progress through this choppy demand outlook as we find our feet, post-Covid. Demand has been [a more important issue than supply this year]. We'll see it switch. In other words, supply becomes king. Demand doesn't have to grow by multimillions of barrels a day every year. What we see in our numbers is supply growth grinding to a halt in 2024 and 2025, predominantly because shale is becoming the marginal-cost producer.

Come two or three years, shale productivity is going to plateau. We don't have another [oil] basin as we did in Angola in the early 2000s. We don't see any incremental quantity of supply past 2024. So how do we solve the deficit? We solve it through the price moving to a point where it starts to hurt demand. At that point, clearly, it's whatever price OPEC is comfortable with.

How high, then, could the oil price go?

Malek: At J.P. Morgan, we believe the world can cope with $150 a barrel. There is plenty of scope to go up without hurting demand. It's very different from any previous cycle. You have ESG [environmental, social, and corporate governance] pressures not to invest in oil. It comes at a higher [cost of capital] than it traditionally has. You have policy that's conducive to clean energy, and ultimately getting in the way of investing in oil. And then -- this is what surprised us the most in our supercycle thesis going out to 2028 and '29 -- the energy transition itself will create the biggest demand shock for oil that we've ever seen.

The energy system needed to get the electrons to the consumer is so materials-intensive, so oil-intensive, that it could be the equivalent of China's growth in the 2000s. The transition will create huge demand for oil, multimillions of barrels, which we can't meet because the energy system is moving toward clean energy. That can exacerbate prices well above $200. It isn't our base case, but I'm just giving you scenarios.

What do the rest of you make of that?

Croft: I broadly agree. It's an interesting dynamic that has been playing out. We discussed the Saudi-Russia relationship earlier. If we think about the energy transition, lack of investment in energy in Europe, pressures around ESG investing, and what is happening in the U.S. shale basin, the last man standing is going to be the national oil companies in the Middle East. That raises a lot of questions about geopolitics, as well.

In the heyday of shale, we talked so much about American energy dominance and what that meant for U.S. foreign policy in terms of the ability to either retreat from a region like the Middle East or sanction countries we didn't like, such as Venezuela or Iran, and shield U.S. consumers from the impact of that policy. We are in the waning days of American energy dominance. Yes, LNG is a big story and we are helping Europe meet its energy needs. But Saudi Aramco, Adnoc [Abu Dhabi National Oil Company], and Kuwait Petroleum are continuing to invest, and they dominate in production of oil.

Karim, you have written about these issues. Any further thoughts?

Fawaz: I would look at it a bit differently. In the early 2000s, we had capital available and a willingness to invest in supply, but we didn't have the resource available [before the U.S. shale revolution]. In the current environment, we have the resource, but the questions are around capital and the willingness of companies to invest.

In the second half of 2021 and in 2022, organic capital generated by the energy industry created sufficient funds to invest in supply in the medium term. Midway through last year, a lot of people were of the view that even in a higher-price environment, companies wouldn't increase capital spending. To some extent in the U.S., that was true as far as [shale] is concerned, although a lot of it was due to service-sector limitations and an inability to invest more even if companies wanted to. Yet, we saw the biggest global-exploration spending on record.

There has been underinvestment in energy production for the past decade. Some countries don't have a lot of projects, but suddenly in the past 18 months they've had enough capital to invest. Outside of the Guyanas, Norways, and Brazils of the world -- all big producers -- production declined by about 600,000 barrels a day in 2020 and 300,000 barrels in 2021. It was flat last year. Capital has gone into existing operations. Over time, the compounding effect can really change the supply picture.

How would you size up demand?

Fawaz: The deceleration of demand matters more than the peak. A lot of people focus on when demand might peak. Is it 2028 or 2030? We think about the point at which the rate of demand growth starts to slow materially, and we see that starting in 2026-27 in a meaningful way, especially for products like gasoline and diesel and jet fuel.

If you think about it from a supply standpoint, the treadmill is slowing. In that context, the U.S. doesn't need to be growing a million barrels a day per year to meet global demand growth. The U.S. needs to grow [supply] by 300,000 barrels a day per year because the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have ambitious growth objectives.

In the medium term, we don't see the ingredients to move into a sustained-scarcity world. We believe, however, that you need a significantly higher oil price than in the past decade. The shale-era price band of $45 to $65 is insufficient to meet demand through the medium term.

Lastly, China is a different element in the oil market that hasn't existed in the past. It is a large consumer with slowing demand over the medium term, access to large inventories, and a willingness to swing imports depending on market conditions.

What are the implications of that?

Fawaz: The market avoided a catastrophic drawdown of oil inventories through last summer only because China took a three-month breather on imports of an average of about 2.5 million barrels a day. You now have an actor on the consumer side of the ledger that is able to regulate the upside in prices, to some extent.

Let's transition to the energy transition. Given that all of you seem to see oil growing more expensive in the next few years, is this shaping up to be a lucrative last hurrah for the commodity?

Malek: The energy supercycle will last well into the 2030s. We will [have too little] oil well before we no longer need it. That lifts prices of old-economy stocks -- of oil, gas, and even coal producers. We're positioned bullishly in energy stocks that have a bias toward carbon and fossil fuels. It's a relatively cautious moment if you have a six-month horizon, but those looking out over the next few years will want to prioritize companies that can grow their oil volumes. It is dangerous to say that this is the last hurrah, unless you define a last hurrah as 20 years. You want to own companies that can grow their joules of energy while decarbonizing and generating cash flow.

Energy accounts for 4% to 5% of the S&P 500. Should investors seek to double that exposure in their portfolios?

Malek: I would suggest at least 10%.

Would you put a significant portion of that in alternative-energy stocks?

Malek. No. Alternative energy and renewables are significantly overvalued. Returns are suffering because of cost inflation. Interest rates are going up. It's almost like shale 2.0, where everyone is chasing growth and thinks about returns later. Returns will diminish and companies will struggle to deliver. It is likely that old-economy stocks re-rate higher as cash flow grows, and clean-energy stocks de-rate as delivery disappoints.

19 May 2023 01:30 ET 11 Picks to Play a Resurgent Energy Sector, From -3-

Croft: In the West, we are having one conversation on the energy transition, and the developing world is having a very different conversation. At COP 28 [the United Nations' global climate conference scheduled for November], you're going to see debates about what is the best transition. If you listen to conversations from Indian officials, from sub-Saharan African officials, they're still focused on affordability. When millions of people use biomass to heat their homes, are you going to go immediately to solar? Or are you going to focus on what is the cheapest, most reliable form of energy? The developing world is an important driver of demand.

Dan, how should investors approach both conventional and alternative energy?

Pickering: They ought to be overweight energy. I recommend an 85/15 split between conventional and energy-transition names. The only reason you do 15% is to learn about the sector so you can spend a lot of time investing in it in the 2030s. It's still too early. It's the shiny new toy that is overcapitalized. The conventional stuff is trading for four to six times cash flow. Energy has been the best sector in the market for two years, but still has reluctant owners. The stocks are probably discounting $65 oil.

That's a perfect segue to your stock picks. Dan, you're based in Texas, an epicenter of the shale revolution. There is concern that the boom is ending. Is that true, and if so, how does it influence your investing?

Pickering: The shale story is plateauing. The assets aren't getting a heck of a lot better from here. That has positive implications. If U.S. shale isn't going to deliver big volumes, then that is supportive for oil prices and probably for aggregate valuation. But there are still great stories within the shale patch, and we'll see consolidation in that sector. When I think about stocks, I pick two out in the Permian, because it's the lowest-cost basin. One is a mid-cap, Permian Resources [PR], with about a $5 billion market cap. The other is Diamondback Energy [FANG], with about a $23 billion market cap.

Both companies have a significant inventory, which will become more valuable in the next three to five years. Both are well managed. They are both likely takeout candidates at some point, as bigger companies consolidate the business. And both have good cost structures and acreage positions.

Diamondback trades for about five times cash flow. It discounts about $65 oil. If you discount $80-a-barrel oil, it would trade at $195 [up from around $130]. The company has been a tactical acquirer, and will continue to be. It is committed to returning 75% of its free cash flow, so it is giving investors what they want in terms of return of capital. It is relatively low-growth. The growth will come through acquisitions.

What do you like about Permian Resources?

Pickering: Permian Resources is a bit different. It's a 10% volume grower annually. It's a $10 stock that probably trades at $20 if oil is 80 bucks. The management team is young and aggressive. There is a bit of an overhang from private-equity ownership that owns about 40% of the stock. But as private equity sells down, you're going to have a company that investors want to own for the oil leverage. You can play shale, but be selective. It isn't without volatility, so you'd better be able to stomach that.

Those are interesting picks, but what is the catalyst for a move up? The stocks have languished lately.

Pickering: Demand uncertainty and recession are overhangs. The catalyst would be that, if oil prices rise, you're going to wake up in two years and these names are going to be 30% to 50% higher because they're returning a lot of cash to shareholders. They're buying back shares. You're going to wake up and energy might not be any more popular, but it is going to be more valuable. So the catalyst could be the commodity, and consolidation. You can't count on either in the very near term, so you'd better own names that you like, and that are adding value along the way.

Will ESG concerns continue to weigh on the stocks?

Pickering: The ESG dynamic is probably plateauing, as well. The reality is, it was easy to hate these companies for the past couple of years because they burned you for five-plus years. They destroyed a lot of capital in the shale boom. When they're returning cash and generating 10% to 30% free cash yields, it's a heck of a lot harder to hate them. Some investors are never going to play. That's OK, so the universe of buyers is smaller. But these companies are making money, and I expect that you will see investors gradually and grudgingly return.

Malek: I second Dan's point on this. I meet with a lot of the CIOs [chief investment officers] in Europe. I asked one in Sweden, "At what point would you get involved in energy?" And he said, "Once it gets to 7% to 8% of the index, we have a problem. Then you are underperforming your own [stock market] benchmarks."

There's a pain threshold. It has been OK not to be in energy, because it has underperformed, so there has been no FOMO [fear of missing out]. But as energy outperforms, then it starts to become a larger part of the index and you can't ignore it. Also, policy makers are realizing that the energy system needs a huge amount of current energy sources. So, the companies need to be requalified away from being bad to good. They become part of the solution. Those two things will converge within the next two or three years. They are around the corner.

Christyan, you have written positively about some European oil companies. Which do you like now?

Malek: The best-placed companies are TotalEnergies [TTE], Shell [SHEL], and Galp Energia [GLPEY]. The reason these companies are best-placed, particularly TotalEnergies, is because they have a significant amount of runway to produce oil, gas, and gigawatts while also lowering their carbon footprint and returning lots of cash.

Fast-forward two or three years, and you'll start to see bifurcation. You'll see companies transitioning too quickly at the expense of their own cash return, because they've sold the oil. You'll also see companies that have managed to hold it all together, producing all forms of energy, without reducing their oil footprint, generating the cash flow and cash return. My favorite names are TotalEnergies and Shell.

Do you like any U.S. or Middle East names?

Malek: Globally, we like Exxon Mobil [XOM] and Saudi Arabian Oil [ARAMCO.Saudi Arabia], and Diamondback is one of our favorites, as well as Marathon Oil [MRO]. We like companies that have a disproportionate skew to oil-volume growth, which then generates lots of cash flow. But a really important thing is distinguishing between investors. Investors in Europe do care about carbon. Global investors and U.S. investors aren't saying it's irrelevant, but it is going to be cash flow that speaks to them the most. Can I convince a European investor to buy an Exxon? Quite difficult. Is Exxon one of our top picks? Absolutely, because it can grow oil production and produce lots of cash flow. Doesn't look so well on the carbon.

Dan, are there any oil servicers or companies in other subindustries that you like?

Pickering: I've got two names to talk about One is a small-cap offshore-drilling company, Diamond Offshore Drilling [DO]. It's about a billion-dollar market cap. This sector was left for dead, but the world is coming back to offshore. The supply of rigs has dwindled because of retirements. Demand is improving. Day rates, which bottomed at $200,000 a day to rent one of those rigs, are now like $400,000 a day. The stock could double, as nothing else needs to happen except oil holds at $70 to $75 a barrel.

Schlumberger [now called SLB (SLB)] isn't a cheap name, at 15 times earnings or so, but it is the international leader in oil servicing. It is a global provider of services to all of the big oil-and-gas companies worldwide. It is consistently profitable, with good cash generation, and it is buying back shares, albeit slowly.

Malek: I'll second that. This sector is constantly being viewed as a cyclical sector. If you arrive at a supercycle, it isn't cyclical anymore. It is idiosyncratic. It isn't growth, it isn't value. It isn't momentum. To carry on from Dan's point, I remember when Schlumberger was trading at 28 to 30 times earnings. Everyone said it was too expensive. It got more expensive. When you think about how we're short of oil, and this company can deliver it through its services, you don't question the valuation. This is a structural upcycle. I'm less concerned about whether we're in a recession in three years, because we just don't have the supply of energy, and therefore valuation is less relevant.

Christyan, are there any clean-energy-focused names you would buy now?

Malek: At the moment, we're not that bullish on clean energy. We're still waiting to see valuations come in. But if they do, I'd argue that Orsted [DNNGY] and Engie [ENGIY] could do well. NextEra Energy [NEE] is another popular name. We may see eventual consolidation among the majors and clean energy. It's not about finding the right valuation. It's also looking at who is the most susceptible to being acquired.

Pickering: I am not in love with anything on the energy-transition or the clean- energy side. Ironically, Tesla is [TSLA] the biggest market cap that falls into the new-energies category, and that stock is interesting at $120, and uninteresting at $200. It's in the middle now. Everything else isn't profitable, is burning cash, needs to raise money, or is expensive. You need to spend a lot of time in the sector, getting to know these companies and the technologies, but I don't think you need to own it. The investment here is your time, not your money.

What needs to happen for these areas to be investible?

19 May 2023 01:30 ET 11 Picks to Play a Resurgent Energy Sector, From -4-

Pickering: It's really the time it is going to take to move these companies toward profitability. Some have raised enough money to be able to make it to profitability, but it's the process of getting there. In the meantime, you've got a bunch of companies that are going to go broke.

To wrap up, what might surprise people in energy over the next year?

Malek: As I said, demand is king. And it could disappoint. What a cocktail we're facing: higher mortgage rates, expensive everything. My biggest worry is that China could become very different socioeconomically, industrially, behaviorally than it was previously, and it doesn't really catch up [to its previous trajectory]. In that case, we can talk underinvestment all day long, but it will take a while before that deficit materializes, ultimately because demand disappoints.

Croft: We are into the second year of the Russia-Ukraine war. We have become so complacent. Even in Washington, the view is that Russia played its cards, and is a spent force. What would surprise us is a decision in Moscow to cause significant economic pain for the West -- that they aren't done. We shouldn't take off our radar the possibility that Russia still tries to change Western calculations about continued support for Ukraine. As long as the West continues to supply Ukraine with more weapons, the war from Russia's standpoint is difficult to win.

Pickering: I have four potential surprises. The demand side can surprise us. I'm estimating $80 oil. If it's $60, something happened with demand -- we didn't have a moderate recession; we had a severe recession. The second follows on Helima's comment about Russia, although I'd take a different tack. If peace breaks out, oil goes down. It probably shouldn't, but it will, at least in the near term. If peace breaks out, that could be surprising.

I also wrote the word stagflation. If inflation is stickier than people think, oil is likely a contributing factor and investors will be making inflation plays. Energy would certainly be a part of that trade. Lastly, what if we see a wave of takeouts? It's not just that Exxon would buy Pioneer Natural Resources [PXD], which has been rumored, but what if Exxon bought ConocoPhillips [COP]? Those would be four potential surprises, none of which are in our base case.

Karim, what's on your mind?

Fawaz: To echo a lot of what has been said already, demand is still the biggest concern in the short term. In terms of something harder to visualize, the past 12 months, especially 2022, was the year of intense government intervention [in sanctioning Russian oil and more]. To some extent, that slowed down over the past four months. There's a sense of complacency that we went through this wave of intervention and now we're normalizing. But the reality is, you can end up in a pre-interventionist environment pretty quickly if markets break out of this quasi-comfortable range. If prices move closer to $100 a barrel, does the U.S. administration change the way it is thinking about these things -- and vice versa on the downside? OPEC countries have significant modernization needs, so how that friction emerges in the next two years is also going to be interesting.

I was just in New York and Boston, talking with a lot of our investor clients. This is the first time in 10 years that I didn't get a single question about U.S. shale. That is interesting to me. To some extent, U.S. exploration and production companies have succeeded in making themselves boring and stopped being disrupters, which they have wanted to do for a number of years. But this system is still dynamic. This year is difficult, but over the next couple of years, you might start to see more comfort with potentially moving from 0% to 5% [production growth] to 3% to 7% production growth. You might also see consolidation in the hands of producers that are more comfortable growing than the current operators. We're one U.S. supply overshoot away from supply abundance getting back in the narrative. It's a low-likelihood outcome, but if the U.S. overshoots one more time, it's difficult to see how this sector gets on a sustainably more bullish trajectory in the medium term.

That's a lot to think about. Thank you, all.

19 May 2023 16:05 ET 11 Picks to Play a Resurgent Energy Sector, From Our Roundtable Experts -- Barrons.com

By Avi Salzman

It has been decades since energy took on such a central role in global affairs. Oil and gas stocks soared last year as the war in Ukraine upended the market. Now, commodity prices are tumbling again, the stocks are wobbling, and an even bigger change -- a global transition to clean energy -- appears to be around the corner.

To understand how all of these dynamics will play out in the coming years, Barron's convened a roundtable of energy experts that met on May 9 on Zoom. The group included Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy and Middle East and North Africa research at RBC Capital Markets; Dan Pickering, founder and chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners; Christyan Malek, global head of energy strategy and head of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa oil and gas equity research at J.P. Morgan; and Karim Fawaz, director of financial and capital markets at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

An edited version of the conversation follows.

Barron's: Everything seemed lined up for oil prices to rise after OPEC said last month that it would cut production. Yet, Brent crude, the global benchmark, is still $75 a barrel, and could be heading lower. Let's begin with your oil-price targets for the end of 2023.

Karim Fawaz: A lot of people thought we had escaped the macro headwinds back in April, when OPEC [the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries] initiated voluntary production cuts. Clearly, that hasn't been the case so far. There is still a lot of macro pressure. It is difficult to predict what will happen next month at the OPEC meeting, but we still see sequential demand growth between now and August of around three million barrels a day.

At the same time, you're going to see another million barrels a day of supply come off the market because of OPEC production suspensions as the cuts go into effect. It's very difficult to see a path where energy-market fundamentals don't tighten significantly in the next two quarters, so we remain relatively constructive on prices. We still see Brent prices averaging $92 a barrel in the third quarter, and easing slightly into the end of the year to the mid- to high-$80s.

Dan, what is your price target for crude?

Dan Pickering: Forecasting is notoriously difficult, but to start with the long term, I'm pretty bullish on the next three to five years. I've got an $80 number for West Texas Intermediate [the U.S. benchmark for oil] as an average over that period. I expect things to improve over the remainder of this year, so $75 to $85 WTI at year end is my near-term target. Supply is constrained, but demand is the wild card. The market is treating oil as a risk-off or risk-on asset. We should expect volatility, and I'm 100% convinced I'll be wrong on that year-end price number.

Helima, what are your thoughts?

Helima Croft: I echo a lot of what was said. Oil really struggled with this sort of sum-of-all-fears worry. OPEC has shown that they are willing to midwife a recovery. It looks like they're meeting in person in June, which seems a signal that they are willing to do more. There are also other geopolitical factors that continue to be important in the market, but might not be priced in. We still have a pipeline off-line in Iraq, with no signs of an imminent restart. The Iran issue remains pretty important for the back half of the year. Right now, oil struggles when everyone focuses on the broader macroeconomic story. The fundamentals should come into the driver's seat at some point in the back half of the year.

So, do you see prices moving higher or lower?

Croft: They could go lower because of macro concerns. But we see a path toward a $90 price environment, based on the fundamentals. And again, there are some wild cards out there on the geopolitical side that aren't even factored in when we talk about $90.

Christyan, let's hear from you.

Christyan Malek: We were bearish from 2013 to 2020. We turned formally bullish on the long term in our supercycle thesis in the spring of 2020, which was a difficult time, for obvious reasons. [A commodity supercycle is a period of sustained expansion, usually characterized by high prices.] Having said that, we have put the supercycle thesis on hold this year, and tend to think that this year is a bit of a write-off for energy. We turned bearish on energy in December of last year, both on the asset class and the commodities. It will be a difficult first half of the year. The rest of the year is highly dependent on the recession outlook. I expect that energy prices will be range-bound through the end of the year. Demand is like a sword hanging over the market.

By range-bound, do you mean that Brent will stay in the high-$70s?

Malek: Yes. We have talked about the worst-case scenario being around $60 a barrel this year. OPEC stepped in to protect $60 oil, not $80 [as some other analysts have said]. We can expect more OPEC intervention. In other words, they're not trying to create a higher-price scenario, but protect a really bad scenario from playing out. It's not about trying to stoke the price at the expense of the consumer. If anything, it is protecting investment today to protect the consumer in years to come. Without that investment today, we could see severe energy inflation in the future. We have talked about $200 oil by 2025 as an upside scenario, with $80 being a long-run forecast for Brent.

We are less than a month from another OPEC meeting. OPEC is now in an alliance with Russia, with serious geopolitical implications. Helima, what do you expect to happen?

Croft: It's really about market management. One of the key drivers for Saudi Arabia is to deliver on Vision 2030, its massive infrastructure and job-creation program. It grounds a lot of the country's oil policy. The White House didn't see an OPEC cut coming in October. Because it happened right before the midterm election, everything was seen through the prism of Washington politics, when in fact the Saudis were really trying to put in a circuit breaker to stop oil from falling quickly. I don't see that the Saudis are going to end their relationship with Russia in terms of market management. If oil is in its current price range or potentially even lower at the OPEC meeting next month, then OPEC is prepared to take additional action. They believe they have to support the market until more fundamental factors reassert themselves.

Speaking of Russia, it has been more than a year since the invasion of Ukraine, and the war is still going on. Russian oil is still on the market; it's just moving in different directions. What does this mean for oil and natural gas longer term?

Croft: The Biden administration was clear from the start of the war: It was going to sanction everything, but wanted to keep Russian energy flowing. It was deeply concerned about maintaining popular support for the war in an energy crisis. Primarily, the goal of price caps on Russian oil was to blunt the impact of the European Union's package of sanctions, particularly the ban on oil services to move Russian barrels to third-party markets. That Russian oil is still going in large quantities to India and China was the key objective of price caps.

The Russians themselves decided to take their natural gas off the market. The question is: Has Europe built sufficient supply to get through winter? There is a lot of optimism in EU countries that they have built sufficient stockpiles to get through next winter, and the focus now is on 2024. But the real question is: Has Russia played its last card? Could we potentially see [energy] infrastructure attacks linked to Russia?

What do you think, Karim?

Fawaz: I mostly agree with Helima. The U.S. administration's objective coming into the fall was fairly clear. It was safeguarding oil flows in a way that was destructive to Russian revenue. That has happened, to a large extent, partly because prices have been low enough that the majority of oil exports from Russia have been de facto trading below the price cap. A large share of Russia's fleet has been able to access Western services. What's more interesting to think about is, if prices move higher in the second half of the year, as we expect, and oil suddenly starts to trade near or above the price cap, will the EU start looking to enforce it more stringently?

The commodity that has been inspiring the most debate lately is natural gas, which soared to $9 per million British thermal units last year and crashed to $2 this year. Meanwhile, gas-related stocks haven't fallen as much as the commodity. We're in a relatively lengthy period with a lot of supply and, at least in the U.S., not a ton of export capacity for liquefied natural gas to sell that supply elsewhere. Where do prices for natural gas and the stocks go next, Dan?

Pickering: The siren call of new LNG export capacity in 2025 and 2026 is keeping the market pretty bullish on gas. A couple of LNG projects are coming on-line in 2025 and '26, so U.S. producers will be able to export more of their product overseas. Despite low prices, you're seeing a reluctance by the industry to slow production activity because no one wants to be behind the curve when the market, in theory, tightens up in late 2025. We're in a Catch-22; the long term is bullish; the short term is bearish. Winter is always a wild card, but no one is expecting much out of natural-gas pricing in the near term. The risk is if LNG exports slip or new projects take longer to build. Then, gas will have another leg down in sentiment.

Are you cautious on the stocks of gas-focused producers?

19 May 2023 16:05 ET 11 Picks to Play a Resurgent Energy Sector, From -2-

Pickering: The stocks have fallen. Antero Resources [ticker: AR] has been cut in half. It is starting to look interesting. The question is: What's the catalyst for the stock to work, particularly relative to the oil names? Gas is sort of a no man's land from a stock perspective. The stocks aren't particularly expensive. The companies have their balance sheets in order. There isn't financial distress. I'd rather play oil than gas from a stock market perspective, both the commodity and the companies that produce it. Really, these are 2025 stories, which means you probably get paid next year, not this year.

Christyan, you have written that the world isn't investing enough in energy. But there seems to be plenty of natural gas.

Malek: There is so much additional gas coming on-line in the next few years. We see a race to the downside in gas. If anything, gas feels like it's on a downward trend with fake highs because so much additional supply is coming on-line. China is switching a lot of its usage into coal, with less regard for net-zero emissions than it used to have. The extra production coming through in 2025 and '26, whether from Qatar, the U.S., or potentially the Saudis, means having too much gas supply just when demand isn't keeping up.

The reverse is true for oil. Remember the airports last year? You had a 10-minute queue just to get a coffee in Terminal 2 at Heathrow. That was because of very strong travel demand. Oil also carried a risk premium, too, which was a function of the concern around a lack of supply coming from Russia, which ultimately didn't play out. OPEC had to add production to deal with the increase in demand, but also that risk premium. Now, we're seeing a mean reversion, or a correction in terms of how much production we need from OPEC to normalize demand. That is true in the West as we move past a partial lockdown and into a potential recession, and in China as we get past lockdown into whatever things look like after Covid.

Just what are you expecting?

Malek: Over the next 12 to 18 months, we're going to progress through this choppy demand outlook as we find our feet, post-Covid. Demand has been [a more important issue than supply this year]. We'll see it switch. In other words, supply becomes king. Demand doesn't have to grow by multimillions of barrels a day every year. What we see in our numbers is supply growth grinding to a halt in 2024 and 2025, predominantly because shale is becoming the marginal-cost producer.

Come two or three years, shale productivity is going to plateau. We don't have another [oil] basin as we did in Angola in the early 2000s. We don't see any incremental quantity of supply past 2024. So, how do we solve the deficit? We solve it through the price moving to a point where it starts to hurt demand. At that point, clearly, it's whatever price OPEC is comfortable with.

How high, then, could the oil price go?

Malek: At J.P. Morgan, we believe the world can cope with $150 a barrel. There is plenty of scope to go up without hurting demand. It's very different from any previous cycle. You have ESG [environmental, social, and corporate governance] pressures not to invest in oil. It comes at a higher [cost of capital] than it traditionally has. You have policy that's conducive to clean energy, and ultimately getting in the way of investing in oil. And then -- this is what surprised us the most in our supercycle thesis going out to 2028 and '29 -- the energy transition itself will create the biggest demand shock for oil that we've ever seen.

The energy system needed to get the electrons to the consumer is so materials-intensive, so oil-intensive, that it could be the equivalent of China's growth in the 2000s. The transition will create huge demand for oil, multimillions of barrels, which we can't meet because the energy system is moving toward clean energy. That can exacerbate prices well above $200. It isn't our base case, but I'm just giving you scenarios.

What do the rest of you make of that?

Croft: I broadly agree. It's an interesting dynamic that has been playing out. We discussed the Saudi-Russia relationship earlier. If we think about the energy transition, lack of investment in energy in Europe, pressures around ESG investing, and what is happening in the U.S. shale basin, the last man standing is going to be the national oil companies in the Middle East. That raises a lot of questions about geopolitics, as well.

In the heyday of shale, we talked so much about American energy dominance and what that meant for U.S. foreign policy in terms of the ability to either retreat from a region like the Middle East or sanction countries we didn't like, such as Venezuela or Iran, and shield U.S. consumers from the impact of that policy. We are in the waning days of American energy dominance. Yes, LNG is a big story, and we are helping Europe meet its energy needs. But Saudi Aramco, Adnoc [Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.], and Kuwait Petroleum are continuing to invest, and they dominate in production of oil.

Karim, you have written about these issues. Any further thoughts?

Fawaz: I would look at it a bit differently. In the early 2000s, we had capital available and a willingness to invest in supply, but we didn't have the resource available [before the U.S. shale revolution]. In the current environment, we have the resource, but the questions are around capital and the willingness of companies to invest.

In the second half of 2021 and in 2022, organic capital generated by the energy industry created sufficient funds to invest in supply in the medium term. Midway through last year, a lot of people were of the view that even in a higher-price environment, companies wouldn't increase capital spending. To some extent in the U.S., that was true as far as [shale] is concerned, although a lot of it was due to service-sector limitations and an inability to invest more even if companies wanted to. Yet, we saw the biggest global-exploration spending on record.

There has been underinvestment in energy production for the past decade. Some countries don't have a lot of projects, but suddenly in the past 18 months they've had enough capital to invest. Outside of the Guyanas, Norways, and Brazils of the world -- all big producers -- production declined by about 600,000 barrels a day in 2020 and 300,000 barrels in 2021. It was flat last year. Capital has gone into existing operations. Over time, the compounding effect can really change the supply picture.

How would you size up demand?

Fawaz: The deceleration of demand matters more than the peak. A lot of people focus on when demand might peak. Is it 2028 or 2030? We think about the point at which the rate of demand growth starts to slow materially, and we see that starting in 2026-27 in a meaningful way, especially for products like gasoline and diesel and jet fuel.

If you think about it from a supply standpoint, the treadmill is slowing. In that context, the U.S. doesn't need to be growing a million barrels a day per year to meet global demand growth. The U.S. needs to grow [supply] by 300,000 barrels a day per year because the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have ambitious growth objectives.

In the medium term, we don't see the ingredients to move into a sustained-scarcity world. We believe, however, that you need a significantly higher oil price than in the past decade. The shale-era price band of $45 to $65 is insufficient to meet demand through the medium term.

Lastly, China is a different element in the oil market that hasn't existed in the past. It is a large consumer with slowing demand over the medium term, access to large inventories, and a willingness to swing imports depending on market conditions.

What are the implications of that?

Fawaz: The market avoided a catastrophic drawdown of oil inventories through last summer only because China took a three-month breather on imports of an average of about 2.5 million barrels a day. You now have an actor on the consumer side of the ledger that is able to regulate the upside in prices, to some extent.

Let's transition to the energy transition. Given that all of you seem to see oil growing more expensive in the next few years, is this shaping up to be a lucrative last hurrah for the commodity?

Malek: The energy supercycle will last well into the 2030s. We will [have too little] oil well before we no longer need it. That lifts prices of old-economy stocks -- of oil, gas, and even coal producers. We're positioned bullishly in energy stocks that have a bias toward carbon and fossil fuels. It's a relatively cautious moment if you have a six-month horizon, but those looking out over the next few years will want to prioritize companies that can grow their oil volumes. It is dangerous to say that this is the last hurrah, unless you define a last hurrah as 20 years. You want to own companies that can grow their joules of energy while decarbonizing and generating cash flow.

Energy accounts for 4% to 5% of the S&P 500 index. Should investors seek to double that exposure in their portfolios?

Malek: I would suggest at least 10%.

Would you put a significant portion of that in alternative-energy stocks?

Malek. No. Alternative energy and renewables are significantly overvalued. Returns are suffering because of cost inflation. Interest rates are going up. It's almost like shale 2.0, where everyone is chasing growth and thinks about returns later. Returns will diminish, and companies will struggle to deliver. It is likely that old-economy stocks re-rate higher as cash flow grows, and clean-energy stocks de-rate as delivery disappoints.

19 May 2023 16:05 ET 11 Picks to Play a Resurgent Energy Sector, From -3-

Croft: In the West, we are having one conversation on the energy transition, and the developing world is having a very different conversation. At COP 28 [the United Nations' global climate conference scheduled for November], you're going to see debates about what is the best transition. If you listen to conversations from Indian officials, from sub-Saharan African officials, they're still focused on affordability. When millions of people use biomass to heat their homes, are you going to go immediately to solar? Or are you going to focus on what is the cheapest, most reliable form of energy? The developing world is an important driver of demand.

Dan, how should investors approach both conventional and alternative energy?

Pickering: They ought to be overweight energy. I recommend an 85/15 split between conventional and energy-transition names. The only reason you do 15% is to learn about the sector so you can spend a lot of time investing in it in the 2030s. It's still too early. It's the shiny new toy that is overcapitalized. The conventional stuff is trading for four to six times cash flow. Energy has been the best sector in the market for two years, but still has reluctant owners. The stocks are probably discounting $65 oil.

That's a perfect segue to your stock picks. Dan, you're based in Texas, an epicenter of the shale revolution. There is concern that the boom is ending. Is that true, and if so, how does it influence your investing?

Pickering: The shale story is plateauing. The assets aren't getting a heck of a lot better from here. That has positive implications. If U.S. shale isn't going to deliver big volumes, then that is supportive for oil prices and probably for aggregate valuation. But there are still great stories within the shale patch, and we'll see consolidation in that sector. When I think about stocks, I pick two out in the Permian, because it's the lowest-cost basin. One is a mid-cap, Permian Resources [PR], with about a $5 billion market cap. The other is Diamondback Energy [FANG], with about a $23 billion market cap.

Both companies have a significant inventory, which will become more valuable in the next three to five years. Both are well managed. They are both likely takeout candidates at some point, as bigger companies consolidate the business. And both have good cost structures and acreage positions.

Diamondback trades for about five times cash flow. It discounts about $65 oil. If you discount $80-a-barrel oil, it would trade at $195 [up from about $130]. The company has been a tactical acquirer, and will continue to be. It is committed to returning 75% of its free cash flow, so it is giving investors what they want in terms of return of capital. It is relatively low-growth. The growth will come through acquisitions.

What do you like about Permian Resources?

Pickering: Permian Resources is a bit different. It's a 10% volume grower annually. It's a $10 stock that probably trades at $20 if oil is 80 bucks. The management team is young and aggressive. There is a bit of an overhang from private-equity ownership that owns about 40% of the stock. But as private equity sells down, you're going to have a company that investors want to own for the oil leverage. You can play shale, but be selective. It isn't without volatility, so you'd better be able to stomach that.

Those are interesting picks, but what is the catalyst for a move up? The stocks have languished lately.

Pickering: Demand uncertainty and recession are overhangs. The catalyst would be that, if oil prices rise, you're going to wake up in two years and these names are going to be 30% to 50% higher because they're returning a lot of cash to shareholders. They're buying back shares. You're going to wake up, and energy might not be any more popular, but it is going to be more valuable. So, the catalyst could be the commodity, and consolidation. You can't count on either in the very near term, so you'd better own names that you like, and that are adding value along the way.

Will ESG concerns continue to weigh on the stocks?

Pickering: The ESG dynamic is probably plateauing, as well. The reality is, it was easy to hate these companies for the past couple of years because they burned you for five-plus years. They destroyed a lot of capital in the shale boom. When they're returning cash and generating 10% to 30% free cash yields, it's a heck of a lot harder to hate them. Some investors are never going to play. That's OK, so the universe of buyers is smaller. But these companies are making money, and I expect that you will see investors gradually and grudgingly return.

Malek: I second Dan's point on this. I meet with a lot of the CIOs [chief investment officers] in Europe. I asked one in Sweden, "At what point would you get involved in energy?" And he said, "Once it gets to 7% to 8% of the index, we have a problem. Then you are underperforming your own [stock market] benchmarks."

There's a pain threshold. It has been OK not to be in energy because it has underperformed, so there has been no FOMO [fear of missing out]. But as energy outperforms, then it starts to become a larger part of the index, and you can't ignore it. Also, policy makers are realizing that the energy system needs a huge amount of current energy sources. So, the companies need to be requalified away from being bad to good. They become part of the solution. Those two things will converge within the next two or three years. They are around the corner.

Christyan, you have written positively about some European oil companies. Which do you like now?

Malek: The best-placed companies are TotalEnergies [TTE], Shell [SHEL], and Galp Energia [GLPEY]. The reason these companies are best placed, particularly TotalEnergies, is because they have a significant amount of runway to produce oil, gas, and gigawatts while also lowering their carbon footprint and returning lots of cash.

Fast-forward two or three years and you'll start to see bifurcation. You'll see companies transitioning too quickly at the expense of their own cash return, because they've sold the oil. You'll also see companies that have managed to hold it all together, producing all forms of energy, without reducing their oil footprint, generating the cash flow and cash return. My favorite names are TotalEnergies and Shell.

Do you like any U.S. or Middle East names?

Malek: Globally, we like Exxon Mobil [XOM] and Saudi Arabian Oil [ARAMCO.Saudi Arabia], and Diamondback is one of our favorites, as well as Marathon Oil [MRO]. We like companies that have a disproportionate skew to oil-volume growth, which then generates lots of cash flow. But a really important thing is distinguishing between investors. Investors in Europe do care about carbon. Global investors and U.S. investors aren't saying it's irrelevant, but it is going to be cash flow that speaks to them the most. Can I persuade a European investor to buy an Exxon? Quite difficult. Is Exxon one of our top picks? Absolutely, because it can grow oil production and produce lots of cash flow. Doesn't look so well on the carbon.

Dan, are there any oil servicers or companies in other subindustries that you like?

Pickering: I've got two names to talk about. One is a small-cap offshore-drilling company, Diamond Offshore Drilling [DO]. It's about a billion-dollar market cap. This sector was left for dead, but the world is coming back to offshore. The supply of rigs has dwindled because of retirements. Demand is improving. Day rates, which bottomed at $200,000 a day to rent one of those rigs, are now like $400,000 a day. The stock could double, as nothing else needs to happen except oil holds at $70 to $75 a barrel.

Schlumberger [now called SLB (SLB)] isn't a cheap name at 15 times earnings or so, but it is the international leader in oil servicing. It is a global provider of services to all of the big oil-and-gas companies worldwide. It is consistently profitable, with good cash generation, and it is buying back shares, albeit slowly.

Malek: I'll second that. This sector is constantly being viewed as a cyclical sector. If you arrive at a supercycle, it isn't cyclical anymore. It is idiosyncratic. It isn't growth; it isn't value. It isn't momentum. To carry on from Dan's point, I remember when Schlumberger was trading at 28 to 30 times earnings. Everyone said it was too expensive. It got more expensive. When you think about how we're short of oil, and this company can deliver it through its services, you don't question the valuation. This is a structural upcycle. I'm less concerned about whether we're in a recession in three years because we just don't have the supply of energy, and therefore valuation is less relevant.

Christyan, are there any clean-energy-focused names you would buy now?

Malek: At the moment, we're not that bullish on clean energy. We're still waiting to see valuations come in. But if they do, I'd argue that Orsted [DNNGY] and Engie [ENGIY] could do well. NextEra Energy [NEE] is another popular name. We may see eventual consolidation among the majors and clean energy. It's not about finding the right valuation. It's also looking at who is the most susceptible to being acquired.

Pickering: I am not in love with anything on the energy-transition or the clean-energy side. Ironically, Tesla is [TSLA] the biggest market cap that falls into the new-energies category, and that stock is interesting at $120, and uninteresting at $200. It's in the middle now. Everything else isn't profitable, is burning cash, needs to raise money, or is expensive. You need to spend a lot of time in the sector, getting to know these companies and the technologies, but I don't think you need to own it. The investment here is your time, not your money.

What needs to happen for these areas to be investible?

Pickering: It's really the time it is going to take to move these companies toward profitability. Some have raised enough money to be able to make it to profitability, but it's the process of getting there. In the meantime, you've got a bunch of companies that are going to go broke.

To wrap up, what might surprise people in energy over the next year?

Malek: As I said, demand is king. And it could disappoint. What a cocktail we're facing: higher mortgage rates, expensive everything. My biggest worry is that China could become very different socioeconomically, industrially, behaviorally than it was previously, and it doesn't really catch up [to its previous trajectory]. In that case, we can talk underinvestment all day long, but it will take a while before that deficit materializes, ultimately because demand disappoints.

Croft: We are into the second year of the Russia-Ukraine war. We have become so complacent. Even in Washington, the view is that Russia played its cards and is a spent force. What would surprise us is a decision in Moscow to cause significant economic pain for the West -- that they aren't done. We shouldn't take off our radar the possibility that Russia still tries to change Western calculations about continued support for Ukraine. As long as the West continues to supply Ukraine with more weapons, the war from Russia's standpoint is difficult to win.

Pickering: I have four potential surprises. The demand side can surprise us. I'm estimating $80 oil. If it's $60, something happened with demand -- we didn't have a moderate recession; we had a severe recession. The second follows on Helima's comment about Russia, although I'd take a different tack. If peace breaks out, oil goes down. It probably shouldn't, but it will, at least in the near term. If peace breaks out, that could be surprising.

I also wrote the word stagflation. If inflation is stickier than people think, oil is likely a contributing factor, and investors will be making inflation plays. Energy would certainly be a part of that trade. Lastly, what if we see a wave of takeouts? It's not just that Exxon would buy Pioneer Natural Resources [PXD], which has been rumored, but what if Exxon bought ConocoPhillips [COP]? Those would be four potential surprises, none of which are in our base case.

Karim, what's on your mind?

Fawaz: To echo a lot of what has been said already, demand is still the biggest concern in the short term. In terms of something harder to visualize, the past 12 months, especially 2022, was the year of intense government intervention [in sanctioning Russian oil and more]. To some extent, that slowed down over the past four months. There's a sense of complacency that we went through this wave of intervention and now we're normalizing. But the reality is, you can end up in a pre-interventionist environment pretty quickly if markets break out of this quasi-comfortable range. If prices move closer to $100 a barrel, does the U.S. administration change the way it is thinking about these things -- and vice versa on the downside? OPEC members have significant modernization needs, so how that friction emerges in the next two years is also going to be interesting.

I was just in New York and Boston, talking with a lot of our investor clients. This is the first time in 10 years that I didn't get a single question about U.S. shale. That is interesting to me. To some extent, U.S. exploration-and-production companies have succeeded in making themselves boring and stopped being disrupters, which they have wanted to do for a number of years. But this system is still dynamic. This year is difficult, but over the next couple of years, you might start to see more comfort with potentially moving from 0% to 5% [production growth] to 3% to 7% production growth. You might also see consolidation in the hands of producers that are more comfortable growing than the current operators. We're one U.S. supply overshoot away from supply abundance getting back in the narrative. It's a low-likelihood outcome, but if the U.S. overshoots one more time, it's difficult to see how this sector gets on a sustainably more bullish trajectory in the medium term.

That's a lot to think about. Thank you, all. B

The worldwide echo of the racist aggression suffered by Vinicius has generated a stain on Spanish soccer, a shadow that LaLiga is trying to shake off but that the RFEF recognizes. "We have a problem of racism," admitted president Luis Rubiales. These episodes of structural racism that have reached the courts in recent years are joined by investigations into alleged referee corruption stemming from the so-called Negreira Case. All this, a year before the 211 federations that make up FIFA decide where the 2030 World Cup will be held, for which Spain is bidding together with Portugal and Morocco.

"We don't know if racism is going to have an influence because there is still a year to go, but it would be a good thing if drastic measures were taken to tackle the slightest doubt. It is not a good message that everything ends up shelved. This is the ninth time it has happened with Vinicius and it has had a global significance". The person speaking is Miguel Angel Lopez, the former RFEF executive who was director of the Iberian Bid formed by Spain and Portugal that opted for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, beaten by Russia and Qatar. He knows what the ins and outs of FIFA are like and what interests prevail. Any excuse, coupled with the economic power of another bid, can undermine the Spanish bid. "I don't think Infantino is interested in singling out Spain, a very important federation, and even less so after Qatar. I think everything will calm down when the competition is over in a week's time, but I don't remember a campaign like this one. They must prepare themselves," he said.

This is not the first time that a shadow of suspicion has kept Spain out of the race to host international sporting events. It happened twice with Madrid's Olympic bid. For the 2016 Games, a question from Alberto de Monaco about security in the capital sowed doubt. It was 2005 and ETA had not yet laid down its weapons. In 2013, when it was opting for the 2020 Games, it was doping and the international fallout from 'Operation Puerto'. Both were a burden that was not even perceived.

"We did not see it as a disadvantage. No one from the IOC told us that," recalls Theresa Zabell, director of international relations for the bid. "They were two issues that existed. No one was denying them. Maybe the problem was communication management. We were not prepared to bring out the positive side of 40 years of experience in the fight against terrorism or anti-doping operations to keep sport clean," she admits. His experience says that these shadows "have to be stopped at source". "All levels have to take a stand and send a strong message of zero tolerance. The most important thing is the image of fair play on and off the field," says the former Olympic sailing champion.

Campaigns and sanctionsWhile the police identify and arrest three of the aggressors, and the Public Prosecutor's Office continues its investigations, the RFEF and LaLiga have set aside their confrontations to unite in a campaign under the slogan 'Together against racism'. In addition, the Federation has also launched'Racists, out of soccer', which was launched yesterday at the Copa del Reina. An initiative with a dual target audience: on the one hand, people who engage in racist and xenophobic behavior and, on the other hand, the soccer fans as a whole, so that, if they see them, they can denounce them, "so that together we can put an end to a problem that damages the image of Spanish soccer as a whole", says the RFEF.

Will it be enough? "No one can know if they will bring it up, but some rival can use it as foul play," warns Juan de Dios Crespo, a lawyer specializing in sports law. "What you have to do is be prepared. Have all the reports ready, because rival bids also have racism or human rights problems." Arabia, along with Egypt and perhaps Greece, will head one bid; the other, Uruguay with Argentina. "Uruguay had Luis Suarez suspended for eight matches for racist insults to Evra."

Crespo does not believe that the repercussions of what happened will influence the votes in the election of the host country. Spain has the support of Morocco, and the Alawite kingdom has that of the African Confederation (CAF). "No one is free from a racist episode and that does not mean that a whole stadium or a whole country is racist. What is done is to sanction," he insists.

This specialist believes that there are tools in Spanish sports legislation to do so. Mestalla is facing a closure, at least partial, of the stand where the events occurred and the VAR referee who showed the images that led to the expulsion of Vinicius, Iglesias Villanueva, will not referee again this season nor will his contract be extended.

"The closure is in line with UEFA measures and would be a proportionate sanction. And as for the referee, it is a strong message. If more needs to be done? Laws and regulations would have to be changed. And that's politics," the lawyer concludes.

THE OLIGARCH'S PASSPORT; IN 2015, PORTUGAL OPENED ITS DOORS TO FOREIGNERS WHOSE JEWISH ANCESTORS HAD BEEN EXPELLED DURING THE INQUISITION.

As Rabbi Daniel Litvak stepped out of the cab at the airport in Porto one Thursday morning last March, a cluster of plainclothes Portuguese cops swarmed him. His son, Malkiel, watched in shock as more than a dozen men halted traffic, seized bags, and bundled his father into a vehicle, speeding off without explanation. To Malkiel, it looked like a kidnapping.

The officers were from a branch of the federal Polícia Judiciária. They drove Litvak three hours south to their headquarters in Lisbon, where they booked him, photographed him, and placed him in a cell for the night, according to Litvak, alongside a man from Pakistan arrested for attempted murder and a local arrested for armed theft. The eventual charges against Litvak included document forgery, influence peddling, and money laundering—and he was arrested, he was told, based on an anonymous tip that he was trying to leave the country.

The next morning, the Lisbon team expanded their dragnet in Porto, searching several properties, including the city's Kadoorie Mekor Haim Synagogue, named for a wealthy Jewish dynasty whose family members had helped fund the synagogue's completion in the late 1930s, just before thousands of Jewish refugees began passing through neutral Portugal as they fled Nazi persecution. After the war, the country's fascist dictatorship supported a policy known as “Re-Christianization” that left little room for minority religions. The building fell into disrepair until this century, when legislation to offer citizenship to those with Portuguese Jewish descent accelerated the revival of the Jewish community. The Comunidade Israelita do Porto is now 1,000 strong, with a headquarters and a small museum sitting catty-corner to the synagogue's front gate.

Yoel Zekri, a young French Israeli dentist who moved to the city in 2015, was in the synagogue that Friday, working to prepare the Shabbat meal. Around 9 a.m. several dozen officers showed up, some of them armed, and some of them climbed the stairs to the entrance. Zekri's polite greeting—“Oui, bonjour?”—was rebuffed with a stern response—“Search warrant”—as officers barged in brandishing a clutch of documents. (The Portuguese attorney general's office, which oversees the judicial police, told Vanity Fair that magistrates are not allowed to comment on specific cases, and the investigations “are covered by legal secrecy.”)

Zekri spotted a highly recognizable name on the papers mentioned as probable cause, though the person had never set foot in the synagogue. It belonged to a Jewish man who had recently been granted Portuguese citizenship: Roman Abramovich.

The day of Litvak's arrest in March 2022—14 days into Russia's war in Ukraine—Boris Johnson's government had imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on Abramovich, known as “Putin's wallet,” and his estimated $12 billion. The European Union followed suit five days later. But Abramovich was ahead of the game. In July 2020, the oligarch had certified his heritage as the descendant of Jewish people long ago expelled from Portugal; by the following April, he had consequently gained Portuguese citizenship—and thereby the possibility of lifelong residency in the European Union, as well as the ability to challenge European sanctions imposed on him. (A spokesperson for Abramovich said he did not “wish to comment” for this story.)

Abramovich, who grew up an orphan in Russia's frozen north, made the bulk of his fortune buying a state-owned energy conglomerate from the Yeltsin-era Russian state on the cheap before selling it back to a Putin-led government a decade later for more than 50 times the value of his original stake. Thrice married with seven kids, his life has been unfailingly colorful, his $350 million Boeing 787 Dreamliner the stuff of legend. But the global reaction to the war in Ukraine severely hampered his ability to flit between mega-yachts and luxurious properties like the Château de la Croë on France's Cap d'Antibes; in April 2022 French authorities froze the villa that had been home to royalty from Britain, Belgium, Italy, and Egypt, as well as Aristotle Onassis and Stavros Niarchos. Abramovich had acted as an occasional mediator between the Kremlin and Kyiv, even suffering a bout of suspected poisoning there, as The Wall Street Journal reported. At the Ukrainians' behest, the US did not sanction him, despite demands from some members of Congress.

Abramovich's unlikely citizenship from a small, sunny western European nation like Portugal had been public knowledge before Putin initiated his campaign. But the extraordinary details behind Abramovich's citizenship application and its approval by Portuguese authorities, many never previously reported, reveal unsettling truths about the allure of wealth, the promise of nationality, and the strength of nationalism. At a time of deep political agitation between Russia and the West, Abramovich's rapid procurement of European Union citizenship has caused embarrassment for authorities in Portugal, according to current and former politicians. But Litvak's story also raises serious questions about the fairness of the country's justice system and the powerful persistence of antisemitism, particularly in Europe.

Litvak, 63, grew up 9,000 miles from Abramovich, though around the same time, in Buenos Aires, his grandparents having fled Europe in the early 20th century. As a young man he had moved to Israel to finish his rabbinical studies. He began working in Porto in 2007 and has been the rabbi there ever since. His wife, Ruth, and his six children live full-time in Israel, where he had been heading before his arrest. Over the years, his role and responsibilities in Porto expanded considerably, mirroring the growth of the community he serves, in the city where his Jewish faith had—long ago—been almost entirely obliterated.

By the late 1400s, what was once a patchwork of fiefdoms across the Iberian peninsula had narrowed through centuries of conflict and compromise to just two major powers: the kingdom of Portugal and the combined kingdom of Castile and Aragon, precursor to modern Spain. In 1492, the rulers of the latter, Ferdinand and Isabella, issued an edict calling for the expulsion of their country's hundreds of thousands of Jewish residents. Many sought refuge to the west, where a Portuguese king promised them protection. But just four years later, a new king ordered an expulsion, part of a prenup with his wife, Ferdinand and Isabella's daughter. Historians say that while a small number of expulsions were carried out, King Manuel did not want successful Jewish people to abandon his economy, so he forcibly converted them to Christianity, though some maintained their faith in private, particularly in the country's more remote regions. Those families became known much later as “crypto Jews,” or by the Hebrew term Bnei Anusim (roughly “descendants of forced ones”).

ABRAMOVICH'S GLOBAL TRAVEL ON A $300 MILLION BOEING 787 DREAMLINER IS THE STUFF OF LEGEND. BUT THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE SEVERELY HAMPERED HIS ABILITY TO FLIT BETWEEN MEGA-YACHTS AND LUXURIOUS PROPERTIES.

Elsewhere over the centuries, the Roman Catholic Inquisition hunted down any conversos perceived as insincere. Porto's old walled Jewish neighborhood became known as Vitória, or Victory—alluding to Christianity's conquest of the heretical Judaic faith. Hundreds of Jewish families understandably fled elsewhere, either to more welcoming cities in Northern Europe like Antwerp and Amsterdam or to existing communities in the Ottoman Empire and North Africa. They became known as the Sephardim, after the Hebrew word for the Iberian peninsula, Sefarad.

Fast-forward five centuries or so. Successive financial crises left tiny Portugal on its knees—no longer able to exploit the wealth of former colonies, instead reliant on an almost $100 billion bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund in 2011. Desperate for foreign investment and with an aging population, politicians turned their focus to immigration policy. In 2012 the government in Lisbon introduced a program that offered residency permits to wealthy foreigners if they invested more than $600,000 in property. (More than 5,000 Chinese applicants and over 500 from the US have obtained these so-called “golden visas.”)

The head of Parliament's foreign affairs committee, José Ribeiro e Castro, envisioned a similar program that might generate not just investment but goodwill. He'd been contacted on Facebook several years earlier by a Jewish man in New York, where the oldest Sephardic community in the US had been founded in the 1650s. The man, a stranger, had asked if any statutes might offer him and his community citizenship, Ribeiro e Castro recounted in his Lisbon office. The politician consulted the law book and indeed discovered an avenue, but it was convoluted and untested.

As Spanish authorities began to develop a similar “law of return,” several Portuguese lawmakers from the Socialist Party proposed legislation. Ribeiro e Castro—a Christian Democrat—heartily endorsed the “process that honors Portugal,” as he put it in an op-ed at the time. “It was a symbolic reparation,” he said to VF, and a way to restore “the composition of the national tissue of the country.”

In early 2015 Portugal rolled out the pathway to naturalized citizenship. In short: just a clean criminal record and proof of Sephardic ancestry, which would typically require authentication by boards representing either of the country's two largest Jewish communities, in Lisbon and Porto. Only once Sephardic heritage had been certified could a person apply for citizenship.

For the volunteer board members in both communities, this represented a big responsibility. Israeli authorities had developed vast government departments over decades to determine Jewish descent, but there was no recognized legal or scientific standard for affirming specifically Sephardic ancestry as distinct from, say, Ashkenazi, Mizrahi, or Ethiopian Jewish backgrounds. Plus, the Portuguese communities were being given just months to set up their systems.

The government provided no formal estimate for the number of people worldwide who might qualify, and the new regulations were vague about the threshold to prove a person's Sephardic roots, giving community leaders significant discretion. In Lisbon, the board began hiring graduate students and PhDs to trawl through archives from the Inquisition and compare their findings with applicants' family trees. “It's the biggest history lab in Portugal, bigger than the universities,” said José Ruah, the treasurer and longtime board member of the Lisbon community, whose own family returned to Portugal from North Africa around the same time the Inquisition finally sputtered in the 1820s. In Lisbon, people requesting Sephardic certification did not need to identify as Sephardic Jews, only prove a link to family who once had been, which could take months or years.

Porto's leaders chose to interpret the new law's criteria rather differently. Applicants would have to identify as Jewish or be the child of a Jewish parent and provide an attestation from their local rabbi that they “had a tradition of belonging to a Sephardic community of Portuguese origin,” alongside evidence that might include the etymology of their surname, the use in their family of a language called Ladino (largely derived from Old Castilian Spanish and Portuguese), or other proof of direct descent. Final approval of all applicants would fall to Litvak and people working directly for him—and decisions would be made with minimal delay.

In the eyes of the state, at least publicly, neither community's approach was necessarily more correct than the other, and for the first few years not a single official raised a red flag or published any complaints. Just 466 applications were logged in 2015, the first year of the program. By 2020, though, that number hit 34,876. The Sephardim had been the world's first truly global Jewish community, ending up everywhere, from Libya to London, Hamburg to Mexico City. Folders filled with multilingual marriage certificates and photo albums flooded in from all corners.

By far the largest surviving number of Sephardim can be found in Israel. A bustling avenue to Portuguese citizenship rapidly developed there, with several corporations springing up to service the interest. “It was like a factory: 100 clerks, telephones,” recalls Leon Amiras, the vice president of the Israeli Bar Association, who was initially skeptical about having non-lawyers involved. He had personally helped a couple hundred Sephardim apply, following word-of-mouth referrals, from his office opposite the Waldorf Astoria in Jerusalem. But the more he saw of the larger operators, the more he grew to admire their seriousness and professionalism. They were, he says, “‘tak, tak, tak,’ first stage, second stage.…” He trails off to pull out his phone and show me several slick commercials produced by one such firm, called Portugalis.

Like Litvak, Amiras was born in Argentina. His grandparents had fled Turkey during an early 20th-century conflict with Greece, and he successfully gained Spanish and Portuguese citizenship thanks to Sephardic ancestors in both his parents' families. But he told me his Portuguese certification from the community in Porto required far less documentation than the endless back-and-forth with the designated Jewish community in Spain. “The difference between the Portuguese procedure and the Spanish procedure is like when you have two girlfriends,” he explained with a hint of mischief. “One says ‘I really love, love you, want to be with you.’ The other says, ‘I'm not sure if I want you, if you want to be with me, I want flowers, I want a Rolex, I want this, I want this, I want this.’”

The subsequent deluge of citizenship and passport requests—the latter as proof of the former—began to outpace Portugal's poorly staffed civil service, and delays mounted. By June 2020, foreign minister Augusto Santos Silva appeared before Parliament to ask for change. “There are an increasing number of people who come to that consulate,” he said, quoting a telegram from Portugal's ambassador to Israel, “both to prepare applications and to collect their citizen cards or passports, who manifest complete ignorance about Portugal, its culture and history, even declaring they have no intention of visiting our country.” Israeli firms, he told lawmakers, had been advertising Portuguese citizenship applications during Black Friday sales. Such “prostitution,” he called it, of the country's nationality “damaged Portugal's international reputation.” Another lawmaker proposed adding a two-year residency requirement. Various Jewish communities began to worry that the right of return wouldn't last much longer.

THE DAY LITVAK WAS ARRESTED, BORIS JOHNSON'S GOVERNMENT HAD IMPOSED A TRAVEL BAN AND ASSET FREEZE ON ABRAMOVICH—BY THEN ALREADY A PORTUGUESE CITIZEN.

On July 16, 2020, an applicant with the Hebrew name of “Nachman ben Aharon” emailed the Porto community. “Dear Community,” he wrote in English. “I am a Sephardic Jew member of Sephardic community. Rabbi Boroda interviewed me and attested my Sephardic origin. Thank you, Roman.” Attachments included a birth certificate, a PDF file entitled “Letter from the Rabbi,” copies of Russian and Israeli passports, and a Microsoft Word document entitled “Roman Abaramovich [sic] Family tree.” It included two parents, Irina and Arkadiy, born in the USSR, and four grandparents, born in the “Russian Impire [sic].” One hour and 53 minutes later someone responded, “Shalom. Approved” and requested some information be sent in a different format.

Four days later, a SWIFT payment receipt shows Abramovich instructed his bankers at UBS in Switzerland to pay a “charitable contribution” of 250 euros to the Jewish Community of Porto's account at the local subsidiary of Spanish banking giant Santander. It was the standard processing fee, which, multiplied across tens of thousands of applicants over several years, has helped Porto's Jewish community accomplish a great deal, including feature films about Judaic history in Portugal, a moving Holocaust museum, and tours for schoolchildren. A few weeks later, Abramovich supplied the reformatted information and proof of payment. He also wrote, “I plan to donate you [sic] on the permanent basis for the long term.” His application was immediately passed to the Porto community's back office. Gabriel Senderowicz, the community's current president—using the pseudonym Berel Rosenstein, as he commonly did to avoid hassle from pushier applicants, he explained to me—alerted other members of the “support committee.” He suggested the group send an email of thanks, which was duly written and dispatched. (“Those who doubt Abramovich's Sephardic origins do not know the law, do not know the case, or do not know both,” Senderowicz told VF.)

Abramovich's “Letter from the Rabbi” had been written by Alexander Boroda, the head of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia. In 2018 Boroda had officially recognized Abramovich for two decades—and half a billion dollars—of contributions to the federation. The two men have been close for many years: They were photographed enjoying lunch together at Basil Pizza & Wine Bar in Brooklyn back in 2013. Boroda wrote in the certification letter that his friend's heritage was “based on my acquaintance with Roman Abramovich testimonies and a personal interview that I conducted.” He added the billionaire “preserves Sephardic rituals, lifestyle, traditions and food customs.” When asked what food customs distinguish a Sephardic family in Russia, he told VF, speaking from a rowdy restaurant in Rome, “I don't know exactly.” Boroda added that he'd offered Sephardic assurance for “20, 30, not more” Russian Jewish people seeking Portuguese citizenship, and noted that a 23andMe test had put his own genetic heritage at 0.6 percent Spanish and Portuguese. Boroda did not mention something that Senderowicz did, however: that he sought Porto's Sephardic certification for himself, just a few months after Abramovich. When asked about this later, a representative said Boroda was on a “personal holiday” and unable to comment.

In a memorandum to the board, a member stated that the certification of Abramovich's Sephardic roots from Boroda was “reliable.” The note went on to say that though the Porto community had “always been quite averse to accepting such cases, fundamentally because of the difficulty of treatment,” Abramovich was not only deserving of a certificate thanks to his community of origin, but also because he was rich enough to buy citizenship elsewhere and was instead choosing to become part of a “small dignified country unfortunately on the brink of bankruptcy.”

In August 2020, the Porto community wrote to the prime minister's office saying that Roman Abramovich was an example of a Sephardic Portuguese Jew who would “try to mobilize to help Portugal.” By early September Abramovich was emailing a member of the Porto board that he had “heard many good things about your community from Rabbi Boroda,” adding that he planned to “become a member of your community and participate in all activities.”

On October 14, 2020, Abramovich filed his application for Portuguese citizenship at the Conservatória dos Registos Centrais in Lisbon, where it sat, unprocessed, for several months, along with thousands of others.

Whatever the motivation, Abramovich's desire for Portuguese citizenship emerged against the background of some very specific geopolitical circumstances. In early 2018, two Russian military officers posing as tourists attempted to poison a former Russian spy in the English cathedral city of Salisbury, cratering the UK government's relationship with Moscow. Abramovich—whose British investor visa was already facing scrutiny—withdrew his visa renewal request after the original expired that May. The same month, on a visit to Moscow, Litvak learned from Russia's chief rabbi, Berel Lazar, that Abramovich might have Sephardic heritage. At the end of May, Abramovich jetted to Tel Aviv after Israel confirmed his eligibility for citizenship. Almost overnight, he went from Britain's 13th wealthiest resident to Israel's richest citizen (he is now second to the late casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson's wife, Miriam). Abramovich continued to pursue residency options in Europe.

In September of that year, a court in Lausanne, Switzerland, directed the release of a police report that had blocked Abramovich's two-years-long attempt to set up residence in Verbier. Local officials had described him as “a very attractive taxpayer for the community” and approved his application, but the police ultimately decided his presence would constitute a reputational risk—and potential security risk—for Switzerland, citing 1990s-era allegations of money laundering as well as alleged ties to criminal organizations. Abramovich's Swiss lawyer issued a response insisting that “Mr. Abramovich has submitted to numerous, thorough background checks by government and business partners over the years and such unsubstantiated allegations have never been at issue.”

In February 2021, a Porto board member wrote to Maria de Lurdes Serrano, the head of the central registry office in Lisbon, requesting a “declaration of urgency” for processing Abramovich's application, invoking reasons this was in the national interest including “Portuguese Jewish diplomacy in the world,” “recovery of the national economy,” and the “prestige of Portuguese State institutions.” Nothing about the letter was illegal, nor is there any evidence of a financial quid pro quo involving the Porto community. But perhaps fearing that perception, the letter stated: “Given the brutal increase of anti-Semitism in Europe and the certainty that the following information would cause headlines and outcry against Jews, as taught by Jewish history in European territory, we ask Your Excellency to take all measures so that said information never falls into the public square.”

Within days, Lurdes Serrano wrote back, assuring that the Abramovich application would “not take more than 10 months.” She soon instructed a staff member on the fourth floor, where some Sephardic nationality applications were handled, to “place this urgent request in the process…and follow along its processing, so as not to exceed the period of 10 months.” Ten months is the statutory minimum—so her reiteration of that time frame, and the fact she copied two central registry office board members, struck at least one person with related experience as a sign that Lurdes Serrano understood her correspondence might be examined in the future. Both the country's intelligence service and the Polícia Judiciária—who are still investigating Litvak and several other members of Porto's Jewish community—confirmed in response to her that they had no opposition, “nada consta,” to Abramovich's application. Normally, clerks wait several weeks or even months for a police response; Abramovich's case was actioned within just 24 hours. A spokesperson for the Polícia Judiciária did not answer VF's questions about the timing.

Usually, as Portugal's citizenship application portal makes explicit, candidates can expect to wait 24 to 29 months, but Abramovich waited only nine weeks from the February date the Porto board flagged his application for Lurdes Serrano to the time he was granted a “naturalized citizen birth certificate” on April 30. A few weeks later, Lurdes Serrano confirmed to the board that Abramovich's citizenship had been granted: “I inform you that the respective nationality registration has already been carried out.” A rare surviving billionaire from Russia's “gangster capitalism” era who still retained a direct line to Vladimir Putin now possessed EU citizenship. Even his own local lawyer told VF she had been “surprised” at the speed. In response to questions from VF, the Portuguese government agency that oversees that central registry office said “disciplinary procedures” were ongoing.

At the end of that month, Abramovich visited Porto to watch his soccer team, Chelsea FC, clinch victory in the finals of Europe's Champions League tournament, beating Manchester City, a team owned by the brother of Abu Dhabi's ruler, who also happens to be the ruler of Dubai's son-in-law. (This was before the UK government forced him to sell the club amid war-related sanctions.) On the pitch afterward, Abramovich waved to fans, hugged players, and posed with the trophy, though he did not mention his new citizenship.

It was ultimately Alexei Navalny—the Russian opposition leader currently in a Siberian jail—who directed global attention to Abramovich's citizenship in December 2021, shortly after the Portuguese press first confirmed it. He criticized Portuguese authorities for “carrying suitcases of money” and wrote on his Twitter account that the oligarch had “finally managed to find a country where you can give some bribes and make some semi-official and official payments to end up in the EU.” Santos Silva, the Portuguese foreign minister who back in 2020 had advocated for changes to the law, pushed back against Navalny's claims in a press conference. “The idea that Portuguese public sector employees carry suitcases of money is insulting,” Santos Silva said, insisting the allegation was “not true. And as we all know, when criticism has no basis, it also has no pertinence.” (VF has seen no evidence that Porto's board members or civil servants working in the Conservatória dos Registos Centrais received any payment beyond the standard processing fee.) A spokesperson clarified to VF that Santos Silva had not meant to imply that Abramovich's application procedure was legal, however; around the time of Litvak's arrest in March last year, Santos Silva asserted that action was needed to keep the law from being “manipulated”—pervertida. The Portuguese government, meanwhile, has acknowledged that Abramovich will not lose his nationality as a result of EU sanctions, nor can he be prevented from visiting Portugal (barring an extraordinary outcome from the Litvak investigation).

The day before Litvak's arrest, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa formally proposed a new set of regulations on Sephardic nationality: Applicants would have to prove inheritance of property or corporate shares in Portugal or show evidence of regular trips to Portugal throughout their lifetime to “demonstrate an effective and lasting connection.” David Mendoza, the London-based president of the Sephardic Genealogical Society, considers this an obscene undermining of the original offer; the Inquisition was efficient in its terrors. “My last living relative in Portugal was burnt alive in 1732, and they have an inventory of everything they confiscated from him,” he says. “How can we inherit property if everything was confiscated hundreds of years ago?”

Portugal has become a popular destination for a host of influential people, straining the housing market in a nation with one of Europe's lowest average incomes. Tamir Dean Pardo, the former head of Mossad, is now a citizen thanks to his Sephardic heritage. Others have found nationality through different Portuguese immigration exceptions. The Aga Khan, the 49th hereditary head of the Shia Imami Ismaili Muslims and a billionaire, was granted citizenship even more quickly than Abramovich following an urgent request from Rebelo de Sousa. Two children of former Angolan strongman José Eduardo dos Santos are Portuguese on paper. They join various international boldface names who own Portuguese real estate, though some are already European or are simply foreign investors: Designer Philippe Starck and Fiat heir Lapo Elkann have purchased luxurious homes along the coast. Elkann, who converted to his father's Judaic faith in 2009, reportedly recently played host, alongside his Portuguese wife, to Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, while Madonna has a house near Lisbon.

PORTUGAL HAD BEEN LEFT ON ITS KNEES—NO LONGER ABLE TO EXPLOIT THE WEALTH OF FORMER COLONIES, RELIANT INSTEAD ON A $100 BILLION BAILOUT.

Last September, six months after his arrest, Litvak won an appeal to lift some of the punitive measures against him: the confiscation of his passport, which rendered him unable to leave the country, and thrice weekly check-ins with the police. The judges heavily criticized the behavior of the prosecutors and law enforcement. “What amounts, who paid, when, relating to which naturalization process?” they wrote in their decision, citing a lack of evidence. “There is nothing in the file that tells us that these payments were of criminal origin.” The judges concluded with a rhetorical question: “How does one defend oneself only from generalities?” The attorney general's office said inquiries are ongoing, with “analysis of the extensive documentary compilation seized.”

In March, the Porto community board wrote a letter to Rebelo de Sousa requesting an apology for the raids and the arrest, which was forwarded to the prime minister's office; at the time of publication, there has been no response from the prime minister or president.

Litvak invited me to his home in Ashdod, Israel, where he and his wife made a simple lunch of white rice and homemade meat dumplings, followed by instant coffee. “If they think that the work wasn't right, they have the right to stop this: ‘We don't want the law, we change it.’ It's your country, do that if you want,” he told me in slightly hesitant English. He emphasized that the ultimate controversy was in the government's own hands: “We didn't give the nationality to Abramovich.”

On April 15 of this year, the Portuguese government announced plans to end the Sephardic nationality law altogether at the end of 2023. “The purpose of reparation,” the proposal declares, “is understood to have been fulfilled.”

JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: Coming up here on CNN, drone wars, Moscow hit again as Ukraine ramps up drone attacks deep inside Russia's borders.

Growing concerns for the safety of an American nurse and her baby kidnapped in Haiti, the latest victims of a surge in gang violence.

And a nuclear comeback. The first new nuclear reactor built in the U.S. in three decades goes online seven years late and $17 billion over budget.

ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with John Vause.

VAUSE: Thank you for joining us here on CNN NEWSROOM and we begin in Moscow which has been hit by another drone attack. City's mayor says a high rise building was damaged. The same building was hit just days earlier in a similar attack.

Ukraine and Russia appear to be ramping up attacks by air targeting key cities on both sides of the border. Kyiv says Moscow has carried out a new deadly strike in the hometown of the Ukrainian president. At least six people were reportedly killed, dozens were wounded when two ballistic missiles hit a school building and a residential tower. Official say a 5-year-old girl was among the dead.

Russia's Defense Minister said his country would respond to any kind of Ukrainian attacks by intensifying their strikes on Ukraine.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SERGEI SHOIGU, RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): Given the current situation, we took additional measures to improve defense against attacks from the air and sea. The intensity of strikes against Ukrainian military facilities, including those used to conduct these terrorist acts has been increased many times over.

(END VIDEO CLIP) VAUSE: The attacks in Moscow appear to be part of a bolder Ukrainian strategy to take the fight directly to Russia. CNN's Nic Robertson has our report.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice over): Russia's war in Ukraine is increasingly blowing up. In Moscow, this Ukrainian drone attack Sunday night bringing Russia's war hundreds of miles away into the heart of its own capital, shocking citizens.

LIYA, MOSCOW WITNESS (through translator): My friends and I rented an apartment to come here and unwind. And at some point, we heard an explosion, and it was like, a wave. Everyone jumped.

ROBERTSON (voice over): Attacks like this in Moscow becoming increasingly common. Last week, another Ukrainian drone hit a Ministry of Defense building, a psychological blow for a population repeatedly told by Putin's state media they are winning the so-called special military operation.

POLINA, MOSCOW RESIDENT (through translator): I was asleep and woken up by an explosion. Everything started to shake and the whole building had come down.

ROBERTSON (voice over): This weekend, Putin was keeping up the pretense everything is OK, celebrating Navy Day. But behind the scenes, his officials appear rattled by Ukraine's refusal to be beaten.

ROBERTSON: Former President Dmitry Medvedev says if Ukraine's counteroffensive is successful, Russia will use its nuclear weapons.

Meanwhile, the Kremlin is dismissing the drone strikes, and Moscow, as an act of desperation, the defense minister calling them terrorist attacks. Reality, they've got Moscow's attention.

ROBERTSON (voice over): Ukraine's president is independent hinting more of these strikes to come.

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Ukraine is getting stronger. Gradually, the war is returning to the territory of Russia, to its symbolic centers and military bases. This is an inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process.

ROBERTSON (voice over): Zelenskyy is stating what is becoming increasingly apparent. Ukraine is ramping up drone strikes inside Russia.

In recent weeks, targets just over the border in areas vital to Russia's war efforts have increased, too. The impact even breaking through on Russia's state media. What is clear, Ukraine's fight on Russian soil is having effect.

[00:05:18] Nic Robertson, CNN, London.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

VAUSE: Major General James Spider Marks he is a CNN Military Analyst and he joins us now from Washington. General, it's good to see you.

MAJ. GEN. JAMES SPIDER MARKS, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: John, thanks very much for having me.

VAUSE: Here's the threat from Russia -- former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, he posted on Telegram, just imagine that the offensive in tandem with NATO succeeded and ended up with part of our land being taken away. Then we would have to use nuclear weapons. There simply wouldn't be any other solution.

Is there a credibility issue simply because the threat is coming from Medvedev who has been a useful for Putin in the past? He says a lot of this stuff a lot of the time. And I guess, also, doesn't it reflect perhaps growing concern inside the Kremlin about Ukraine's counter offensive?

MARKS: John, I think it's both. To your first point, I don't think it's appropriate for any nation to take a nuclear threat as a Chimaera (ph), as a threat that really has no backing or legitimacy.

Look, Russia has a tremendous nuclear stockpile. Medvedev has said that he would use this before, he is the spokesman for Putin in this regard.

But I think it's important that we take this very, very seriously. And I can guarantee you that on the U.S. side, and I would hope on the other NATO partners that have nuclear weapons, that they are various -- you know, very serious about how they want to approach what their posture is relative to these threats. You can't discount them, you can't throw these threats away, you need to take them seriously, you need to make sure that you're prepared in case there is some catastrophic mistake that's going to take place.

To your second point, I think it is important to realize that what Ukraine is doing in Moscow right now may have an effect on Russian capabilities and command and control capabilities.

But also I think, at this point, it's a fool's errand. Ukraine doesn't need to be making strikes into Moscow. The results are, I would suggest, are probably sketchy at this point. And if it is demonstrating that Ukraine has the ability to do this, fine, now is not the time to do it.

Look, the only reason to conduct an event like this, strikes like this is to try to further weaken Putin's position, the best way to do that is if you can -- Ukraine can continue to achieve levels of success tactically on the battlefield, and start sending young men home in body bags, that will increase the amount of pressure that Putin feels.

VAUSE: What was interesting though in his threat, Medvedev also added this, our enemies should pray to our fighters that they do not allow the world to go up in nuclear flames.

So, there are nuclear weapons, and then there's short range tactical nuclear weapons. And that reference seems to be, you know, talking about a full nuclear strike with ICBMs and the whole works, that brought this reaction from us Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. To my Russian friends who talked about using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, you need to understand that would be an attack on NATO itself, given Ukraine's proximity to NATO territory.

And I guess in many ways, Putin is a lot of things out there, a lot of speculation about his mental health or everything else, but he's not suicidal, right?

So, any kind of nuclear strike in that regard would be the end of Putin and his regime.

MARKS: It's fair to say that, absolutely. And look, again, let's be honest with each other, calling a nuke a tactical nuke vise a strategic nuke, frankly, is a distinction without a difference. They are still in the nuclear bucket. And a strike with a tactical nuke in the -- in the vicinity of NATO nations is a strike against NATO.

And also, let's bear in mind, Putin is -- many would call him irrational, I would say he's incredibly irrational. He's very much a survivor. But he has not released nukes. He's letting others do the talking for him. And he has resisted the call to do that.

But I think it's important that we kind of put all this together, a nuke strike would be devastating for Russia, it would be devastating for Putin, it would mark the absolute end of the Russian Federation, as we know it right now. And Putin would be gone.

VAUSE: And with that in mind, the U.S. President was asked about Russia using nukes in Ukraine while he was in Helsinki last month. This is Joe Biden's answer, here he is.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't think there's any real prospect. You never know, of Putin using nuclear weapons. Not only has the West but China and the rest of the world has said that's -- don't go there. Don't go there.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

[00:10:02]

VAUSE: I'm wondering how closely should we -- should we watch China's reaction to any kind of nuclear threat from Moscow as one of the best ways -- best ways to gauge how serious or credible that threat might be?

MARKS: Yes, that's a great question. But again, I go back to the point, nukes have not been used. Putin has not chosen to use nukes. I can assume that self-control on his part may be hard to believe. But also there's external control that's come from Xi Jinping.

I guarantee you, Russia is acting like a vassal state of China right now. So, I would imagine what we're not seeing is as a result of Xi Jinping's influence.

VAUSE: Major General James Spider Marks, thank you, sir, for being with us. We really appreciate your time.

MARKS: Thank you, John.

VAUSE: Less than a week after overthrowing Niger's democratically elected president, six senior officials from his party had been arrested by the military. The coup leaders are also accusing France of plotting military action to free President Mohamed Bazoum, who is apparently being held inside the presidential compound.

CNN's Larry Madowo has the latest.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: France is denying that it's planning a military intervention to free ousted President Mohamed Bazoum. In fact, the French foreign minister saying it's absolutely not true that it's considered that, that response is necessary because the military (PH) in Niger has claimed that France has been meeting with former officials, ousted officials to try and get military and political authorizations to carry out military strikes around the Presidential Palace to free Bazoum.

To understand exactly what's going on, it's important to pay attention to what two key Western allies are saying about the situation, the French and the Americans. The U.S. State Department has still not classified this as a coup, a technical definition that will require it to stop military support, as well as aid.

In fact, a U.S. State Department official telling CNN that they still consider this a domestic dispute between the presidential guard and President Mohamed Bazoum, so some Western allies essentially believe that there's a path to restore President Mohamed Bazoum to the presidency.

But for ordinary people, they worry about the likely effect of the sanctions announced by the Economic Community of West African States for a country that's already had been through so much turmoil.

BOUNTY AMADOU DIALLO, RETIRED TEACHER (through translator): I think the sanctions were initially taken in the heat of the moment, and then apparently dictated by outside powers, because Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea were in the same basket as us before, but we didn't sanction them as heavily. They say they want to set an example. They want to make an example.

MADOWO: The clearest path out of this crisis in Asia appears to be the mediation efforts by the transitional president of neighboring Chad. If President Deby cannot get general tyranny and Mohamed Bazoum to agree on some path out of this, that it means ECOWAS has no option but to use force like they threatened.

And on Tuesday, they would have five days after that one week deadline to have some kind of military intervention.

Larry Madowo, CNN, Nairobi.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

VAUSE: ISIS has claimed responsibility for Sunday's deadly suicide bombing in Pakistan, saying the attack was part of its ongoing conflict against democracy which it views as hostile to the principles of Islam.

Police say the attacker detonated explosives at a political rally near Afghanistan's border. They also say a dozen children were among the 54 people killed.

The U.S. is cautiously working to secure the release of an American nurse and her child abducted in Haiti. According to the United Nations, authorities have already registered more than a thousand kidnappings in Haiti this year, and the country's rapid gang violence is only getting worse. CNN's Jason Carroll has our report.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ALIX DORSAINVIL, AMERICAN VOLUNTEER KIDNAPPED IN HAITI: My name is Alex. I'm a nurse from New Hampshire.

JASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Alex Dorsainvil's family and friends continue to pray for the safe return of her and her child. According to the faith based humanitarian aid group El Roi Haiti, the two were taken by captors from the organization's campus located near Port-au-Prince. That's where she had been working as a school nurse and her husband Sandro Dorsainvil is the director.

DORSAINVIL: Sandro invited me to come to the school to do some nursing for some of the kids who said that was a big need that they had.

CARROLL (voice over): In a brief statement, El Roi Haiti said the two were kidnapped Thursday saying in part, Alex has worked tirelessly as our school and community nurse to bring relief to those who are suffering.

Outpouring of support also coming from the school where she studied nursing.

ANTOINETTE HAYS, PRESIDENT, REGIS COLLEGE: Alex is very compassionate and cared very much for people who had great need. She was definitely a very special young woman.

Dorsainvil and her child taken it in the midst of ongoing gang violence, which has overtaken much of the country and forced thousands of Haitians to flee their homes.

The Biden administration says they are closely monitoring the situation. JOHN KIRBY, PRESS SECRETARY, PENTAGON: We don't want to do anything and say anything that would put their safe return in jeopardy.

[00:15:03]

CARROLL (voice over): The U.S. last week ordered the departure of all non-emergency personnel from Haiti and told Americans to leave as soon as possible while trying to marshal international support.

ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We've been very focused on trying to put in place what's necessary for a multinational force, including finding a lead nation to take this on.

CARROLL (voice over): But the delay in creating that so called multinational force could make matters worse.

GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE, FOUNDER AND EDITOR, THE HAITIAN TIMES: The gang leaders, they feel that the days are numbered. I think now is the most dangerous time to be in Haiti because anything can happen to you.

CARROLL (voice over): And its innocent Haitians and people like Dorsainvil dedicated to helping them getting caught in the crossfire.

DORSAINVIL: Haitians are such a resilient people, they're full of joy and life and love and I'm so blessed to be able to know so many amazing Haitians.

Jason Carroll, CNN, Middleton, New Hampshire.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

VAUSE: An American woman has been arrested in the Bahamas and charged with conspiring to kill her husband, just months after the couple filed for divorce.

Lindsay Shiver is accused of plotting with the two locals to kill Robert Shiver on July 16th while the couple was visiting the islands, the three defendants are to remain in custody until a court hearing is set in October.

Still to come here on CNN, mounting legal troubles and legal fees for Donald Trump as the former president remains defiant on the campaign trail.

And the Women's World Cup the defending champions get ready for their next showdown, a live preview from Sydney, that's up next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

VAUSE: The U.S. will face off against Portugal in the Women's World Cup in just a few hours. All eyes are on the defending champions.

CNN's Angus Watson live from Sydney with a look at the next round of matches. So, can they make it a three peat, are they are they on their way? ANGUS WATSON, CNN PRODUCER: John, one of the top teams in the competition, of course, Team USA, ready to face off against Portugal, they must win or at least draw to make sure that they get their place in the next round facing off perhaps Sweden or Italy there and the eyes of the world will be on the U.S. women's national team as they always are the best in the world at this stage as you say, double World Cup champions going for the three peat.

But as star player Megan Rapinoe said in a press conference just now, if you're the best, all you're looking to do is get better.

John, up against them though will be the Matildas, hopefully at some stage in the later rounds of this competition if you're an Australian fan here where I am at the Sydney fan zone, thousands of fans turned out to watch the Matildas in a do or die clash against Canada, the eyes of this nation right on them.

[00:20:02]

But if there was any pressure on the stars of the Australian side, it didn't show, four nil in the end against Canada. The Matildas soaked up the pressure early on, came out physical, won 50 battles in the midfield and made it count on the score sheet.

So, tonight, USA versus Portugal. We also have England versus China to see if the English can top their group coming into the next round. They might face Australia if they finished second to Denmark, John.

VAUSE: Angus, thank you. Angus Watson there in Sydney with all the very latest.

The grand jury investigating Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election is expected to meet in Washington in the hours ahead.

Meanwhile, the U.S. co-defendant in the classified documents case against the former president made his first appearance in Florida. CNN's Jessica Schneider has details.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JOHN IRVING, REPRESENTING TRUMP'S CO-DEFENDANT: The Justice Department has unfortunately decided to bring these charges against Mr. De Oliveira. And now, it's time for them to put their money where their mouth is.

JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Carlos De Oliveira leaving the federal courthouse in Miami, Monday, escorted business his lawyer and federal agents. A 20-year employee at Mar-a- Lago, De Oliveira walked out of court on $100,000 bond after being charged along with former President Trump and Trump's close aide, Walt Nauta, with attempting to delete security footage from Mar-a-Lago after it was subpoenaed by a federal grand jury.

De Oliveira allegedly telling the director of I.T. at Mar- a-Lago, the boss, an apparent reference to Donald Trump, wanted to delete the server where security footage was stored.

CNN also reporting that another Mar-a-Lago employee received a target letter from federal prosecutors. Yuscil Taveras oversees the property's surveillance cameras and has met with investigators in recent weeks. It's unclear if he is cooperating. So far, he is not facing charges, but at latest some of the allegations in the indictment were based on information he provided.

DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: They're not indicting me. They're indicting you. I just happen to be standing in their way. That's all it is.

SCHNEIDER (voice over): Trump defiant as he continued campaigning over the weekend, even as he was charged with additional crimes in the special counsel's classified documents case.

TRUMP: If I weren't running, I would have nobody coming after me. Or if I was losing by a lot, I would have nobody coming after me.

SCHNEIDER (voice over): Plus, all signs point to another indictment soon out of D.C.'s federal court.

REPORTER: Can you tell us whether you expect to have an indictment this week?

SCHNEIDER (voice over): Likely against Trump and his allies for their efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

FANI WILLIS, FULTON COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: We're ready to go.

SCHNEIDER (voice over): And in Georgia, an indictment watch kicks into full gear. Fulton County's district attorney likely a week or two away from presenting her case to a grand jury and announcing whether Trump will be charged for trying to overturn the 2020 election results in that state. Ramped-up security measures are already in place around the local courthouse and a county judge just rejected efforts by Trump's legal team to toss evidence in that criminal investigation and to disqualify the district attorney.

WILLIS: Some people may not be happy with the decisions that I was making. And sometimes people, when they're unhappy, they act in a way that could create harm. The work is accomplished. We've been working for 2.5 years.

SCHNEIDER: And Donald Trump's legal bills are mounting so much so that sources have told our Kristen Holmes that his team is now creating a legal defense fund to help offset some of the costs.

Up to this point, it's been Trump's political action committee Save America that has been fronting those costs, already spending more than $40 million just this year to pay with the legal fees for Trump and many of his associates.

Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington.

(END VIDEOTAPE) VAUSE: Still to come on CNN, China prepares for a six typhoon this year to make landfall but there's not a certainty there's an unpredictable storm path here, we'll tell you the very latest in a moment.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[00:26:10]

VAUSE: Welcome back, I'm John Vause. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.

As the remnants of Typhoon Doksuri weaken over China, hundreds of thousands of people now waiting to return to their homes. Torrential rains caused flooding across the country, forcing many to evacuate. Heavy downpours are expected to continue through Tuesday, increasing concerns about dangerous flooding as well as landslides.

CNN's Meteorologist Chad Myers has the very latest.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Well, the Western Tropics obviously heating up now, the waters warm, the storms are here, we had Doksuri making all of that rain into parts of China now dying off quite a bit, but it's still going to rain for a while. It's just spreading out now, moving away from where the main flooding was.

And obviously, the next storm system here, 215 kilometers per hour already. And it still could grow just a little bit.

But here are the numbers from the last storm from Doksuri, over 300 millimeters of rainfall, causing rivers to swell here, cars were floated by the waves, some pictures there we have there.

This is the area now that we're going to see the heavy rainfall with the remnants of Doksuri over the next couple of days where Beijing well down to the south away from the bulls eye there of the heaviest rainfall at least spreading out that rain a little bit.

But here is typhoon Khanun. This is the storm that is really concerning for places like Okinawa, north of the Philippines, east of Taipei, and also east of China.

Because the storm is moving to the west now will likely not continue, either stall, stop or possibly turn a little bit to the right and spend days over the islands here, very close to Okinawa and the like.

Why don't we know where it's going to go because this is what the model runs look like. Some of them take it to the south, some of them all the way to the North. And some just really just stop it there in the middle.

So, possibly day after day of wind, waves and of course, the possibility of very, very heavy rainfall. If this thing does stop, and then just keeps raining for days or hours, we are going to see some significant flash flooding even in these low lying islands. So, rain after rain after rain could be in some spots in the ocean could be a half a meter to a meter of rainfall. That's not out of the question, if this thing's just sits there and stalls and rains and rains and rains.

So yes, it's heating up. The water is warm, and the storms are in play.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

VAUSE: Thank you, Chad. Well, as the world faces a worsening climate crisis created by the rapid burning of fossil fuels. The U.K. has announced plans to drill for more oil and gas.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has committed to grant hundreds of new licenses for companies to expand drilling operations in the North Sea. He says it will provide the U.K. with its own domestically sourced energy as the country transitions to a net zero carbon emissions goal.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

RISHI SUNAK, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: 25 percent of our energy will come from oil and gas even in 2050. Far better than we get that from here at home. Better for the economy, better for our energy security, better for jobs and better for climate emissions.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VAUSE: But environmental activists say this plan will take a wrecking ball to Britain's climate change commitments.

Matthew Bunn is a professor and nuclear energy expert at Harvard University's Belfer Center. He joins me now from Watertown in Massachusetts.

Professor, thank you for being with us.

MATTHEW BUNN, PROFESSOR AND NUCLEAR ENERGY EXPERT, HARVARD UNIVERSITY'S BELFER CENTER: Well, thanks for having me.

VAUSE: OK, so one of the big concerns of renewable energy right now is capacity and during the transition from fossil fuels, nuclear power is seen as an option to kind of make up the difference.

And so, with that in mind, the first new nuclear reactor built in the U.S. is now online here in Georgia, operated by the Southern Company. And here's part of that announcement.

Today is a historic day for the state of Georgia, Southern Company and the entire energy sector. The project shows just how new nuclear can and will play a critical role in achieving a clean energy future for the United States.

[00:30:00] We'll look at the costs of nuclear power in a moment, but you know, yes, nuclear energy is carbon free, but spent fuel from a nuclear reactor remains radioactive for tens of thousands of years and using nuclear energy to lower carbon emissions, in the past, it's been said it's a bit like, you know, smoking to lose weight. Yes, it works, but it comes with a whole lot of other problems.

Well, I do think this is a historic day to have this new nuclear reactor connected, but as you say, there are many issues that nuclear energy has to address in order to grow at the immense scale that any energy source has to get to, to really be an important part of mitigating the terrible threat of climate change.

This particular reactor, unfortunately, has taken twice as long to build is expected, twice as much money, more than twice as much money as expected. And so the market is not that interested in the United States in building a whole lot more of this type of reactor.

VAUSE: As you mention, this nuclear power plant here in Georgia, seven years longer than the initial plan. It came in $17 billion over budget.

When we have -- when we compare this to wind farms, or a renewable energy source, where the World Nuclear Association puts the cost of building an advanced nuclear reactor north of $5,000 for every kilowatt of capacity, and according to the World Energy Information Administration, it says a new wind farm costs about a quarter of that.

So why not invest the billions of dollars that may go into nuclear into renewable, safe forms of clean energy, get more bang for your buck, and have a hole lot clear -- have true clean energy. Not -- no radioactive waste that can last for hundreds of thousands of years?

MATTHEW BUNN, PROFESSOR OF THE PRACTICE OF ENERGY, HARVARD'S BELFER CENTER: Well, to be fair, the great advantage of nuclear energy is that it is not intermittent, unlike wind and solar. You need something when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow.

Now that something doesn't necessarily have to be nuclear. It could be geothermal. It could be fossil fuels with carbon capture. It could be a variety of things.

Batteries are extremely helpful for shifting from a sunny afternoon to energy you want to use in the evening, but they're not as good yet for being able to shift from July to January, when there's a lot less sun.

So having some kind of backup to intermittent energy sources is probably important for the overall energy system in the future as we move towards zero carbon.

VAUSE: And just to bring this back to the decision by the U.K. to max out its fossil fuel reserves, widely condemned by concentration groups and other groups like OxFam, "Extracting more fossil fuels from the North Sea will send a wrecking ball through the U.K.'s climate commitment, at a time when we should be investing in just transition to a low carbon economy and our own abundant renewables." That was part of a statement they released.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pushed back with this statement: "There are those who would rather oil and gas come from hostile states than from supplies we have here at home."

Yes, that seems to be a reference to Russia, obviously, which has weaponized its supplies of oil and gas. Doesn't true energy independence come from ending an addiction to fossil fuels and moving towards renewables, just ending renewables completely.

BUNN: Well, unfortunately, the world is not in a position to end use of fossil feels completely any time soon. The world remains extremely dependent on coal, oil, natural gas, especially in the transportation sector, but also in electricity and industry.

There's really an immense amount of work to do to get to that net-zero carbon that we all want to shoot for to limit the damage of climate change.

One of the things that's driving interest in reactors like the one that was connected in Georgia today is the desire to get of dependence on Russian national natural gas with the war in Ukraine.

So while there isn't much of a market for this reactor design in the United States, both Ukraine and Poland have expressed interest in building reactors like the one in Georgia. Whether they'll find the money to pay for it, especially Ukraine, is an interesting question.

VAUSE: Professor Bunn, thank you, sir, for being with us. We really appreciate your time.

BUNN: All right. Thank you.

VAUSE: UNESCO has recommended listing Venice as a world heritage site in danger because of deterioration and damage to building structures due to tourists and climate change.

Meantime, the agency has recommended that Australia's Great Barrier Reef not be placed on a list of places considered in danger but warned that the world's biggest coral reef ecosystem remained under serious threat, and urgent and sustained action is needed to save it.

Well, can A.I., artificial intelligence, and socialism play together nicely in the sand pit? The Chinese government seems to think so. So ahead, the new rules for regulating a key aspect of artificial intelligence.

(MUSIC: THEME SONG FOR "PEE-WEE'S PLAYHOUSE") (END VIDEO CLIP)

VAUSE: That's Pee-Wee Herman, brought to life by actor and comedian Paul Reubens, who died on Sunday.

Reubens was best known for the Emmy Award-winning "Pee-Wee's Playhouse" series, which spawned films, streaming specials, even a Broadway show.

But back in 2002, the actor was arrested in an adult theater in Florida and charged with obscenity. A much more serious charge was dropped during a plea deal.

In recent years, he fought a private battle with cancer and left a message to be released after his death, which was posted to Instagram. It reads, "Please accept my apology for not going public with what I've been facing the last six years. I've loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you."

Paul Reubens was 70 years old.

Hollywood is also mourning Angus Cloud, a rising young actor best known for his breakthrough role in the HBO drama "Euphoria."

He played a sweet-natured drug dealer named Fezco and became a fan favorite. Cloud also had a few other projects in the works.

No cause of death has been released, but his family says he lost his father recently and struggled intensely.

Angus Cloud was 25 years old.

China has become one of the first countries to build some guardrails for the technology that powers popular artificial intelligence services.

China's top Internet watchdog recently unveiled new guidelines to generative A.I. that will take effect in about two weeks. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout has details now, reporting in from Hong Kong.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Meet Xi Giojiang (ph), a virtual idol, powered by artificial intelligence to sell burgers in China.

McDonald's hired GiaGia (ph) to interact with Chinese customers.

The U.S. may be curbing A.I. ship exports to China, but the nation is fast becoming an A.I. powerhouse. They country's home to top tech firms, leading the A.I. charge, like Alibaba, Huawei, Tencent and Baidu, creator of Xi Giojiang (ph), boasts that its chatbot Ernie has beaten OpenAI's ChatGPT on several metrics.

At the state-backed world A.I. conference in July, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk praised Chinese A.I. prowess. ELON MUSK, ENTREPRENEUR: China will have very strong A.I. capability is my prediction.

STOUT (voice-over): China has become one of the first countries in the world to regulate the technology that powers popular services like ChatGPT.

In July it unveiled interim rules to manage generative A.I., saying it needs to be aligned with the core values of socialism.

[00:40:02]

ANGELA ZHANG, CHINESE LAW PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG: The Chinese government is trying to ensure that the use and application of A.I. will be aligned with its own set of moral principles that underscores its political and social stability.

The government not only placed the burden on the service providers but also on the users of A.I. services.

STOUT: In January, China's new rules against deep-fake technologies came into effect. Chinese authorities have detained people for allegedly using generative A.I. to commit fried and create fake news.

STOUT: And while China is moving fast to regulate the industry, some critics warn that it may not be equipped to avoid an A.I. disaster.

BILL DREXEL, ASSOCIATE FELLOW FOR TECHNOLOGY & NATIONAL SECURITY PROGRAM, CNAS: Most societies kind of learn from disasters, but the PRC has a kind of propaganda machine that makes it hard to do that, where there's a sort of disaster amnesia. There's kind of a chronic culture of crisis mismanagement in authoritarian regimes generally, and China is no exception.

STOUT (voice-over): Drexel cites China's zero-COVID policy as a recent example of crisis mismanagement.

But the danger posed by A.I. is not limited to one country. Top technologists the world over, including China, have signed this petition to warn of the risk of human extinction from A.I.

SAM ALTMAN, CEO, OPENAI: As these systems get very, very powerful, that does require special concern. And it has global impact, so it also requires global cooperation.

STOUT (voice-over): China's new A.I. rules have a provision to encourage participation and global standard setting.

ZHANG: They are very keen to take part in shaping global recognition of A.I.

STOUT (voice-over): For now, Beijing is steering its own A.I. future with a heavy hand. To encourage Chinese tech success and ensure that artificial intelligence will not undermine the state.

Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)

VAUSE: Well I guess that didn't last too long. The huge flashing "X" has now been removed from the building formally known as Twitter's headquarters.

The signage is part of Elon Musk's rebranding of the micro-blogging site.

But on Friday, building inspectors in San Francisco issued the company a violation notice for putting to sign up without permit after receiving at least two dozen complaints.

Now X will have to pay fees for the permits it did not get.

Tiago Tomás assumes favoritism in qualifying for Euro'2025: "There's no need to be afraid of this protagonism"

Portugal are the favorites in Group G to qualify for the 2025 UEFA European Under-21 Championship and "it will be very difficult" for Belarus to stop a Portugal team at their "best level", Tiago Tomás said on Wednesday."In either game we'll start as favorites given our quality as a team, but there's no need to be afraid of taking the lead. We know that we're going to have the ball for the most part in the games and we have to find our strategies and weapons with the ball to score our goals and show our quality," said the player, before training at the training camp in Arcos de Valdevez, at a press conference ahead of Friday's game against Belarus in Barcelos.

About a month ago, Portugal beat the same opponents in Armenia (due to a UEFA sanction for Russia's invasion of Ukraine), and when asked if the fans could expect another defeat, Tiago Tomás noted that it was important to "think about winning first".

"It's obvious that if we can win by two we're not going to win by one, or if we can win by three we're not going to win by two, but it's only in the course of the game that we'll be able to look more at that aspect," he said.

However, for Tiago Tomás, Portugal must "respect their opponents, as always".

"We had an easy game in theory because we won 5-0, but we got an early goal which may have helped, and they probably don't have the same approach to that game either. We have to think about winning first and then scoring as many goals as possible," he said.

But more than the opposition, Portugal must focus on themselves: "We know that if we're at our best it will be very difficult for them and there's no hiding that. It's more about our attitude and the way we approach the game" than the way Belarus play.

Tiago Tomás stressed the players' desire to win every game and have an "immaculate group stage, but every game is a game".

"We can't be thinking about the other games, but about the next one, and the most important thing would be to get through," he said.

The Sporting-trained forward, who plays for German side Wolfsburg, was a substitute in both games (he scored a goal against Andorra) and, like everyone else, has the ambition to "be part of the starting eleven, but it's up to the coach to choose" and for the players to "do their best every time they play and in every training session".

In the Bundesliga, Tiago Tomás has played more on one of the wings and in the national team on the attacking axis, and the player noted that the different positions he plays "have to do with the way each coach looks at" his qualities.

"I can adapt to any position up front, as long as I'm in it, it doesn't matter where, but helping the team. But really, 'mister' Rui Jorge sees me more as a winger," he said.

After the 3-0 win over Andorra (at home) and the 5-0 win over Belarus (away) in the opening two games of this qualifying phase in September, the player believes that the team will improve.

"In the first game we didn't have as much quality as we should have, which is normal because it was our first game together, we'd been training together for three or four days, with a lot of new faces, and a period of adaptation is normal. I think we'll improve with time, without a doubt, because we have players with quality and game ideas that will help us demonstrate those qualities," he said.

Portugal lead Group G with six points from two games, eight goals scored and zero conceded, Greece are second with four points and Belarus are fifth with three points, but with five games already played.

The national under-21 team host their Belarusian counterparts from 5.30pm at the Estádio Cidade de Barcelos, and four days later (October 17) they face Greece in Guimarães.

Cristiano Ronaldo faces $1 billion lawsuit for advertising cryptocurrencies

Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, Al-Nassr Saudi footballer, will face a class action lawsuit in excess of $1 billion in the US by a group of investors in the company Binance, the world's largest digital currency exchange platform and of which the sportsman was the face of the company.

The Madeira-born striker launched a year ago in partnership with Binance a collection of NFT's (a type of digital asset that can be bought and sold) under the CR7 brand. Ronaldo stated at the time that this was a way of giving back to his fans "all the years of support". "We are going to change the world of NFT and take soccer to the next level," he assured. However, those assets, which were priced at $77 a year ago, are now worth just one.

The plaintiffs argue that Ronaldo should have made public the compensation he received from Binance, as celebrities must abide by the laws of the country to advertise them. For example, they must disclose who and how much they are paid to promote investment in these assets, as they can be considered securities. The Portuguese did not do so, but the plaintiffs point out that this alliance of Binance and Ronaldo led them to delve into the world of cryptocurrencies and with it they lost a lot of money. To this end, they argue that Binance's internet searches following the deal shot up 500%.

"When celebrities advertise investment opportunities, including cryptoassets, investors should make sure the investments are suitable for them, and they should know why celebrities are promoting them," Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC), the U.S. financial overseer, has said in this regard.

The complaint was filed in a Florida court and accuses the Portuguese footballer of having "promoted, assisted and/or participated in the purchase and sale of unregistered securities in coordination with Binance". It is also noted that the footballer should have been aware that "Binance was selling crypto-securities", as he has "investment experience and extensive resources to obtain advisors".

This lawsuit comes just a week after the US judiciary claimed more than $4 billion from Binance for money laundering, after being investigated for its involvement in evading US sanctions against Iran and Russia. It is also seeking to determine whether the company enabled transactions that helped fund Hamas. Changpeng Zhao, the company's founder, resigned last week after pleading guilty to violating the US Bank Secrecy Act and accepting the sanction.

Cashing Out by Neill Lochery review — Europe’s Nazi art scam

Portugal wasn’t the only country to make a fortune by trafficking gold and art looted by Hitler’s forces, including masterpieces by Goya, Cézanne and Van Gogh

The Second World War was a catastrophe for every belligerent nation except the United States. Some of those countries that contrived to stay out of it, however, became rich. The story of Switzerland is well known. Many millions in Jewish victims’ and Nazi mass-murderers’ cash wound up in the cantons, protected by banking secrecy law and the absence of shame from Swiss DNA.

Swedish business did pretty well too. In 1941 the Stockholm government bent its neutrality sufficiently to allow a German infantry division to transit through their country to the Russian front. Spain’s ministers and generals were bribed by Churchill to keep their country out of the conflict. Incidentally, this permitted its bloodstained dictator Francisco Franco to die in his bed in 1975.

Much less well known, however, is the tale recounted here by Neill Lochery, of neighbouring Portugal. Its dictator António Salazar played a wily wartime hand, making himself useful to all parties, and enriching some of his countrymen in the process.

In 1953 Portugal acquitted itself from Allied moral indictments by signing an agreement to return just four tons of Nazi bullion that the country had received in return for massive shipments of wolfram, which facilitated Hitler’s armaments manufacture. But postwar estimates suggest that this represented only 1 per cent of the swastika-stamped gold bars transported to Lisbon’s banks.

Moreover, according to the author, beyond government-to-government transactions Portugal became the main clearing-house for massive consignments of cash, gold, jewellery and works of art dispatched by Nazis to safe havens across the Atlantic. The American-inspired 1944-46 Operation Safehaven sought to halt the traffic and restore property to Germany’s victims or their surviving relatives. Yet it proved extraordinarily difficult to trace the provenance of loot even after the war ended. Secret auctions had been held, sometimes in the homes of rich Portuguese, after which paintings and sculptures disappeared into houses in which some artefacts remain to this day.

The looted and mostly unrecovered masterpieces allegedly include works by Goya, Cranach, Rubens, Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Cézanne, Titian and El Greco. Many of them, including paintings owned by the Rothschilds, had been paid for by dealers, albeit at knockdown prices.

One dealer, Arturo Reiss, reported being approached in a Madrid hotel in December 1944 by a stranger who offered to sell him some fabulous work for $10,000. Reiss, suspecting that it was stolen, reported this to the British embassy, but the Ministry of Economic Warfare in London said that it lacked resources to investigate individual cases, which Lochery calls “a costly oversight”.

Postwar Portugal provided some prominent Nazis with documents enabling them either to enjoy comfortable local retirements, or decamp to Argentina or Brazil. Whenever the Americans or British charged Salazar with dirty dealing, he reminded them of their debt to him for allowing them to run a vital Atlantic airbase on the Portuguese Azores. In the new Cold War, like Franco, he also made himself seem indispensable to the West.

It was not that the Allies failed to take art thefts seriously. They sought to reclaim works for their cultural value and in justice to the dispossessed. On May 5, 1945 the US Foreign Economic Administration produced a preliminary report entitled

Looted Art in Occupied Countries, Neutral Countries and Latin America

. The director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York suggested at least $2 billion’s worth had been stolen.

According to the author, however, in the Americans’ triumphalism about the achievements of their “Monuments Men” in Germany, they overlooked far larger quantities of art and specie that had long since left the defeated Reich. Lochery has specialist knowledge of Portugal and Brazil, and describes the former as “the country that has said the least” about the booty it secured from the Nazis, “and got away with the most”.

This book certainly adds to historians’ understanding of Portugal’s role in the war, but it is weakened by its focus on Salazar’s nation. There is no discussion of Switzerland, probably the most important conduit for ill-gotten gains, albeit a much-chronicled story.

Lochery says much about Hitler’s former intelligence chief Walter Schellenberg and his interrogations by the Allies. But his story is familiar, and relevant to the flight of loot through Portugal and Spain only because Schellenberg had extensive dealings with their politicians. Seeking to brand himself as the acceptable face of the SS, in 1945 he was shocked, on entering the British Latchmere House interrogation centre, to find himself treated as a common war criminal rather than an honoured guest.

In all conflicts, some bystanders profit mightily from providing goods and services to belligerents. During the First World War, Norway’s shipping fleets and Holland’s role as a port of access for Germany proved immensely serviceable to both nations. Japan’s post-Second World War recovery advanced by giant strides thanks to the Korean War. Thailand prospered from the long Indochina struggles.

It is repugnant to be reminded that brokers and parasites made fortunes by clinging to Nazi coat-tails, but so they did. Before Pearl Harbor, Churchill raged about the vast sums that the US extracted from the European democracies, albeit without doing many favours to Hitler. Neutrality is often good business, as today’s Gulf states can testify, as they profit from the Ukraine conflict through sanction-busting to Russia.
