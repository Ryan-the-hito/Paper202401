Verona Murphy claims Wexford County Council Officials tried to influence SIPO vote in Dáil Debate

2022 Independent Newspapers Ireland Ltd
INDEPENDENT TD Verona Murphy has called for sanctions against two Fianna Fáil councillors over their handling of a Standards In Public Office (SIPO) investigation and report into Wexford County Council Chief Executive Tom Enright.

Speaking in Dáil Eireann today (Wednesday) Deputy Murphy accused current Cathaoirleach of Wexford County Council Cllr Barbara Anne Murphy and previous Cathaoirleach Cllr Michael Sheehan of rushing through a vote on the report, which found that Mr Enright had threatened to pull advertising from South East Radio over grievances relating to the coverage he and the council were receiving on the station.

Sensationally, Deputy Murphy also alleged that senior officials within Wexford County Council had canvassed elected members of the council to vote in Mr Enright's favour with an implication that not doing so would impact upon their ability to get constituency work done.

“In Wexford in early January following a complaint in 2019, SIPO issued one of the most damning reports in its history,” Deputy Murphy said, during Leader’s Questions. “It exposed the most inappropriate behaviour by Chief Executive Tom Enright and then Cathaoirleach, Fianna Fáil councillor Michael Sheehan. Mr Enright was found to have used the weight of the public purse in an attempt to influence the editorial output of South East Radio, something you might see in Mother Russia.

“Within two days of issuing the report, the Fianna Fáil Chair of the council, Cllr Barbara Anne Murphy, called a meeting to immediately push through a vote supporting the Chief Executive, ignoring the findings of the SIPO report, ignoring her own legal advice and established custom and practice for dealing with serious disciplinary matters for a Chief Executive. It was an action which she herself should be sanctioned for.

"The vote was controlled and ran through by the two main parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael councillors. They made a laughing stock of SIPO by effectively giving them the two fingers. This 376 page report had taken SIPO two years to compile.”

At this point, Deputy Murphy turned her attention to other officials within Wexford County Council, making some sensational claims.

“Other senior officials, including the County Secretary and Directors of Services made contact with councillors to impress upon them the importance of supporting the Chief Executive in a vote," she said. “Implicit in that contact was that the potholes and footpaths in their areas would not be attended to if they did not support their man. An action that should be investigated in its own right, and that they should also be sanctioned for.

“As one Junior Official in Wexford County Council put it to me, these votes will cost the council money.”

Addressing Taoiseach Micheál Martin across the Dáil Chamber, Deputy Murphy continued: “Taoiseach, do you and your party recognise the importance of SIPO and its findings as a mechanism for retaining public confidence in the civil and public service? I think you do. You mentioned corruption earlier. In that circumstance, what sanctions do you propose for councillors Sheehan and Murphy for aiding and abetting the Chief Executive in this debacle?”

Some of the content of Deputy Murphy’s address had Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl moving uneasily in his seat.

“We’re travelling into previously unvisited territory," he said. “I perfectly accept the validity of exploring issues around a SIPO report. But I would have concerns about mentioning people that haven’t been mentioned here before and are not here to defend themselves in any way.”

Deputy Murphy replied: “It’s all on the public record having been reported in the local newspaper Ceann Comhairle.”

He directed to proceed, but urged all involved in the discussion to "tread carefully”.

In his response, Taoiseach Micheál Martin first pointed out that  “there was always a tradition in this house that we don’t make allegations against people who are not here to defend themselves or to respond.”

He then launched into an impassioned speech about the importance of public servants across the country, urging Deputy Murphy not to “tar everybody with one issue or one particular incident or one particular action in one local authority”.

Getting somewhat to the nub of the issue, the Taoiseach said: 

“In respect of local democracy, we delegate authority to local councils. They may not always decide on policies or issues that we’re happy with or that we agree with. We may disagree with actions taken. My understanding is that that following the first council meeting, that councils are obliged under statute to convene after a SIPO report, it was adjourned for a second meeting to take place. I can check that, but that’s my understanding. After that first meeting, it would have been adjourned for a subsequent meeting. 

“SIPO reports should be taken very seriously, of course. (...) As far as I’m concerned, there has to be a very clear demarcation line between governments, be it local or national, and media. That the independence of media is equally a central tenet of our democracy and should always be respected and protected.”

Deputy Murphy was nowhere near satisfied with the Taoiseach's response.

“I notice Deputy Browne gave you the information on the meeting, which is correct,” she said. “The meeting convened and another one took place within seven days. Even when a councillor, an independent councillor, voiced his opinion that he hadn't had sufficient time to consider the 376 page report, they continued with the vote, against legal advice that they could be subject to judicial review.

“Taoiseach, I would say without a shadow of a doubt you are a decent person and you do have public interest at heart, even though you’re well able to spin. I’m not going to stand here and be lectured that there’s no accountability at local level. The reality is that if we don't have accountability at local level, we can't have accountability anywhere else. 

“These are your party members. These are questionable actions from Directors of Services and the County Secretary in which case they actually garnered a vote. That has to be addressed. This whole debacle has served no purpose other than to emasculate SIPO. Can you tell me what the purpose of SIPO is if this is not going to be addressed? To me Ceann Comhairle, it’s a complete waste of the public’s money. Something that took two years for SIPO to compile took less than seven days for Wexford County Council, under the Chair of Fianna Fáil to actually do nothing about.”

Growing frustrated, the Taoiseach replied: "There are many parties on that council. I would make the point that the SIPO report will have impact. I'd put it to you that it's already having an impact. When a report like that is published, it has wider implications and ramifications for other Chief Executives across other local authorities too.”

“Not if there’s no sanction Taoiseach," Deputy Murphy shot back.

“Yes, it does,” Mr Martin said. “I would not agree with you. Not everyone is going to behave the same way one council does or the way one Chief Executive Officer may do. Others will take note of what was laid down by SIPO here and the findings of SIPO in relation to this particular situation. That’s my view.”

Deputy Murphy, still unsatisfied said: “The message is that we’ll all do what we like. It made no impact. He got a round of applause.”

Addressing the contents of the SIPO report specifically, the Taoiseach said: “There cannot be any attempt to influence the content of any local radio discussion, debate or its treatment of coverage of any issue. Even if you have advertisements that may emanate from the council, that can never be used for that purpose by anybody. I’m very clear about that.”

“But nothing was done," Deputy Murphy concluded before the Ceann Comhairle moved things on.

‘Non-negotiable’: Putin’s blunt new message

President Vladimir Putin has appeared in a video address after ordering Russian forces into two rebels regions in eastern Ukraine, sparking fears of all-out war.

Around 10,000 Russian troops have entered the breakaway territories of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine – known collectively as the Donbas region — while Russian authorities have denied Ukraine’s right to sovereignty.

In the video, Putin says he is ready for “diplomatic solutions” surrounding the crisis but Russia’s interests are “non-negotiable”.

The EU has called for sanctions to be extended to Belarus, after new satellite images revealed new Russian military build-up on its soil, just 40km north of the Ukrainian border.

The Ukrainian government made a number of announcements on Wednesday, including the drafting of army reservists aged 18-60.

Ukrainian civilians have also been given the right to carry firearms and defend themselves, after the country‘s parliament voted in favour of the emergency measure.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison addressed the nation to reveal Australia’s response to the crisis, including a string of fresh sanctions.

Vladimir Putin appears in new message

President Putin has appeared in a video message to celebrate a Russian public holiday — Fatherland Day.

In a long message to Russians, where he bragged, “we have weapons that are second to none in the world and they are operational”, Mr Putin said the Kremlin is open to “honest dialogue” but warned “the interests of Russia are non-negotiable”.

“Comrade officers,” he said.

“Ensuring that our country can defend itself remains a primary responsibility of government, and the Armed Forces serve as a reliable guarantee of our national security, the peaceful and orderly lives of our people and Russia’s stable and steady development.

“We can see the difficult international situation and the threats posed by current challenges, such as the erosion of the arms control system and NATO’s military activities.

“And yet, Russia’s appeals to build a system of equal and indivisible security that would reliably defend all countries, remain unanswered.

“Our country is always open to a direct and honest dialogue and ready to search for diplomatic solutions to the most complicated issues.

“But I want to repeat that Russia’s interests and the security of our people are an indisputable priority. So, we will continue to strengthen and modernise our Army and Navy, striving to increase their effectiveness, so they are fitted out with the most cutting-edge equipment.

“We will continue to develop promising weapon systems, including hypersonic weapons and those based on new physical principles, and expand the use of advanced digital technology and elements of artificial intelligence. Complexes like these are weapons of the future, which can boost the potential of our Armed Forces several-fold.

“As Supreme Commander-in-Chief, I have confidence in you, Russian soldiers and officers, in your high professionalism, bravery and reliability, that you will guard the peace of our people, and stand up for the national interests of our great country.

“I wish you good health and every success in your service. I want to extend the best wishes to your families and friends.

“Again, my sincere greetings to you on this holiday.”

Ukraine to announce state to emergency

Ukraine is set to annouce a state of emergy as it urged its three million citizens living in Russia to leave the country immediately.

The state of emergency is expected to last approximately 30 days after Ukraine’s security council approved the plan in response to Russia’s advance.

The move must be formally approved by parliament before coming into effect.

Russia began evacuating diplomatic staff from Ukraine, its embassy in Kyiv told AFP, a day after lawmakers in Moscow granted President Vladimir Putin to use force abroad.

Asked if the evacuation had begun, the embassy’s spokesman Denis Golenko told AFP by phone: “Yes.”

Moscow’s foreign ministry announced Tuesday it would evacuate diplomats from the country soon.

Russian ambassador hauled into Canberra meeting

Russia’s ambassador to Australia has been hauled to Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and TradeAustralia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade office.

Alexey Pavlovsky was pictured entering the Canberra building and was inside speaking with the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Defence and Trade Kathryn Campbell for approximately half an hour as Russian troops entered breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.

He avoided the media as he left but the Prime Minister hasn’t ruled out kicking Mr Pavlovsky out of the country.

“We haven’t taken that step,” Mr Morrison said.

“Other countries, and I’ve discussed this with other leaders, they haven’t taken those decisions as yet. But we will see where this proceeds.”

New photos reveal scale of Russia’s ‘invasion’ plans

Newly-released satellite pictures have revealed the extent of Russia’s planned “invasion” of Ukraine.

One of the images, from Maxar Technologies, show a deployment of forces and vehicles in Belarus, north of the border with Ukraine.

Another shows masses of troops in Pochep, western Russia, while a third reveals a new deployment, material support and troops gathered near Belgorod, Russia.

EU’s foreign affairs chief Josep Borrel called for sanctions to be extended to Belarus if an attack is launched by Russian troops from its soil.

“I want to repeat once again that any further aggression against Ukraine will have a strong answer from the European Union,” Mr Borrell said in Brussels following a 10-hour meeting with 27 foreign ministers.

Lithuania’s foreign affairs minister Gabrielius Landsbergis claimed some of the Belarusian armed forces were taking orders from Russia

“Belarusian troops are receiving their commands now more and more from the Russian political decision-makers … and that means that there’s low, very low, levels of independence in the Belarusian army,” he said.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has previously said it is “clear whose side Belarus will be on” if war breaks out in the region.

Scott Morrison speaks with Ukrainian PM

Scott Morrison and Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal spoke by phone this evening to discuss the developing situation, after the Prime Minister announced sanctions against Russia.

“Prime Minister Morrison reaffirmed Australia’s unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and denounced Russia’s aggressive behaviour towards Ukraine as unacceptable, unprovoked and unwarranted,” a spokesman said.

“The Prime Minister informed Prime Minister Shmyhal of Australia’s immediate action to sanction Russian individuals, organisations and banks as part of an international effort to impose a sharp cost on Russia for its actions against Ukraine.

“The Prime Minister affirmed Australia’s preparedness to do more, working with our partners, and in response to Ukraine’s needs.”

Australian sanctions revealed

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has confirmed there will be travel bans and financial sanctions against eight individuals linked to Russia’s national security council, with restrictions also placed on the transport, energy, telecommunications and oil gas and mineral reserves industries in the rebel regions.

He added sanctions would also be rolled out against Russian banks as part of a “first tranche” of sanctions, and said Australia’s response was designed to be “in lock-step” with the US.

The sanctions will include “travel bans and targeted financial sanctions” to “ensure we can target those … who are aiding and abetting this invasion”.

He said Russia’s acts had “no validity under international law” and that “we won’t hesitate to take further action”.

“It’s included to capture persons and entities of what is termed ‘strategic and economic significance to Russia’ and so that gives us a broad coverage to ensure that we can target those who are particularly involved in these actions and who are aiding and abetting this invasion.”

He said Australia had been stepping up its preparedness for potential cyber attacks

Mr Morrison confirmed that more than 400 Ukrainians have so far applied for temporary asylum in Australia, and that their applications would move to the “top of the pile”.

Opposition Labor Anthony Albanese offered bipartisan support for the sanctions on Russian, saying “Australians stand as one”.

Full-scale invasion ‘in 24 hours’: PM

Mr Morrison has confirmed that while the invasion of Ukraine had already begun, a full-scale invasion would occur within the next “24 hours”.

“The invasion of Ukraine has effectively already begun,’’ he said.

“As President Biden has also remarked, the invasion is unjustified. It’s unwarranted. It’s unprovoked. and it’s unacceptable.”

He added that while the invasion would ramp up within hours, “there are even reports already of shelling and things of that nature, which could indicate that it has already begun”.

But Mr Morrison stressed that: “Australians always stand up to bullies and we will be standing up to Russia, along with all of our partners … and all of those who believe that it’s absolutely unacceptable that Russia could invade its neighbour and seek to extract some concessions or advantage out of threats of terrible violence upon its neighbour.”

He added that “there must be consequences” for Russia’s behaviour, accusing Russian authorities of acting like “bullies and thugs”.

UK sanctions designed to ‘inflict pain’ on Russia

UK foreign secretary Liz Truss has endorsed her government’s sanctions against Russia, warning the “tepid response” is the “toughest sanctions regimen we have ever put in place” against the nation.

When asked if Russian political donors to the UK would be included in the sanctions, Mrs Truss said “nothing is off the table in terms of who we‘re targeting”.

She said the UK’s initial response was to “inflict pain” on Russia as it advances into Ukraine, warning more action will be taken if President Vladimir Putin persists.

She warned it was “highly likely” Putin will ”follow through on his plan for full-scale invasion”.

“We have not yet seen a full-scale invasion but we are very clear that if President Putin escalates, we the international community will escalate our sanctions,” she said.

‘One last chance’: Russia’s grim threat

Vladimir Putin brutally mocked his own spy chief, urging the senior official to “speak plainly” during a televised meeting on Monday.

The clash came as Mr Putin appeared to grow frustrated by Director of Foreign Intelligence Sergey Naryshkin’s failure to adequately support Russia’s move to recognise Ukraine’s pro-Russian breakaway regions.

But while much of the attention so far has been on Putin’s humiliation of Mr Naryshkin, one of his comments have revealed Russia’s grim threat to the West before an “invasion” of Ukraine.

“With the suggestion of Nikolai Platonovich, that we could give our, how to say it, Western partners, one last chance,” Mr Naryshkin said.

“Presenting them with the choice, in the shortest time frame, to force Kyiv to choose peace and implement the Minsk agreements

“In the worst case, we must make the decision that we are discussing today.”

“What does it mean, ‘in the worst case’? Are you suggesting we start negotiations?” Mr Putin fired back.

“Or to recognise sovereignty?”

Mr Naryshkin stuttered as he tried to respond, prompting Mr Putin to demand he “speak, speak, speak plainly!”

“I support the proposal about the entry of the Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples’ Republics into the Russian Federation,” Mr Naryshkin replied.

“We’re not talking about that,” Mr Putin shot back. “We’re not discussing that. We’re talking about recognising their independence or not.”

“Yes,” Mr Naryshkin eventually confirmed.

“I support their proposal for independence.”

Fears for Australia after new sanctions announced

Concerns are growing that Australia could face Russian cyber attacks in response to new sanctions imposed as a result of the Ukraine crisis.

Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews warned that the nation’s “critical infrastructure” could be a target.

“We are concerned about protecting Australia’s interests and we are concerned about the potential for a cyber attack on our critical infrastructure,” she said.

“Now, that doesn’t mean we are going to go lightly in our response to Russia because their behaviour needs to be called out.”

It’s expected that PM Scott Morrison will announce additional financial sanctions in a 12.45pm address following today’s National Security Committee meeting.

We’ll bring you all the updates here.

Russia’s new threat as ‘invasion’ begins

Any hopes of avoiding war in Europe are fading fast as Russia vows it won’t stop the “invasion” of Ukraine, denying the neighbouring country‘s right to exist.

The provocative warning comes amid a huge language shift among world leaders, who now confirm the situation in Ukraine is an invasion and that the threat of all-out war is rising fast.

Around 10,000 troops and tanks and equipment have already moved into the two pro-Russian rebel Ukrainian territories of Luhansk and Donetsk after Mr Putin yesterday recognised them as separate entities.

Russia’s parliament voted to allow the use of armed forces outside Russia while President Putin declared he wanted to see “demilitarisation” in Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced that Russia now recognised the breakaway regions in borders which existed when they declared their independence back in 2014, including parts of eastern Ukraine on the other side of the so-called “contact line” between the two nations.

NED-5555-Putins-Terminator-tanks

Mr Putin also said Russia recognised Donetsk and Luhansk “within borders outlined in their constitutions”, while Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia did not recognise its democratic neighbour’s right to sovereignty in what has been seen as a major hint that war was looming.

Mr Lavrov justified his comments by arguing that sovereignty was only the right of nations that represented their entire populations, alleging Kyiv had failed ethnic Russians.

“Nobody can assert that the Ukrainian regimen, starting with the state coup of 2014, represents all the people who live on the territory of the Ukrainian state,” he said.

The language used by Mr Putin and Mr Lavrov have been seen as confirmation Moscow would not back down in its “invasion” of Ukraine.

Ukraine’s reservists called in

Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced he has called up army reservists to assist as the situation with Russia escalates.

“There is no need for general mobilisation today. We need to promptly replenish the Ukrainian army and other military formations,” he said.

“As the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, I issued a decree on the conscription of reservists during a special period.

“We must increase the readiness of the Ukrainian army for all possible changes in the operational situation.”

Ukraine’s desperate plan to defeat Russia

Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has revealed Ukraine’s two plans in the fight to protect its territory from Russian invasion.

“We have two plans,” Mr Kuleba said in today’s press conference.

“Plan A is to utilise every tool of diplomacy to deter Russia and prevent further escalation. “And if that fails, Plan B is to fight for every inch of our land, and every city and every village.

“Then, to fight until we win, of course.”

UN slams Russia

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has fronted the press in New York in light of the Ukraine situation, slamming Russia’s provocative decision to recognise the rebel regions.

“Let me be clear. The decision of the Russian Federation to recognise the so-called independence of certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions is a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine,” he said.

Mr Guterres also lashed Russia’s claim troops were in the regions for \"peacekeeping” purposes.

“When troops of one country enter the territory of another country without its consent, they are not impartial peacekeepers,” he said.

“They are not peacekeepers at all.”

World on ‘edge of the largest catastrophe since World War II’.

Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has also held a joint press conference with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, slamming the “unprovoked and unjustified war on another sovereign state in Europe which Russia now intensifies”.

“We all are at a critical juncture for the security of Europe as well as international peace and security more broadly,” he said.

“Russian aggression has brought the world to the edge of the largest catastrophe since World War II.

“Yesterday, President Putin moved to recognise two pieces of Ukrainian land as independent entities.

“Ukraine does not and will never recognise this absurdity, neither will the world recognise it.”

Mr Kuleba also had some strong words for those who hesitated to describe the crisis as an invasion.

“There’s no such thing as a minor, middle or major invasion. Invasion is an invasion,” Mr Kuleba said.

Expert says Russian sanctions doomed to fail

Hugh White, a professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University, told ABC News Breakfast on Wednesday that sanctions imposed against Russia would be all but useless.

“When a country as powerful as Russia, and it does remain a powerful country militarily, decides to move to armed force, really only armed force can respond and I think the fact is that Putin is now asking the rest of the world to choose between a Ukraine which is allowed to join NATO on the one hand, what the West wants, or a Ukraine which is steadily dismantled by Putin as he increasingly puts military pressure on it,” he said.

“What I think what we have seen today is quite possibly just the first step of a broader serving of incursions in the country.

“We’re brought face-to-face, if you like, with the reality that the rules-based order we all hoped to see emerge in the world after the Cold War, really does still find itself subject to the harsh realities of power and in Ukraine, in eastern Europe, the harsh reality of power goes Putin’s way.”

Ukraine shelled 80 times in 24 hours

Ukraine’s Defence Ministry has claimed Ukrainian territories were shelled a staggering 80 times in just 24 hours from the breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.

In a statement, the ministry confirmed 58 of those incidents were from weapons which are specifically banned under the Minsk agreements – a ceasefire pact hashed out in 2014 and 2015.

However, Mr Putin has stated that the Minsk accord “no longer exists”.

At least one fatality has been recorded in Ukraine so far, as well as a handful of injuries.

She has also called for all remaining Australians in Ukraine – believed to be around 100 – to leave immediately.

Biden’s sanctions revealed

US President Joe Biden spoke earlier, describing the crisis as “the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine”.

He also announced a slew of severe new sanctions against Russia.

“We’re implementing full blocking sanctions on two large Russian financial institutions: VEB and their military bank,” he said.

“We’re implementing comprehensive sanctions on Russia’s sovereign debt. That means we’ve cut off Russia’s government from Western financing. It can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or European markets either.

“We’ll also impose sanctions on Russia’s elites and their family members. They share in the corrupt gains of the Kremlin policies and should share in the pain as well.

“We’ve worked with Germany to ensure that Nord Stream 2 will not … move forward.”

Mr Biden said if Moscow “continues its aggression” there could be tougher sanctions to come.

Russia has ‘now undeniably moved against Ukraine’: Biden

US President Joe Biden has condemned Vladimir Putin and announced a slew of sanctions in a fiery address this morning.

A clearly angry Mr Biden stated that Moscow had “now undeniably moved against Ukraine” after Mr Putin “bizarrely asserted that these (two breakaway) regions are no longer part of Ukraine and their sovereign territory”.

“To put it simply, Russia just announced that it is carving out a big chunk of Ukraine,” he said.

“Last night, Putin authorised Russian forces to deploy into this region, today he asserted these regions are actually extending deeper than the two areas he recognised.

“He is setting up a rationale to take more territory by force in my view … he’s setting up a rationale to go much further. This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine as he indicated.”

Mr Biden said tough sanctions would be imposed “far beyond the steps we and our allies and partners implemented in 2014”.

They will include severe economic measures, which will target Russia’s financial institutions as well as members of Mr Putin’s inner posse.

“If Russia goes further with this invasion, we stand prepared to go further with sanctions,” he said.

“Who in the Lord’s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belonged to his neighbours?

“This is a flagrant violation of international law.”

Russia’s move described as an ‘invasion’

US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin described Russia’s military intervention as an “invasion”.

Mr Austin said the “latest invasion” of Ukraine was “threatening the peace and security and prosperity of Ukraine, and of the transatlantic community,” and that the US would impose additional “severe economic costs as events dictate.”

Mr Biden’s deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told CNN, “an invasion is an invasion, and that is what is underway.”

“Russia has been invading Ukraine since 2014 … I am calling it an invasion.”

Italy warns of growing risk of "large-scale Russian military operation in Ukraine."

The Italian Foreign Minister Giorgio Di Mario launched on Wednesday the alarm of a growing risk of failure of the efforts

in favor of a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine, by informing the Parliament that "the margins are narrowing day by day" to achieve a dialogue initiative that avoids a war.The dramatic tone

of the Foreign Minister's information stemmed from the latest press conference of Russian leader Vladimir Putin , who extended the claims on the self-proclaimed proclaimed pro-Russian republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, which began to be occupied since early Monday morning by Moscow's troops, to the whole Donbass region, which remains largely in the hands of the Ukrainian armed forces.Di Maio recalled that Putin added in his claims the recognition by the U.S. and Europe of the illegal annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea to Russia in 2014.

"We condemn Moscow's decision to send troops to the territory of the two separatist republics," justifying them as "a peacekeeping contingent."

Di Maio recalled on the floor of the Italian Senate that in the Russian siege of Ukraine the current contingent has been reinforced to a size of 170-190 thousand troops.

Call for dialogue"Despite the seriousness of the moment we want to concentrate on diplomatic initiatives that can avoid a war," he said.

While the Chancellor was speaking in the Italian Parliament it became known that Ukraine launched the order of general mobilization

of all its citizens between 18 and 60 years old.The purpose of the Kiev government is to increase by 200 thousand soldiers the armed forces to face the Russians.

"We have ratified Italy's support for the integrity and full sovereignty of Ukraine on its internationally recognized borders and launched an appeal to the parties in cause to return to the negotiating table," Di Maio said.

"In this situation that can change rapidly it is important to maintain coordination between the partners of the European Union and with NATO allies," which is the Western military alliance led by the United States with the main European countries plus Canada.

The crisis is hitting Italy hard because of the immediate consequences it may have on the national economy

.The Covid pandemic caused in 2020 a fall of about 9% of the economy, which recovered well to 6.5% last year. But the consequences are very serious because of the impressive rebound in the prices of energy and raw materials, such as agricultural products.

The explosive rise in gas and electricity prices, which exceed 50% and promise further increases, has forced the government to implement aid programs for industries and consumers, with subsidies in addition to those aimed at the recovery of economic activity due to the pandemic.

Russia's gasThe worst source of the crisis is energy supply. Italy imports more than 40% of its gas consumption from Russia, which in turn buys billions of euros worth of industrial products.

Following Tuesday's news of Germany's decision not to put the major Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia into operation as a first sanction for Moscow's decision to occupy an area of Ukrainian territory in the southeast of that country, the Italians now face the dilemma of what their contribution should be from sanctions against Putin's Russia.

Speaking before Parliament to report on the crisis, Chancellor Di Maio said that diplomatic initiatives were on hold. He was referring to the announcement of Prime Minister Mario Draghi 's trip to Moscow, agreed with Putin, but without a precise date.

Draghi, who received the request of Ukrainian President Volodimyr Selensky, said a few days ago that he hoped to obtain a summit meeting of the Ukrainian leader with Putin in his management in Moscow, but the Russian attack has made the management obsolete.

Between Russia and Italy there is a long tradition of good diplomatic and economic relations, which the crisis puts to the test.

Prime Minister Draghi said Italy fully condemned the Russian attack on Ukraine and proposed to urgently favor a diplomatic solution.

He also approved of the sanctions, but slipped in the suggestion that they would not be applied in the field of energy supplies

. Italy not only buys so much gas from Russia, but also supplies itself with a lot of oil.Although there is a growing conviction that Putin has accumulated huge foreign currency reserves that will be necessary if the economic sanctions are consolidated, in addition to those in force since 2014 as a sanction for the annexation of the Crimean peninsula to Russia, some Italian analysts stress the limits of Moscow's economic resources, which maintains a high level of 63% of exports in energy products.

Italy has a powerful economy with a gross domestic product (GDP) that last year reached 1.6 trillion euros. Russia is less than 1.3 trillion and competes with Brazil for the status of eleventh world power.

It is far behind the two largest countries: the United States, with 19 trillion (billion) euros, and China, with 12 trillion in national wealth in 2021.

At the European level, the big four are Germany, with 3.5 trillion, Great Britain (2.6 trillion), France (2.3 trillion) and Italy 1.6 trillion euros per year of Gross Domestic Product.

In theory, if the crisis leads to a sort of economic war

supported by sanctions against Russia as an alternative to an outright military confrontation, Moscow's relative weakness vis-à-vis the impressive Western bloc appears decisive.Military superpowerBut Russia, the world's largest country with 17 million square kilometers of territory, is also a great military superpower, second only to the United States, with its enormous nuclear arsenal renewed

with brand new hypersonic weapons that dramatically shorten the times.This fact explains Russia's repeated willingness to use even force - and this is the case of the crisis with Ukraine - to prevent the West from adding former communist countries to the NATO military alliance, which have the most modern atomic weapons just a few minutes away from their territory.

Putin argues that this problem must be considered and solved now to create a new security balance. This is the deep reason for the attack on Ukraine, carefully planned by a military general staff that today counts for a lot.

Its leader, considered a strategic genius, is General Vasily Gerasimov, also Russian Deputy Defense Minister, whose ideas are supported by the military commanders who lead an armed forces restructured by Vladimir Putin in ten years to implement these purposes that now challenge Western power.

For this reason, Italy has limited room for maneuver. Putin himself is conditioned in his decision to rebuild the empire. In 1991 there was "the worst geopolitical hecatomb" of the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

So wrote the Russian leader, who has vowed to fight the Western siege to prevent the rebirth of that lost greatness.

It will be difficult to stop such nationalist impetus with economic sanctions programs, however important they may be.

The deployment of 200,000 troops in the siege to "normalize" the rebellious Ukraine by any means represents the largest military mobilization in Europe since World War II. The stakes of Putin, General Gerasimov and theirs are too high. The hope of a withdrawal under the threat of sanctions looks vain. The worst is yet to come.

With the potential of a long and bloody war, risking the lives of millions of people, she appeared more concerned about missing out on her trip. Seeking sympathy for her situation, Ms Behar also complained the COVID-19 pandemic had also stopped her from enjoying a holiday in Europe.

Speaking on The View, Ms Behar said: “I’m scared for what is going to happen in Western Europe.

“You know, you plan a trip, you wanna go there, I wanted to go to Italy for four years.

“I haven’t been able to make it because of the pandemic, and now this.”

The statement by Ms Behar received a damming string of replies when the post was streamed on Twitter.

Ninja Captioner said: “Behind every war, behind all the innocent civilians killed, there's a rich white woman in an uninvolved country complaining about how she's the real victim.”

JohnnyTheBoy also said: “What is it with the people on this show being so disconnected from reality.”

In a much harsher reply, JoeyBoatWater said: “Why the f* does anyone watch this f***g show!

“It's baffling to me.

“They are all self-absorbed and completely disconnected from reality.”

In a jibe at woke culture, Samantha said: “Can we use cancel culture to cancel her, please and thanks?”

Thinking of the people in Ukraine during these challenging times, Sammy Austin said: “I'm sure all those in Ukraine and others affected by this inexcusable violence are heartbroken Joy might not get a holiday this year!

“Wtf is wrong with some ppl?”

Global condemnation has poured in against Mr Putin, with western nations imposing tough economic sanctions on Russia.

However, punitive measures have stopped short of being imposed directly on Mr Putin.

Calls for Russia to be removed from the SWIFT international banking system have been so far resisted by the European Union, but remain an option according to the White House.

Energy sanctions are a useful weapon, but we will need to plan ahead to use the power of oil

Who said this? “Sanctions are in the long run very effective, but most sanctions are slow of action. You have in oil a sanction which would be comparatively quick.” Not, as you might think, some sharp-witted analyst or hawkish politician on the best method to stop Russian aggression in eastern Europe. It was, in fact,

Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/history-should-be-kinder-to-neville-chamberlain-tpf852vqh]

best remembered for his “peace for our time” speech in 1938 after returning from negotiations with Adolf Hitler. There was, of course, no peace.

Chamberlain made the remarks about sanctions and the power of oil three years earlier, when he was chancellor. They were his verdict on one of the first attempts to stop aggression through co-ordinated international sanctions. The League of Nations, a between-wars version of the United Nations, tried to stop Italy’s invasion of Ethiopa with sanctions that look remarkably like the measures being adopted

to try to stop Russia[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russia-ukraine-invasion-jmk0vm8gg]

. The league insisted that members stop selling arms to Italy and facilitating its raising of loans in international money markets and put a limited ban on imports. It didn’t work. The sanctions lasted not much more than six months; there was squabbling between Britain and France over how much power to give to the league; and, in any event, the United States was not a member.

There was discussion of an oil embargo, an issue that sharply divided opinion. It was never adopted. Chamberlain, however, clearly thought that it was a weapon that would bring results.

There is a lively debate among historians about the ramifications of the league’s failure. Some believe that it emboldened Hitler. If the oil option had been taken and Italy stopped in its tracks, events might, perhaps, have turned out differently.

There are many differences between then and now. It is interesting reading some of the 1935 parliamentary debates about the league’s sanctions and seeing MPs worrying about what curbing a western power’s imperial ambitions might mean for Britain’s own far-flung interests. There are also many similarities, notably western politicians’ aversion to stopping the flow of oil. Russia is Italy in reverse. In the 1930s the league hung back because it feared that a ban would hurt Italy too much; now our leaders hesitate not because of damage to Russia but because of the harm it might do to their own citizens.

For a start, Europe is reliant on Russian gas. It accounts for one third of the European Union’s gas consumption and half its imports. Removing Russian gas would be disastrous for the economy. Chris Wheaton, an oil and gas analyst at Stifel, the investment group, reckons that it would mean a quadrupling of gas prices from their already elevated levels, some shutdown of industrial production and rolling blackouts. Imports of liquefied natural gas from other sources, such as Qatar or Australia, would not remotely fill the gap. A tough line on Russian gas might make a decent campaign slogan:

Shiver to Save Ukraine[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/household-energy-bills-set-to-hit-3-000-a-year-after-ukraine-invasion-bfc82dtc9]

.

Russia also provides about one tenth of the world’s oil, about ten million of the daily global consumption of 100 million barrels. Half its production is exported. An embargo would remove five million barrels a day from international markets, a move that traders think

would drive prices to unseen levels[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ftse-100-falls-sharply-and-oil-hits-105-a-barrel-after-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-m9vfgnhcf]

, perhaps $200 a barrel, certainly well in excess of the previous high of $147, a mark touched in 2008. Simon French, my fellow

Times

columnist and chief economist at Panmure Gordon, reckons a rough rule of thumb is that every $10 increase in the price of oil adds 0.4 of a percentage point to UK inflation. Using that as a guide, a ban on Russian oil imports could drive inflation up by four points, taking it to perhaps 11 per cent, a level not seen since the early 1980s. It would make the present cost-of-living crisis look mild, to say the least.

It also would be a devastating blow to the Russian economy, but one cushioned by its financial strength. Last year, according to the Russian finance ministry, oil and gas revenues totalled $119 billion and were running at about $500 million a day in the last quarter, before the recent rapid increase in the oil price. That is about a third of all Russian government revenues, with higher-than-expected prices (particularly for gas) helping the country to a $120 billion current account surplus. It has foreign exchange reserves of $630 billion and a debt-to-GDP ratio of 20 per cent, making the UK’s 100 per cent ratio look positively sub-prime.

A western ban on Russian fossil fuel exports would hurt the Kremlin, but it can afford to take the pain for some time. There almost certainly would be succour, too, in continued sales of Russian oil and gas to China.

If the West is serious about crippling the Russian economy through sanctions, and Boris Johnson did say this week that the grand plan was to wean the economy off Russian oil and gas, it should take a leaf out of President Putin’s book and do some serious preparation in advance. Other sources of oil production would need to be found before a ban were put in place. That probably would mean more from Saudi Arabia and a steady increase from Iraq and Libya. Some commentators have even suggested the West should come to an accommodation with Iran, a sanctioned state that has the capacity to produce nearly six million barrels of oil a day; now it is just over two million. More investment in renewable energy sources eventually will provide a long-term fix.

None of this is likely to happen soon enough to make a difference to the battle for Ukraine. Yet if the West is serious about stopping further Russian aggression, and about bringing about some domestic challenge to Putin’s rule, it needs to start planning now for an energy mix that excludes Russia.

Fury was mounting today over the EU's weak and divided attempts to sanction Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, as it was revealed the Italian PM demanded and got an exemption for his country's luxury goods industry .

Mario Draghi was accused of prioritising posh shoes over punishing Putin as EU nations 'disgraced themselves' with a failure to take a hardline approach to sanctions against Russia.

They were accused of frustrating British and American efforts to kick Russia out of the world's biggest financial payments system.

In a call with G7 leaders yesterday, Boris Johnson pressed the case for suspending Russia from Swift, which is used to conduct about half of its international trade.

But the move was kicked into the long grass because of opposition from a number of EU countries, US president Joe Biden suggested.

Sources told the Telegraph today that Draghi won the exemption for Italian luxury goods like shoes and designer clothes, saying: 'Apparently selling Gucci loafers to oligarchs is more of a priority than hitting back at Putin.'

Tonight the Italian PM denied it had happened, insisting on Twitter: 'Italy has made no requests for carve-outs on sanctions. Italy’s position is fully aligned with the rest of the EU.'

Polish politician Donald Tusk, who grew up behind the Iron Curtain, lashed out at Germany, Hungary and Italy for blocking Brussels from taking a hardline approach to Putin.

Mr Tusk, a former president of the European Council, tweeted: 'In this war everything is real: Putin's madness and cruelty, Ukrainian victims, bombs falling on Kyiv.

'Only your sanctions are pretended. Those EU government's, which blocked tough decisions (i.e. Germany, Hungary, Italy) have disgraced themselves.'

Additionally, French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said today that the option of cutting off Russia from Swift remained open, but that he viewed this only as a last resort.

Ukraine yesterday urged the West to trigger the move, with foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba warning that those who refused would have 'blood on their hands'.

Today President Volodymyr Zelenskyy demanded greater 'pressure' be placed on Russia as the capital Kyiv came under attack.

Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told MPs today: 'I hope we can win the argument because it feels like a sanction Russia would sit up and take notice of.'

What is Swift?

Swift, or the 'Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication', is a secure messaging system that facilitates rapid cross-border payments, making international trade flow smoothly.

Banks which connect to the system and establish relationships with other banks can use Swift messages to make payments.

The messages are secure so that payment instructions are typically honoured without question. This allows banks to process high volumes of transactions at speed.

It has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade. In 2020, around 38 million Swift messages were sent each day over the platform, according to its 2020 Annual Review.

Each year, trillions of dollars are transferred using the system.

Swift, founded in the 1970s, is a co-operative of thousands of member institutions which use the service.

Based in Belgium, it makes a modest profit $36 million in 2020. It is run principally as a service to its members.

If Swift were to exclude Russian banks, it would restrict the country's access to financial markets across the world.

Russian companies and individuals would find it harder to pay for imports and receive cash for exports, borrow or invest overseas.

Russian banks could use other channels for payments such as phones, messaging apps or email. The would allow Russian banks to make payments via banks in countries which have not imposed sanctions but since alternatives are likely to be less efficient and secure, transaction volumes could fall and costs rise.

If Russian banks were cut off from Swift, exporters would find selling goods to Russia riskier and more expensive.

Russia is a big buyer of manufactured goods. The Netherlands and Germany are its second and third biggest trading partners, based on World Bank data, although Russia is not a top 10 export market for either country.

Foreign buyers of Russian goods would also find it more difficult, potentially prompting them to seek alternative suppliers.

But when it comes to Russian oil and gas, foreign buyers could find it harder to find replacement suppliers.

Boris Johnson is expected to raise the prospect of banning Russia from the Swift payment system with allies again today, Downing Street said.

A spokesman for the Prime Minister was asked whether the UK would be pushing for the sanction and he said: 'You'll have heard the Prime Minister's comments in the House on this yesterday, we will continue to work with allies to try and cut Russia off from Swift.

'You'll be aware that the PM raised this in his call with G7 leaders yesterday, I expect he will raise it at the Nato leaders meeting again today.'

The spokesman would not be drawn on which countries were holding out on the proposal but he said: 'We've set out why we want to ensure that we can do this, as the Prime Minister said yesterday to ensure that we send a clear message to Vladimir Putin that his efforts will not succeed and to ensure that we can deal a severe blow to the Russian economy.'

But Joe Biden last night indicated the opposition had come from EU states. Asked whether Russia should be cut off from Swift, the US President said: 'It is always an option but right now that's not a position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.'

French Finance minister Bruno Le Maire said today that France and its European allies are determined to inflict great damage on Russian economy and punish Russia for the 'foolish decisions of Vladimir Putin' with 'massive and immediate sanctions.'

'We want to isolate Russia financially,' Le Maire said. 'We want to cut all ties between Russia and the global financial system. We will dry up the financing of the Russian economy.'

But hosting a meeting of EU counterparts in Paris on Friday to discuss the economic consequences, he said removing Moscow from Swift remained an option, but only as a last resort.

The Belgian-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) is a mechanism for making secure payments overseas and is widely used in international trade.

Mr Johnson is said to see Russia's suspension from Swift as an essential step in ensuring the Putin regime feels maximum economic pain for its invasion of Ukraine.

'The PM is very keen on this – he's pushing it very hard,' said one source.

The PM's official spokesman later confirmed that Mr Johnson had formally put the issue on the table at the G7 meeting, but said there had been only 'agreement that we ought to talk more about it'.

Diplomatic sources said Germany and Italy were the main opponents. Officials said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned that neither he nor the wider EU would support the move at this stage.

Diplomatic sources said opposition from Germany and Italy meant that a Swift ban would not be included in EU sanctions to be published today, despite some eastern European member states such as Lithuania pushing hard for it.

During a call with Mr Scholz this week, the PM warned him that 'Western inaction or underreaction would have unthinkable consequences'.

European concerns are said to centre on potential damage to their own economies if they are unable to buy Russian gas using the system. But ex-Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick said the crisis was now so serious that countries had to accept sacrifices to punish Russia.

Mr Jenrick told the Daily Mail: 'Suspending Russia from Swift is the single most effective, immediate act available to inflict serious harm on their financial system. Whilst Russia has developed alternatives, they are not the same, and there would be major dislocation.

'The UK appears to be arguing the case with our allies, which is hugely welcome, but sadly some nations are putting their short-term financial interests first. Russia is relying on such weakness, we need to go hard now or the cost will only increase.'

US-British financier Bill Browder, who once described himself as 'Vladimir Putin's number one enemy', yesterday said the suspension would knock Russia 'back to the dark ages'.

Mr Kuleba was even more outspoken, tweeting: 'Everyone who now doubts whether Russia should be banned from Swift has to understand that the blood of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children will be on their hands too.'

But some nations are said to be worried that the ban could lead to an even worse outcome, such as driving Russia into the arms of Chinese payment systems.

A summary of today's developments

* The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said he has extended a UK flight ban on Russian aircraft to include private jets. The government previously announced it was banning Russia’s flag carrier Aeroflot from landing in the UK.

* Boris Johnsonhas told Nato leaders that “immediate action” must be taken to ban Russia[https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia] from the Swift payment platform to “inflict maximum pain” on Vladimir Putin. The prime minister, who attended the virtual meeting of the leaders, warned Nato that Mr Putin was “engaging in a revanchist mission to overturn post-cold war order”, according to a No 10 spokesperson.

* Nato will deploy more troops to eastern Europe after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine[https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine], the alliance’s leaders have announced. “No one should be fooled by the Russian government’s barrage of lies,” the 30 leaders said in a statement after a virtual summit chaired by secretary general Jens Stoltenberg.

* The UK is no longer accepting visa applications from Ukrainians stuck in the country. This means there is no safe and legal route for them to seek asylum in Britain unless they have close family in the UK. Labour MP Nadia Whittome tweeted to say the move was “completely inhumane”.

* Vladimir Putin has urged the Ukrainian army to overthrow its leadership whom he labelled as a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who have lodged themselves in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people. ” Addressing the Ukrainian military in a televised address, a visibly angry Putin urged the military to “take power in your own hands”.

* An effort is under way to isolate Vladimir Putin diplomatically by challenging Russia’s right to a permanent seat of the UN security council on the grounds that Russia took the seat from the defunct Soviet Union in 1991 without proper authorisation. Diplomats are also looking to see if there is a basis for removing Russia from the presidency of the council.

* The Belarus ambassador to London, Maxim Yermalovich, was summoned to the Foreign Office and told new members of its ruling elite will be sanctioned as a result of their role in facilitating the invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces. James Cleverly, the Europe minister, said afterwards: “The UK condemns the role Belarus is playing in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Belarus must stop supporting Russia’s illegal and unprovoked actions.”

* In the first 24 hours of its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has not taken any of its major objectives and has lost more than 450 personnel, according to the defence secretary. Ben Wallace told Sky News it was the government’s view that Vladimir Putin intends “to invade the whole of Ukraine”[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/putin-ukraine-russian-army-failed-to-deliver-key-military-goals-day-one-ben-wallace].

* Keir Starmerhas said he believes “further financial restrictions” against Russia are needed. He said if Boris Johnson brought forward tougher sanctions on Russia, they would be voted through Parliament “very, very quickly” with the Labour Party’s support.

* The UK has said it will work “all day” to persuade fellow European states to cut Russia off from the international Swift payment system. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, ended the pretence that Britain was not at odds with its fellow European leaders over the issue[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/uk-says-it-will-work-all-day-to-persuade-europe-to-cut-russia-off-from-swift-ukraine]. He said there was still time for Russia to be excluded, and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: “The UK is working with allies to exclude Russia from the Swift financial system.”

* A total of 1,000 UK troops are on standby to support Ukraine’s neighbours with refugee responses, the armed forces minister has said. James Heappey

told MPs: “The 1,000 troops that are on standby are there to support Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Poland with the expected humanitarian challenges that they will face as people make their way out of Ukraine.”

Downing Street said Boris Johnson spoke to the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, this evening to discuss how western allies could further ratchet up pressure on the Russian regime.

A spokeswoman said: “The prime minister thanked the Canadian leader for his diplomatic efforts and coordination with allies on sanctions, and said the UK and Canada held a shared ambition in ensuring President Putin failed and was seen to fail.

“The prime minister said allies needed to take immediate action on SWIFT, and the leaders discussed further options to increase coordinated economic pressure on Russia.

“The world also needs to remain vigilant to potential for the Russian regime to further exploit vulnerabilities in other countries too, the leaders agreed.

“Both leaders said President Putin’s attack on Ukraine was an attack on democracies everywhere, and the world needed to stand together and support the Ukrainians in any way possible in their hour of need.”

Boris Johnson has addressed a message directly to the people of Russia, saying in Russian: “I do not believe this war is in your name.”

In a video posted on social media, the prime minister also spoke Ukrainian after urging an end to the conflict “because the world needs a free and sovereign Ukraine”.

He said: “The scenes unfolding in the streets and fields of Ukraine are nothing short of a tragedy.

“Brave young soldiers and innocent civilians are being cut down, tanks are rumbling through towns and cities, missiles raining indiscriminately from the skies.

“It’s a generation or more since we witnessed such bloodshed in Europe. We hoped we would never have to see such sights again.”

Russia has limited access to Facebook after the social media provider refused to stop fact-checking and labelling content from state-owned organisations, former deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg said.

Authorities in Russia announced the “partial restriction” after the social media network limited the accounts of several Kremlin-backed outlets over the invasion of Ukraine.

Russian state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said it had demanded that Facebook lifts the restrictions it placed on Thursday on state news agency RIA Novosti, state TV channel Zvezda, and pro-Kremlin news sites Lenta.Ru and Gazeta.Ru.

Russian ambassador to Ireland Yuri Filatov has claimed that his country’s invasion of Ukraine is a “humanitarian intervention”.

Filatov said there was no proof that Russian forces had targeted civilians in the assault.

He claimed Ukraine had used engagement in diplomacy in recent times as a cover for preparing an offensive on the Donbas region of the country.

“It’s not our choice, the military option is not our choice,” he told RTE.

He added: “There was no other choice to end the suffering of Donbas through real humanitarian intervention – that’s what this special operation is exactly about.

“The only aim of the operation is to neutralise the ability of the Ukrainian military to inflict any more suffering on Donbas. Ukrainians should not be afraid of that.”

Here is the full story on BP being warned of government “concern” about its involvement in Russia in a telephone call between the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, and the oil company’s boss Bernard Looney.

Kwarteng is understood to have spoken to Looney in the light of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which has increased scrutiny on British business ties to the Kremlin and led to sanctions against Russian firms.

Speaking after the call, a Whitehall source said: “BP left the meeting with no doubt about the strength of the business secretary’s concern about their commercial interest in Russia.”

The British oil “supermajor” has been deeply entwined with Russia for years: it has a 22% stake in Russian state oil firm Rosneft and holds two seats on the 11-strong board of the company.

Ireland’s deputy premier, Leo Varadkar, has described Vladimir Putin as the “Hitler of the 21st century”.

The tánaiste acknowledged that sanctions such as the potential banning of Russia from the Swift payment network would have economic implications for Ireland.

But he said those consequences needed to be accepted given the situation in Ukraine.

“I don’t think we’re in that space where we can be concerned about the economic impact on Ireland when a democratic country in the European Union is being invaded and the attempt is being made to overthrow a democratic government there,” he told RTE Radio One.

Varadkar added: “The last time I can think of that happening in Europe is in the 1930s and I think we should see this conflict in that context.

“We knew that Putin was a bad man, we’ve known that for a long time now, but we didn’t think that he would be the Hitler of the 21st century and I think he’s putting himself into that space.”

London law firms are delaying the sanctions levelled against their Russian oligarch clients by threatening to challenge the measures announced by the UK government, Liz Truss told MPs.

The foreign secretary was briefing MPs on the situation in Ukraine on Friday afternoon, according to the Labour MP for Exeter Ben Bradshaw.

Bradshaw, who was in the briefing, told the PA news agency Truss had been asked why the sanctions process had not been moving more quickly.

He said Truss told MPs it was “because they had to be very careful that when they sanctioned somebody it was legally watertight because these oligarchs’ lawyers in London are very litigious, and she had already had several warning letters from them”.

Bradshaw called for the law firms in question to be named in the first instance, but also potentially subject to sanctions themselves.

But lawyer David Allen Green said it was “twaddle” that any challenge could delay the sanctions.

Jessica Simor QC added that: “Law firms can’t hold it up. Only a court could.”

Charities and opposition parties have urged the government to do more to help with an expected surge in refugees fleeing Ukraine following the Russian invasion, with concerns also raised about the issuing of visas now UK diplomats have left the country.

With the UN refugee agency warning that as many as 5 million Ukrainians could be forced to flee, the Liberal Democrats called for a comprehensive and fully funded refugee scheme. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, said he wanted his country to be a “nation of sanctuary”.

Dozens of refugee charities have jointly called for an evacuation and resettlement plan similar to that which saw thousands of families housed in the UK following the Balkans conflicts in the 1990s.

“As a nation we have a kleptocracy problem: there are professional ‘enablers’ that help Russian kleptocrats obscure their ownership and sources of wealth, gain UK residency and property, and launder their reputations.

“This is structural, involving banks and property. It is not difficult to fix this, but this would involve the sort of regulation which has been opposed by influential UK businesses and elites.

As Russian troops pushed into Ukraine[https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine] on Thursday, viewers of the RT news channel learned a new vocabulary.

Rather than an invasion, the Russian actions[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/russia-attacks-ukraine-news-vladimir-putin-zelenskiy-russian-invasion] were described on air as a “special military operation”. Instead of seizing territory from another nation, viewers were told that troops were trying to “liberate” land from Ukraine on behalf of two Russian-backed breakaway states.

And if there was any doubt about the justification used by Vladimir Putin[https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin] for his war, then RT’s British presenter Rory Suchet – the son of the former ITN journalist John Suchet – explained to viewers that the objective was “to defend the Donbas” in the face of Ukrainian aggression.

The Kremlin-funded rolling news channel[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/29/24-hour-putin-people-my-week-watching-kremlin-propaganda-channel-rt-russia-today], which has long delighted in its own outsider status, has again come under intense scrutiny in the UK for its willingness to follow the narrative of the Russian government. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, demanded RT’s broadcast licence be revoked, telling the House of Commons the organisation once known as Russia Today was Putin’s “personal propaganda tool”. He added: “I can see no reason why it should be allowed to continue to broadcast in this country.”

Summary

Here’s a round up of the key developments so far:

* The UK is no longer accepting visa applications from Ukrainians stuck in the country. This means there is no safe and legal route for them to seek asylum in Britain unless they have close family in the UK. Labour MP Nadia Whittome tweeted to say the move was “completely inhumane”.

* Vladimir Putin has urged the Ukrainian army to overthrow its leadership whom he labelled as a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who have lodged themselves in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people. ” Addressing the Ukrainian military in a televised address, a visibly angry Putin urged the military to “take power in your own hands”.

* An effort is under way to isolate Vladimir Putin diplomatically by challenging Russia’s right to a permanent seat of the UN security council on the grounds that Russia took the seat from the defunct Soviet Union in 1991 without proper authorisation. Diplomats are also looking to see if there is a basis for removing Russia from the presidency of the council.

* The Belarus ambassador to London, Maxim Yermalovich, was summoned to the Foreign Office and told new members of its ruling elite will be sanctioned as a result of their role in facilitating the invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces. James Cleverly, the Europe minister, said afterwards: “The UK condemns the role Belarus is playing in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Belarus must stop supporting Russia’s illegal and unprovoked actions.”

* In the first 24 hours of its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has not taken any of its major objectives and has lost more than 450 personnel, according to the defence secretary. Ben Wallace told Sky News it was the government’s view that Vladimir Putin intends “to invade the whole of Ukraine”[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/putin-ukraine-russian-army-failed-to-deliver-key-military-goals-day-one-ben-wallace].

* Nato troops must not enter Ukraine because of the “risk of miscalculation” leading to “existential” threat, the armed forces minister has said. James Heappey has told MPs that the government would “explore all that we can do to support the Ukrainians themselves over the next few days”.

* Keir Starmerhas said he believes “further financial restrictions” against Russia are needed. He said if Boris Johnson brought forward tougher sanctions on Russia, they would be voted through Parliament “very, very quickly” with the Labour Party’s support.

* The UK has said it will work “all day” to persuade fellow European states to cut Russia off from the international Swift payment system. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, ended the pretence that Britain was not at odds with its fellow European leaders over the issue[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/uk-says-it-will-work-all-day-to-persuade-europe-to-cut-russia-off-from-swift-ukraine]. He said there was still time for Russia to be excluded, and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: “The UK is working with allies to exclude Russia from the Swift financial system.”

* Boris Johnsoncommitted to providing further support to Ukraine after receiving an update from president Volodymyr Zelensky on the “terrible developments” in Kyiv. Meanwhile, Zelensky said after the call that Ukraine demands “effective counteraction” from allies against Russia including further sanctions.

* A total of 1,000 UK troops are on standby to support Ukraine’s neighbours with refugee responses, the armed forces minister has said. James Heappey

told MPs: “The 1,000 troops that are on standby are there to support Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Poland with the expected humanitarian challenges that they will face as people make their way out of Ukraine.”

Russia is no longer allowed to participate in this year’s Eurovision Song Contest following the invasion of Ukraine, the competition’s producer has announced.

The European Broadcasting Union said in a statement that the inclusion of a Russian entry at the 2022 event in Turin would bring the contest into disrepute, PA news reports.

It comes after state broadcasters from countries including Iceland, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands called for Russia to be banned from competing.

The EBU said:

The Executive Board of the EBU made the decision following a recommendation earlier today by the Eurovision Song Contest’s governing body, the Reference Group, based on the rules of the event and the values of the EBU.

The Reference Group recommendation was also supported by the EBU’s Television Committee. The decision reflects concern that, in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine, the inclusion of a Russian entry in this year’s Contest would bring the competition into disrepute.

Before making this decision the EBU took time to consult widely among its membership.

The EBU is an apolitical member organisation of broadcasters committed to upholding the values of public service. We remain dedicated to protecting the values of a cultural competition which promotes international exchange and understanding, brings audiences together, celebrates diversity through music and unites Europe on one stage.

The 66th edition of Eurovision is due to take place in Turin after Italian rock band Maneskin won the 2021 contest.

An effort is under way to isolate Vladimir Putin diplomatically by challenging Russia’s right to a permanent seat of the UN security council on the grounds that Russia took the seat from the defunct Soviet Union in 1991 without proper authorisation.

Diplomats are also looking to see if there is a basis for removing Russia from the presidency of the council.

The presidency rotates monthly between the 15 members of the security council, allowing the office holder to shape its monthly agenda and to chair its meetings.

The Russian envoy Vassily Nebenzias was chairing an emergency meeting[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/moment-that-putin-thundered-to-war-drowning-out-last-entreaties-for-peace] of the security council in New York on Wednesday night as Putin announced his assault on Ukraine. Nebenzias started reading out a text sent to his phone by the Kremlin justifying the attack. He maintained the fiction that an invasion was not under way but instead a special military operation had begun in the Donbas.

Most council members condemned Russia, one of the five permanent security council members, with the UN secretary general António Guterres taking the rare step of accusing Russia of being in breach of the UN charter.

A draft security council motion, condemning Russia and calling for its unconditional withdrawal, is being negotiated behind the scenes in New York and will probably be debated on Friday, but Russia as a permanent member will use its veto.

The Ukrainian ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, told Wednesday night’s meeting that article 4 of the UN charter says the UN is open only to peace-loving states that accept the terms of the charter. He said Russia’s actions showed it could not comply with those terms.

The Foreign Office said the measures allow the UK to sanction not just Russians that support the Russian state, but individuals and entities in other countries that support Russia.

The Foreign Office said Belarus needs to desist from its support to Russia and respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty in line with its international obligations.

In recent weeks Belarus has allowed Russian troops to conduct exercises on its soil in full knowledge that they were there to prepare for the attack on Ukraine.

At present 108 citizens from Belarus are subject to asset freezes as are 10 entities.

The Scottish Greens’ equality and human rights spokesperson Maggie Chapman MSP called on Priti Patel to immediately establish safe and legal routes for Ukrainians to travel directly to the UK to claim asylum.

Maggie Chapman said:

The UK government has a responsibility to provide a humanitarian response and that must include support for those forced to flee Ukraine.

The move to extend visas for Ukrainians already in the UK is welcome, but it is essential that more is done.

The home secretary should take inspiration from countries such as Ireland and Moldova and ensure that the UK is ready to welcome those fleeing conflict, especially those who may be most at risk under a Russian occupation, such as journalists and LGBT people.

Meanwhile, the international Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is making preparations for an influx of refugees.

Christof Johnen, head of international cooperation at the German Red Cross, told Reuters the establishment of reception camps for refugees was under discussion, but that there was still no reliable indication of how many refugees might come.

He said:

We have reports that civilian facilities have also been affected by the fighting. People are insecure, people try to hide. In formal shelters, but of course also in informal ones, in basements and so on.

We were warned about Vladimir Putin – about his intentions, his nature, his mindset – and, because it was profitable for us, we ignored those warnings and welcomed his friends and their money. It is too late for us to erase our responsibility for helping Putin build his system. But we can still dismantle it and stop it coming back.

Russia is a mafia state, and its elite exists to enrich itself. Democracy is an existential threat to that theft, which is why Putin has crushed it at home and seeks to undermine it abroad. For decades, London has been the most important place not only for Russia’s criminal elite to launder its money, but also for it to stash its wealth. We have been the Kremlin’s bankers, and provided its elite with the financial skills it lacks. Its kleptocracy could not exist without our assistance. The best time to do something about this was 30 years ago – but the second best time is right now.

Ben Wallace told Sky News it was the government’s view that Vladimir Putin intends “to invade the whole of Ukraine”[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/putin-ukraine-russian-army-failed-to-deliver-key-military-goals-day-one-ben-wallace].

* Nato troops must not enter Ukraine because of the “risk of miscalculation” leading to “existential” threat, the armed forces minister has said. James Heappey has told MPs that the government would “explore all that we can do to support the Ukrainians themselves over the next few days”.

* Keir Starmerhas said he believes “further financial restrictions” against Russia are needed. He said if Boris Johnson brought forward tougher sanctions on Russia, they would be voted through Parliament “very, very quickly” with the Labour Party’s support.

* The UK has said it will work “all day” to persuade fellow European states to cut Russia off from the international Swift payment system. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, ended the pretence that Britain was not at odds with its fellow European leaders over the issue[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/uk-says-it-will-work-all-day-to-persuade-europe-to-cut-russia-off-from-swift-ukraine]. He said there was still time for Russia to be excluded, and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: “The UK is working with allies to exclude Russia from the Swift financial system.”

* Boris Johnsoncommitted to providing further support to Ukraine after receiving an update from president Volodymyr Zelensky on the “terrible developments” in Kyiv. Meanwhile, Zelensky said after the call that Ukraine demands “effective counteraction” from allies against Russia including further sanctions.

* A total of 1,000 UK troops are on standby to support Ukraine’s neighbours with refugee responses, the armed forces minister has said. James Heappey

told MPs: “The 1,000 troops that are on standby are there to support Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Poland with the expected humanitarian challenges that they will face as people make their way out of Ukraine.”

A Royal Navy destroyer has set sail to be on standby in the Mediterranean following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

HMS Diamond left Portsmouth naval base as part of the UK’s response to support Nato countries in eastern Europe.

The government said it had deployed the vessel in case it is required as part of a wider Nato force.

The Type 45 destroyer will join offshore patrol vessel HMS Trent in the eastern Mediterranean with four additional RAF Typhoon jets also being deployed to Cyprus to take part in Nato patrols in eastern Europe.

Hundreds of troops have also been deployed to Estonia and Poland.

HMS Diamond had originally been set to leave on February 17 but its departure was initially delayed by Storm Eunice with further delays caused by the warship requiring “minor repairs”.

The problems meant that all of the navy’s fleet of Type 45s were alongside at the same time, with four vessels in Portsmouth and two in Birkenhead.

The defence select committee warned in December 2021 that the “low availability of the UK’s Type 45 destroyers and recognised issues in their propulsion systems are a major cause for concern”.

The EU is preparing to freeze the assets of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, as part of a third round of sanctions against Russia, the Financial Times reports.

Foreign ministers are planning to approve the sanctions package this afternoon, along with a number of measures against Russian banks and industry, the paper quotes three people familiar with the matter.

Putin and Lavrov will not be subject to a ban on travelling under the measures, the FT writes, underlining the EU’s willingness to keep symbolic diplomatic possibilities open.

An EU official, speaking under condition of anonymity, told Reuters: “We are moving as quickly as we can,” adding the bloc could also target “many more” oligarchs.

The UK has said it will work “all day” to persuade fellow European states to cut Russia off from the international Swift payment system.

The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, ended the pretence that Britain was not at odds with its fellow European leaders over the issue. He said there was still time for Russia to be excluded, and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: “The UK is working with allies to exclude Russia from the Swift financial system.”

Wallace added: “We will work all the magic, do everything we can in diplomacy.”

Truss is to undertake a round of shuttle diplomacy to try to rally support for the British position after the EU refused to adopt what has been billed as the “nuclear option” of sanctions.

British officials said that the EU, reflecting the divisions at its council meeting on Thursday, kept the Swift option on the table. UK diplomats are arguing that with Ukrainian forces mounting a defence of their country, and scattered signs of unease in Russian cities, this is the moment to try to get ahead of Putin for once and surprise him with a move that would send the Russian economy straight into the deep freeze.

The British position has the support of Canada and some US senators. British officials insist they will keep up the pressure for the policy even if Kyiv falls.

Boris Johnson lobbied the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on Wednesday on the issue but made no progress. Johnson’s position, also raised at a virtual meeting of the G7, is backed by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer.

The Swift payment system (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the main secure messaging system that banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, allowing international trade to flow smoothly. It has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade. In 2020, about 38m transactions were sent each day over the Swift platform, facilitating trillions of dollars’ worth of deals.

Swift is incorporated under Belgian law and, although supervised by a complex web of central banks, it was forced in 2012 to comply with an EU regulation, as confirmed by its home country government, that had cut Iran off from the banking system.

Wallace said:

We would like to go further. We’d like to do the Swift system – that is the financial system that allows the Russians to move money around the world to receive payments for its gas – but … these are international organisations and if not every country wants them to be thrown out of the Swift system, it becomes difficult.

Opponents of the move argue that it would incentivise Russia to try to use an alternative fledgling scheme. They also say it would be dangerous for countries highly dependent on Russia for their energy, principally Italy.

Boris Johnson will host the leaders of the V4 countries in London next month to discuss the Ukraine crisis.

No 10 said the prime minister will hold a meeting with the leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia on March 8 to “discuss the situation in Ukraine and the UK’s support for security in the region”.

12.37pm GMT

An estimated 450 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict in Ukraine so far and Vladimir Putin failed in his military objectives on the first day of fighting, the UK defence secretary has said.

Ben Wallace also rebuffed pleas on Friday morning from Ukrainian and some Conservative politicians for the UK to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine, arguing that introducing one would amount to declaring war on Russia.

“Our assessment as of this morning is that Russia has not taken any of its major objectives, in fact it is behind its hoped-for timetable,” Wallace told Sky News.

They have lost over 450 personnel. One of the significant airports they were trying to capture with their elite Spetsnaz [special forces] has failed to be taken. In fact, the Ukrainians have taken it back.

So, I think contrary to great Russian claims, and indeed President Putin’s sort of vision that somehow the Ukrainians would be liberated and would be flocking to his cause – he’s got that completely wrong. The Russian army has failed to deliver on day one its main objective.

In a later exchange on BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme, the Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko pleaded with Wallace for the UK and the US to close airspace above Ukraine “in order for these casualties not to escalate”.

However Wallace said this would constitute a direct act of aggression towards Russia, which would prompt a response, and result in “war across Europe” as any attack on the UK would implicate all other Nato members.

Wallace said:

To do a no-fly zone I would have to put British fighter jets against Russian; Nato would have to declare war on Russia.

I cannot and won’t trigger a European war but I will help Ukraine fight every street with every piece of equipment we can support them.

Vasylenko warned that Europe is already at war, since “if Ukraine is allowed to fall others will follow”, and other democratic nations should seek to protect a fellow sovereign country.

She said:

What you are witnessing is a restructuring of the defence and security framework we are so used to.

A source told her:

Labour will no longer tolerate the selfishness of those who aren’t focused on winning the next election.

Young Labour has declared its support for Stop The War “and other pro-peace activists”.

Yesterday, a group of 11 Labour MPs from the left of the party removed their names from a statement about the invasion of Ukraine, which heavily criticises Nato after being warned they risked losing the party whip.

Boris Johnson is expected to raise the prospect of banning Russia from the Swift payment system with allies again on Friday, Downing Street said.

A spokesman for the prime minister was asked whether the UK would be pushing for the sanction and he said:

You’ll have heard the prime minister’s comments in the house on this yesterday, we will continue to work with allies to try and cut Russia off from Swift.

You’ll be aware that the PM raised this in his call with G7 leaders yesterday, I expect he will raise it at the Nato leaders meeting again today.

The spokesman would not be drawn on which countries were holding out on the proposal but he said:

We’ve set out why we want to ensure that we can do this, as the prime minister said yesterday to ensure that we send a clear message to Vladimir Putin that his efforts will not succeed and to ensure that we can deal a severe blow to the Russian economy.

As I say, the Prime Minister will raise it again later today.

12.15pm GMT

The government is working “incredibly closely” with Ukraine’s neighbours to support those fleeing the country, No 10 said.

A spokesman for Boris Johnson said and he pointed towards the home secretary’s announcement on visa extensions.

You’ll be aware that we deployed an extra 350 troops to Poland a fortnight ago to help exactly with that task.

1,000 UK troops are on stand-by to support refugee response

A total of 1,000 UK troops are on standby to support Ukraine’s neighbours with refugee responses, the armed forces minister has said.

Labour MP Alex Davies-Jones asked:

Will the 1,000 UK troops that he has placed on standby to help with the humanitarian crisis now be urgently deployed?

James Heappey replied:

Just to be very clear – because I think unless I am almost doing her a disservice – I might have understood her question to be will the 1,000 troops go into Ukraine as they did into Kabul into the summer to facilitate the egress of Ukrainians.

I am afraid she will be disappointed. That is just not something that could realistically be done. This is a highly kinetic combat situation and the probability of Nato troops being caught up in combat with Russian armed forces is far too high and would lead to huge escalation.

The 1,000 troops that are on standby are there to support Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Poland with the expected humanitarian challenges that they will face as people make their way out of Ukraine.

Conservative MP Luke Evans asked:

What sanctions and steps will we take to make sure that Belarus feel the pain for what they are doing?

Heappey replied:

The Belarusian ambassador has been summoned to the Foreign Office today to have the views of Her Majesty’s government shared with them. Belarus has also been included in the sanctions regime.

Downing Street said “nothing is off the table” in support of Ukraine.

A spokesman for Boris Johnson said:

We remain firmly behind Ukraine and will continue to support them.

The spokesman said he could not go into detail over the support being provided but the UK had “talked about protective equipment, helmets, body armour, as well as some of the defensive lethal aid that we’ve provided in terms of anti-tank weaponry”.

12.08pm GMT

The public inquiry into how a British woman was fatally poisoned after being exposed to Novichok has been delayed, in a decision which has been condemned by the coroner and the victim’s family.

Dawn Sturgess died in July 2018 after she unwittingly came into contact with the nerve agent on a discarded perfume bottle in Amesbury, Wiltshire.

The UK government and Scotland Yard believe the Kremlin was responsible for the act, prompting Priti Patel three months ago to order the inquest into Sturgess’s death be converted into a public inquiry to better establish the extent of Russian involvement.

At what was intended to be the inquiry’s first hearing on Friday at the Royal Courts of Justice, coroner Lady Heather Hallett, who has now been appointed to lead the Covid-19 inquiry, was told her successor had still not been appointed, resulting in further delays.

Michael Mansfield, representing the victim’s family and Sturgess’s partner Charlie Rowley, said the Russian invasion of Ukraine this week underlined the need to progress with the inquiry without delay.

He told the 30-minute hearing:

As of today, or yesterday, there is a poignancy about what is happening in Ukraine and eastern Europe at the moment, for the necessity of this inquiry not losing a single day.

Hallett said she had been putting “extreme pressure on, behind the scenes” to ensure her successor was appointed.

She added:

It is, I have to say, a disappointment to me to be sitting here today with no inquiry set up and no judge appointed to lead it.

I have seen a letter from Birnberg Peirce, the solicitors who represent the Sturgess family and also Mr Rowley, expressing a degree of frustration at the delay - that is a frustration that I share.

Ben Watson, counsel for the government, said a chairman was expected to be appointed in the next two weeks.

He said it was “regrettable” the appointment had not been made, and added that “recent events” had increased demands on the government.

Hallett concluded:

Many other people have been affected (by the poisoning) and they too have the right to have these proceedings heard as soon as possible.

Sturgess died in hospital after she and Rowley became seriously ill in Amesbury.

It followed the attempted murder of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, his daughter Yulia and ex-police officer Nick Bailey, who were poisoned in nearby Salisbury in March that year when members of a Russian military intelligence squad are believed to have smeared the deadly nerve agent on Skripal’s door handle in Salisbury.

All three survived, as did Rowley.

Responding to shadow defence secretary John Healey, James Heappey says anti-tank missiles had “already proven to be invaluable” in the conflict in Ukraine.

The armed forces minister says the weapons were “high on our list of things that we are looking to supply”, adding:

They are unsubstantiated reports, but nonetheless we are aware of the number of circumstances in which they have been used to defeat Russian armour, and we are therefore very aware of their utility both in open battle during the initial phase of the conflict but also in the urban domain in any resistance or insurgency that might follow.

Heappey also shares insight that Russia’s invasion had not been as successful as planned.

He says:

Suffice to say, we are pretty certain that in the Kremlin last night there will have been some pretty urgent reflections on the speed of the advance compared to what they anticipated.

I think that Russian people should be calling President Putin and the kleptocracy that surrounds him out on that, because young Russian men and women are being sacrificed in the name of President Putin’s hubris.

11.40am GMT

Shadow defence secretary John Healey has pressed the government on whether the UK will provide Ukraine with short-range handheld anti-tank missiles.

He says:

On Wednesday, the prime minister told the house the UK will be shortly providing a further package of military support to Ukraine. We understand the minister’s comments about detail, but has this further military assistance being provided?

The minister knows he has Labour’s full support for this.

Healey says the “UK’s short-range handheld anti-tank missiles are working well”, adding:

He knows that the Ukrainians need more of these urgently to defend Kiev and their other cities. So, can he confirm that he is willing to go that bit further?

Healey concludes his remarks by saying:

We’ve taken peace and security in Europe for granted since the end of the Cold War. We can no longer do that.

I fear that we will be dealing with the consequences of this Russian invasion now for years to come.

11.32am GMT

Sending Nato forces to Ukraine would risk leading to 'existential' threat

Nato troops must not enter Ukraine because of the “risk of miscalculation” leading to “existential” threat, the armed forces minister has said.

James Heappey has told MPs that the government would “explore all that we can do to support the Ukrainians themselves over the next few days”.

He adds:

But we must all in this house be clear that British and Nato troops should not, must not, play an active role in Ukraine.

We must all be clear what the risk of miscalculation could be and how existential that could very quickly become if people miscalculate and things escalate unnecessarily.

Updated at 12.18pm GMT

11.31am GMT

Conservative MP Peter Bone has asked the armed forces minister to update the house on whether the UK and Western allies will institute a no-fly zone on Ukraine.

Bone says:

We are seeing history repeat itself, as a powerful country, headed by a mad man, is extending its territorial boundaries. First by annexing regions of sovereign countries and then invading those countries. This, of course, is what happened in the 1930s and led to World War.

He adds:

The Ukraine ambassador to the United Kingdom has asked for us and our allies to institute a no-fly zone of Ukraine. As the ambassador said, people are dying as we speak.

This action will be a significant and a real help for the people of Ukraine. Yesterday, when I asked the Prime Minister about this request, he indicated it was not ruled out. Could the minister update the House on this request for help?

James Heappey said a no-fly zone is “somewhat difficult to implement in a hostile airspace against a peer adversary”.

He noted eyes must be open to the reality that “in such an event, Nato jets would not possibly, but would most certainly probably, come into a combat situation with Russian jets.”

Heappey went on:

The risk of miscalculation and escalation and the triggering of Article 5 could not be understated in those circumstances. In the air domain, the risk of miscalculation is greater because things are happening at Mach 2. And there is no time for political calibration.

11.27am GMT

Shadow defence secretary John Healey says Europe took peace for “granted”.

The Labour MP says:

We’ve taken peace & security in Europe for granted since the end of the Cold War.

We can no longer do that.

11.26am GMT

Britain is going through all of its military kit to see what can be sent to Ukraine, James Heappey has told MPs.

The armed forces minister says:

We want to see as much British kit in the hands of Ukrainians as we can manage.

11.24am GMT

Asked by shadow defence secretary John Healey which specific objectives Russia failed to achieve, James Heappey won’t divulge intelligence.

However, he does say: “Putin may have bitten off more than he can chew” with his Invasion of Ukraine.

The armed forces minister adds he is “pretty certain” people “in the Kremlin” will be asking questions about the invasion.

The UK will send further armed forces to Estonia “earlier than planned” to reinforce the Nato ally in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Responding to an urgent question, Defence minister James Heappey told the Commons:

In addition to the Royal Tank Regiment battle group that has been in place in Estonia for the last six months, the Royal Welsh battlegroup will be arriving in Estonia earlier than planned to double up our force levels and those doubled-up force levels remain indefinitely.

They will be augmented by the headquarters of 12 Mechanised Brigade, meaning that the United Kingdom will have an armoured brigade in Estonia reassuring one of our closest Nato allies.

Labour leader Keir Starmer has said if Boris Johnson brought forward tougher sanctions on Russia, they would be voted through Parliament “very, very quickly” with the Labour Party’s support.

He also strengthened his appeal for Russia to be banned from international financial system Swift, describing the move as a “now decision” which should be made as soon as possible.

He told BBC Breakfast:

That is a now decision and the Labour Party would support it in full. We think it should happen now.

Starmer called for shell companies in the UK supporting Vladimir Putin ’s regime to be targeted, saying there was “frustration” in parliament that the government hasn’t “got on with this”.

He continued:

What I’ve said to the prime minister is whatever criticism I’ve got for you, not having done it now, do it now. If you bring forward legislation, I said to the prime minister on Monday, we the Labour party will vote for it.

We could bring this through parliament very, very quickly because those shell companies are hiding assets that are supporting Putin and we have to get our house in order and there’s such a will in parliament at the moment.

10.44am GMT

Defence minister Baroness Goldie said there is currently no indication Russia intends to “directly target” UK or Nato forces, but they “remain on guard”, with cyber attacks expected.

Opening a debate in the House of Lords, Lady Goldie said 1,000 troops are on stand-by to deal with the exodus of people from Ukraine.

She told peers:

It goes without saying that our thoughts and prayers remain with the Ukrainian people, many of whom have family and friends in the UK, and will now find themselves under attack for no reason whatsoever.

But at the same time we remain on guard. While there is no indication at present that Russia intends to directly target British or Nato forces, we should expect their forces and proxies to launch cyber attacks and misinformation campaigns, seeking opportunities to embarrass the UK or Nato and to undermine our resolve.

We stand ready to protect our country against any threats, whether conventional or in cyberspace.

However, I’m afraid there’s no disguising the fact that a dark new chapter has opened in our history.

The government has been pressed to give an update on China’s position on Ukraine and on missiles “arriving in Serbia ready to destabilise” peace in Bosnia.

As the Commons began a Friday sitting, Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin said:

I appreciate there is an urgent question on Ukraine later on, but I wonder if the government has given any indication about whether they are going to make a statement about our relations with China, given that China has done nothing to condemn the Ukrainian incursion, and whether the government will also make a statement about what is happening in the Balkans where I understand that missiles are arriving in Serbia ready to destabilise the Dayton Agreement and create a new crisis there.

Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he was sure the government would take Jenkin’s comments “very seriously”.

Hoyle said:

I have been given no notification that anything is forthcoming. What I would say is that we do have the urgent question and I am sure that he may be able to press the minister if he were able to catch my eye.

Ben Wallace said Britain will “work all day” to try to get the Swift international payment system “turned off for Russia”.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme:

Britain wants the Swift system to be turned off for Russia. But unfortunately the Swift system is not in our control - it’s not a unilateral decision.

Wallace said the system is used “to move money around”, explaining:

When you pay Russia for its gas, it probably goes through the Swift system, for example. It is based in Belgium. It has a number of partners that control it, or nation states.”

We want it switched off. Other countries do not. We only have so many options. We are going to work all day to try and get it (switched off for Russia).

Ben Wallace said Vladimir Putin “won’t stop” after invading Ukraine.

He said the decision not to “put British service personnel in direct fighting” was not about “risk”, but to avoid triggering a “war across Europe”.

“It’s not about risk, as much as I care for my personnel. It’s not about risk,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

It’s about if we were to directly attack Russian aircraft, we would have a war across Europe.

I have said continually for a long time, as has Britain, and the prime minister has supported this position, that Putin is not rational.

He is trying to invade Ukraine. He won’t stop after he’s... with Ukraine. He will use everything in the Baltic states. He doesn’t believe the Baltic states are really countries.

And we will have to stand up to it. Now, I cannot trigger a European war and I won’t trigger a European war. But what I will do is help Ukraine fight every street with every piece of equipment we can get to them, and we will support them, and that is the reality.

Boris Johnson committed to providing further support to Ukraine after receiving an update from president Volodymyr Zelensky on the “terrible developments” in Kyiv.

A Downing Street statement said:

The prime minister spoke to president Zelensky this morning to express his solidarity with Ukraine.

President Zelensky updated the prime minister on the most recent Russian military advances, including missile and artillery strikes on Ukrainian cities and the terrible developments in Kyiv in the early hours of this morning.

The prime minister assured president Zelensky that the world is united in its horror at what Putin his doing. He paid tribute to the bravery and heroism of the Ukrainian people in standing up to Russia’s campaign of violence, and expressed his deep condolences for those who have been killed.

The prime minister committed to provide further UK support to Ukraine in the coming days as the people of Ukraine and the world continue to demonstrate that Putin cannot act with impunity.

Meanwhile, Zelensky said after the call that Ukraine demands “effective counteraction” from allies against Russia including further sanctions.

The Ukrainian leader tweeted:

Held talks with PM BorisJohnson. Reported on the course of (Ukraine’s) defence and insidious attacks on Kyiv by the aggressor. Today (Ukraine) needs the support of partners more than ever.

Ben Wallace has said British troops will not be sent to fight “directly” with the Russians.

The defence secretary told BBC Breakfast they had provided training for more than 20,000 Ukrainians, which he described as “the next best thing”.

He said sending troops in would trigger a European war.

I said very clearly about a month ago that we are not going to be sending British troops to fight directly with Russian troops.

We are going to hold the line in Nato. We’ve always supported Ukraine’s application to Nato over the last 15 years, not every country has wanted them to join.

We’ve done the next best thing, which is train over 20,000 Ukrainians, provided them with lethal capabilities, which they are using right now.

But I’m not putting British troops directly to fight Russian troops. That would trigger a European war, because we are a Nato country, and Russia would therefore be attacking Nato.

Labour leader Keir Starmer has said Jeremy Corbyn was wrong about Nato and the party itself has “never wavered” in its support for the alliance.

Asked on Sky News about the former Labour leader’s stance on stopping the expansion of Nato, Starmer said:

Jeremy Corbyn was wrong about that but the Labour Party’s policy never shifted under his leadership and I’ve been very clear.

He added that the “collective failure of the West” in the past response to Vladimir Putin may have emboldened the Russian president but described the party’s support for Nato as “unshakeable”.

He said:

I do think that the failure, the collective failure, of you know, the West... in relation to action he’s taken in the past, so many examples - Georgia, Crimea, Donbas - have given him the sense that as I say the benefits of aggression outweigh the costs.

We have to be clear that that isn’t the case here in relation to Ukraine and that that response package from the rest of the world will be so strong that it will not only isolate Russia but also cripple its ability to function.

For anyone who missed it, a group of 11 Labour MPs from the left of the party removed their names yesterday from a statement about the invasion of Ukraine, which heavily criticises Nato after being warned they risked losing the party whip.

In a rapid victory for Starmer over MPs still linked to Corbyn, the Labour chief whip wrote to the 11 backbenchers asking them to remove their signatures from a statement drawn up by the Stop the War group.

A party spokesperson later said all the MPs had agreed to do so.

The Stop the War statement, which accuses the UK government of “sabre-rattling” over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, also criticises it for saying Ukraine has a right to join Nato if it wishes.

Keir Starmer has said he believes “further financial restrictions” against Russia are needed.

Speaking on Good Morning Britain, the Labour leader said he supported the government’s package of sanctions announced yesterday but called for extra measures.

He said the UK should “break open” shell companies in Britain providing support to Vladimir Putin and target Russia via Swift, an international financial system.

Reacting to news that Russian troops were nearing Kyiv, Starmer said the situation was “extremely serious” and Britain should be “absolutely clear” in its stance.

He said:

We have to stand together with our allies, particularly Nato, and it’s very important we must stand together as one United Kingdom, and therefore yesterday was significant in Parliament because all political parties spoke with one voice in our support for Ukraine and our support for Nato.

In relation to the sanctions, I thought what the Government put forward earlier this week was not strong enough. They came forward yesterday with a stronger package and I was able to say that we, the opposition, will support those further sanctions.

I do want to go further. I think that we do need further financial restrictions, particularly the Swift mechanism. I also think we’ve got to break open the shell companies we have here in the UK that are providing financial support for Putin.

9.22am GMT

In the first 24 hours of its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has not taken any of its major objectives and has lost more than 450 personnel, according to the defence secretary.

However, Ben Wallace told Sky News it was the government’s view that Vladimir Putin intends “to invade the whole of Ukraine”.

But he said Russia was “behind its hoped-for timetable” in the military action against its neighbour.

He said:

Our assessment, as of this morning, is that Russia has not taken any of its major objectives,” the defence secretary said.

In fact it’s behind its hoped-for timetable. They’ve lost over 450 personnel.

One of the significant airports they were trying to capture with their elite spetsnaz [special forces] has failed to be taken and, in fact, the Ukrainians have taken it back.

So I think, contrary to great Russian claims and indeed President Putin’s vision that somehow the Ukrainians would be liberated and would be flocking to his cause, he’s got that completely wrong.

And the Russian army has failed to deliver on day one its main objective.

After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, more EU nations on Saturday pledged support for a ban on Russia from a global payments network.

EU leaders including France and Italy's prime ministers are moving to exclude Russia from using the Swift banking network, in a bid to step up sanctions on the country.

The move would hit Russian trade as Swift permits rapid cross-border payments and is the main means for financing international business.

Italy's prime minister Mario Draghi spoke to Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday to reiterate that "Italy fully supports and will continue to support the European Union’s line on sanctions against Russia, including those regarding Swift," the government confirmed in a statement[https://www.governo.it/it/articolo/ucraina-telefonata-draghi-zelensky/19274].

EXPLAINED: How Italy could be impacted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine[https://www.thelocal.it/20220224/explained-how-italy-could-be-impacted-by-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/]

Draghi added that Italy "will provide Ukraine with assistance to defend itself".

Ukraine's president welcomed the phone call with Italy's political leader, stating that it marked a a "beginning" between Ukraine and Italy.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba wrote in a tweet that the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, also showed support for piling financial pressure on Russia by banning it from the Swift financial system.

From their phone call, he claimed that France says it's "ready to supply weapons and military equipment to help Ukraine defend itself".

The fresh support for this sanction marks a U-turn for some EU leaders as Italy, Germany and other European nations were heavily criticised on Thursday for their reservations about cutting Russia off from the Swift international payments system.

Former European Council President Donald Tusk hit back on Friday, saying some EU governments had “disgraced themselves” by blocking “tough decisions”.

Germany has expressed a lukewarm response to banning Russia from Swift payments, by suggesting it is open to the idea but needs to calculate the economic impact first, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said[https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/finanzminister-lindner-verteidigt-vorlaeufigen-verzicht-auf-swift-ausschluss-russlands-100.html] on Friday.

Russia launched a full-scale attack against Ukraine on Thursday, to which the EU has since responded by announcing various sanctions against Russia.

The UK ambassador to the UN has said "Russia is isolated" after Moscow vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling on it to stop the invasion of Ukraine and withdraw its troops.

Dame Barbara Woodward said following the vote it was "absurd" for Russia to claim the invasion was in self-defence.

"Russia's only act of self-defence is the vote they have cast against this resolution today," Dame Barbara said.

"Make no mistake: Russia is isolated.

"It has no support for the invasion of Ukraine.

"History will record how we voted today and which countries stood up to be counted in defence of the Charter and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.

"The United Kingdom stands steadfast in support of the Ukrainian people and will hold Russia accountable for its aggression."

Milla Jovovich said she was "torn in two" to watch the horror unfolding in her home country of Ukraine, as violence continued.

"I am heartbroken and dumbstruck trying to process the events of this week in my birthplace of Ukraine. My country and people being bombed," the Resident Evil actress wrote online.

"Friends and family in hiding. My blood and my roots come from both Russia and Ukraine.

"I am torn in two as I watch the horror unfolding, the country being destroyed, families being displaced, their whole life lying in charred fragments around them."

Facebook has said it is prohibiting Russian state media from running any advertising on or monetising from its platform.

The firm's head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said in a statement: "We are now prohibiting Russian state media from running ads or monetising on our platform anywhere in the world.

"We also continue to apply labels to additional Russian state media.

"These changes have already begun rolling out and will continue into the weekend."

Mr Gleicher added Facebook was "closely monitoring" the situation in Ukraine and would "keep sharing steps we're taking to protect people on our platform".

Joe Biden has signed a memorandum on the provision of up to 600 million dollars (£448 million) in immediate military aid to Ukraine.

The document issued by the White House said Mr Biden made the order under part of the Foreign Assistance Act to "determine whether it is important to the security interests of the United States to furnish up to 250 million dollars (£187 million) in assistance without regard to any provision of law".

He also signed it "to direct the drawdown of up to an aggregate value of 350 million dollars (£261 million) in defence articles and services of the Department of Defence, and military education and training, and to make the determinations required under such section to direct such a drawdown".

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has survived a night of Russian assaults on Kyiv and instructed people not to believe "fake news".

"Good morning everybody. Do not believe fake news. I am here," Mr Zelensky said in Ukrainian in a selfie video posted to social media.

"We will not lay down our weapons. We will defend our Country. Our weapons are our strength. This is our land. Our country. Our children. We will protect all of them," he added in the video, which appeared to be shot in downtown Kyiv.

Armed Forces Minister James Heappey has said that Ukrainian forces defending Kyiv have been putting up "incredible resistance".

Mr Heappey said the situation was "very grave" but that the fighting in the capital was so far confined to "very isolated pockets of Russian special forces and paratroopers".

"The main armoured columns approaching Kyiv are still some way off. That is a testament to the incredible resistance the Ukrainian armoured forces have put up over the last 48 hours or so," he told Sky News.

"Clearly the Russian plan is to take Kyiv but the reality is that the Ukrainians are thwarting them thus far.

"It looks like the Russian plan is nowhere near running to schedule.

"I think that will be a great cause of concern for President Putin and rather points to the fact that there was a lot of hubris in the Russian plan and that he may be awfully advised."

Armed forces minister James Heappey has said the UK is looking to continue to supply weapons to the Ukrainian armed forces.

Mr Heappey said that Defence Secretary Ben Wallace chaired a donors conference of Friday with 25 nations, some of whom pledged to send arms and other aid.

"We know what the Ukrainians want. We are doing our best to get it to them," he told Sky News.

Mr Heappey said the Government was working on plans to support a resistance movement and a Ukrainian government in exile if Kyiv does fall.

"That is a decision for the National Security Council to take but it is something that the Prime Minister has asked us in the Ministry of Defence to look at and plan for," he said.

He said that the West was facing a prolonged period of "acute competition" with Russia as it sought to achieve fundamental change in the country.

"There is a 10, 20-year project where the West will be back into quite acute competition, where imposing cost on Putin and the kleptocrats who surround him so that he fails, and he is seen to fail, and he has no opportunity to anoint his successor, and Russia fundamentally changes as a country as a consequence because the Russian people have had enough of him.

"That is something where the UK and our allies have got time to make good strategic decisions."

A former spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wants to provoke the Russian army into killing citizens to get Nato to react.

Sergei Markov, who is now deputy chairman of the Russian Public Forum on International Affairs, told Times Radio on Saturday: "He wants to provoke Russian army to use artillery for the big damages of the Ukrainian citizens."

Asked if he was suggesting that President Zelensky wants the Russian army to kill Ukrainian citizens, Mr Markov said: "Exactly. It is his main political (aim) too."

He added: "That's the major goal now - to invoke Nato to stop Russian army."

Mr Markov also said: "Russian army doesn't want to kill Ukrainian soldiers."

He then claimed that 87% of the Ukrainian army joined the Russian army in Crimea in 2014, and that with the current assault on Ukraine, "a majority of the soldiers with Ukrainian army will make decision to join Russian army".

Armed forces minister James Heappey has said Britain and other Western allies would continue to support the Ukrainians in every way they could.

"The more the Ukrainians successfully resist, the more I think they will be emboldened. People are rallying to the flag. There is every chance President Putin has bitten off more than he can chew," he told ITV.

"We, like Ukraine's other allies in the West, will continue to support them in every way we reasonably can but we have to be very clear-eyed about the size of the Russian force he has amassed against them."

Mr Heappey expressed concern that Mr Putin had gone "all in" on the invasion and warned of more "utterly brutal fighting" ahead.

"I think there is a fanaticism and a fervour in his language that is very concerning. He has gone all in on this," he said.

"He has put a huge proportion of the Russian armed forces into this campaign in Ukraine and I am very concerned that he has backed himself into a corner.

"I think you are going to see more and more utterly brutal fighting and some of Russian and Ukraine's bravest and best are going to lose their lives because of Putin's hubris."

Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who lived in St Petersburg for three years, said President Vladimir Putin has made a "terrible and deeply damaging strategic miscalculation" and "cannot win in this situation".

The Aberavon MP told BBC Breakfast: "We've got to be ready to be in this for the long haul. There will be a long insurgency against Russia if it does seek to occupy Ukraine and, in the end, Russia will lose that insurgency.

"Mr Putin has made a tremendous and terrible and deeply damaging strategic miscalculation here. He cannot win in this situation and the international community has to stand firm against."

Mr Kinnock also argued that Russian citizens do not want "to be a pariah state", saying "I lived and worked in Russia for three years in St Petersburg and the people there, they want to be a part of the international community.

"They do not want to be a pariah state. They do not want to be isolated. They want to engage with the rest of the world.

"So we have to just keep ratcheting up the pressure on Mr Putin and we have to do more to support the Ukrainian armed forces."

Armed forces minister James Heappey said Britain is continuing to press for Russia to be excluded from the Swift system of international banking payments.

Mr Heappey said it was the "ultimate economic sanction" but that more diplomacy was needed to get international agreement.

"Swift is not a unilateral decision that the UK can take," he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.

"We will continue to push with every means at out disposal - and we have encouraged parliamentarians to reach to their networks of parliamentarians around Europe - in order to change some minds.

"That really is the ultimate economic sanction. It is the one that the UK Government wants to see enacted.

"It is just clear that there is more diplomacy required before that is going to happen."

Armed forces minister James Heappey said the Ukrainian military was facing a prolonged struggle with the Russians which could carry on for months.

"Nobody should think that this is anywhere near over. What stands in front of Ukraine, its armed forces and very tragically its people, is days, weeks months more of what we have seen over that last 48 hours," he told BBC Breakfast.

"President Putin, if you listen to his speeches, look at his press conferences over the last two or three days, there has been a fanaticism in the language that he used, a fervour in the tone of his voice. He has gone all in on this.

"I am afraid that that means that what is in front of Ukraine is bloody, brutal. We will do everything we can to help them resist but people shouldn't necessarily think that a happy ending is just around the corner.

"This is going to be a long slog. It is going to be brutal. We are going to see some horrendous things on our TV screens."

Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: "Yesterday I urged NATO and Nordic partners to do all they can to support Ukraine and Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

"I am pleased even more allies have come forward with defensive and humanitarian aid. We must stand with the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and democracies everywhere."

Tobias Ellwood, Conservative chairman of the Defence Committee, said there are "huge lesson" to be learned in understanding the "wider geopolitical picture that is now changing in front of us".

The former soldier recalled serving in Bosnia, telling ITV News: "Nato wasn't part of Bosnia there, but there was a commitment to European security, and now we are playing catch-up.

"We're actually reacting to events rather than getting ahead of them. And the big question is - when do you stand up to Putin? Do you make sure that you hold him back today?

"Or do you allow him to advance and end up having a bigger battle later on when you realise what his intentions are.

"Things won't stop here. Let's make this very, very clear. Putin's ideological intention to expand his sphere of influence will go way beyond Ukraine."

Tobias Ellwood said there are "many ways" Ukraine can be assisted other than "putting in boots on the ground".

The MP told ITV News: "We need to reconsider this no-fly zone, let's say west of the Dnieper River, because that would change the optics here."

Mr Ellwood added: "If we don't stand our ground now, where will this go? And don't forget there are other adversaries around the world, namely China, watching very carefully how the West reacts here."

He said if the West is seen to be "timid" or "risk-averse" then China "will take full advantage of that weakness too".

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said almost 116,000 people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on Thursday.

It tweeted: "Latest update is that almost 116,000 have fled to neighbouring countries since 24 Feb - mainly Poland, Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia and Romania.

"Numbers are rising."

The Ministry of Defence tweeted an intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine, saying: "Russian forces have continued their advance on Kyiv with the bulk of their forces now 30km from the centre of the city.

"Russia has yet to gain control of the airspace over Ukraine, greatly reducing the effectiveness of the Russian Air Force.

"Ukrainian Armed Forces continue to put up staunch resistance across the country.

"Russian casualties are likely to be heavy and greater than anticipated or acknowledged by the Kremlin."

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have said they "stand" with the people of Ukraine as they "bravely fight" for their future.

In a personal tweet signed by the couple, they wrote: "In October 2020 we had the privilege to meet President Zelenskyy and the First Lady to learn of their hope and optimism for Ukraine's future.

"Today we stand with the President and all of Ukraine's people as they bravely fight for that future."

Home Secretary Priti Patel tweeted: "I have cancelled the visas of the Belarusian Men's Basketball Team who were due to play in Newcastle tomorrow night.

"The UK will not welcome the national sports teams of those countries who are complicit in Putin's unprovoked and illegal invasion of £Ukraine."

In Manchester, hundreds gathered in Piccadilly Gardens for a Stand For Ukraine rally.

The crowd, many wearing Ukrainian blue and yellow flags and with traditional flower headbands, sang Ukrainian songs and chanted: "Stop Putin. Stop the war."

Prayers in Ukrainian and English were led by a priest.

Many held placards with slogans including "Help victims in Ukraine", "Stop Russian Hitler" and "Putin lies, Ukraine never dies".

One woman who spoke at the rally in Manchester said her mother was Russian and her father was Ukrainian.

She said she had seen on the news that a missile had hit an apartment building in the district of Kyiv where she grew up.

She told the crowd: "It's happening now and you will be next eventually.

"Kyiv is three hours' flight from Manchester. It is Europe, we are a democratic, peaceful country.

"Why do we have war? It's only because of Putin, who is a complete nut job."

Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that he head spoken the Dutch prime minister about the situation in Ukraine: "I spoke to Mark Rutte this afternoon to thank him for strong cooperation in ensuring a supply of defensive aid to Ukraine. We discussed SWIFT and the need for urgent action to exclude Russia.

"The UK and the Netherlands are united in our condemnation of Putin's attack on Ukraine."

The Ministry of Defence tweeted an intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine, saying: "The speed of the Russian advance has temporarily slowed likely as a result of acute logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance.

"Russian forces are bypassing major Ukrainian population centres while leaving forces to encircle and isolate them.

"Overnight clashes in Kyiv are likely to have involved limited numbers of pre-positioned Russian sabotage groups.

"The capture of Kyiv remains Russia's primary military objective."

Sir Keir Starmer has called for the expulsion of Russia's ambassador to the UK following the invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking during a visit to Birmingham, the Labour leader said the Government should order Andrei Kelin to leave the country immediately.

"I think the Russian ambassador should be told to leave the country," he said in a pooled clip for broadcasters.

"Russia is invading a European country. It isn't right that he is here. He should be told to go straight away."

Sir Keir said the Government needed to move further and faster on sanctions against Russia.

"We have got to break open these companies that are supporting Putin, anybody who is supporting his regime. So we need to go further and faster on this," he said.

Sir Keir Starmer has said Britain should be prepared to take in Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion.

Speaking during a visit to Birmingham, the Labour leader said the Government has "got this one wrong" in continuing to apply existing rules for Ukranians.

"We must help Ukrainian people looking for safety. That is what we have always done as a country in a moment like this," he said in a pooled clip for broadcasters.

"The Government has got this one wrong. They are applying the same rules as they had before."

He called for a "humanitarian approach" with "sanctuary for those who are fleeing from Russian aggression, fleeing from this invasion, fleeing for their lives".

He added: "We must do more in this respect."

Sir Keir Starmer urged the Government to come forward with legislation to expose Russian oligrachs who hide their wealth by buying up property in the UK as quickly as possible.

Announcing the sanctions package in the Commons on Thursday, Boris Johnson said ministers would set out measures before Easter for a register of overseas property ownership.

Following reports that the Government was preparing to fasttrack the legislation, Sir Keir said Labour would support such a move.

"The Government says it is bringing forward primary legislation. My message to them is 'Get on with it'. We will fully support it," he in a pooled clip for broadcasters during a visit to Birmingham.

"It can go through Parliament very, very quickly. We have been calling for this legislation to break open companies to see who the real beneficiaries are for years.

"This will now go through because we will support it but it won't be enforced for months to come so I am frustrated that it has taken this long for the Government to come forward."

Police have intervened after a man holding a Russian flag close to a Ukrainian protest in London was almost punched.

The man, who had an English accent, stood across the road from the Russian embassy and was confronted by a number of protesters.

As police urged him to leave, a woman who was visibly angry shouted: "People are dying how can you support him?"

She raised a fist and swung her arm towards the man before police intervened.

The man put the flag away and left.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he has spoken by telephone with Boris Johnson and expressed gratitude for Britain's support.

Mr Zelensky tweeted: "Grateful to the British Prime Minister for his position, new decisions to enhance the combat capabilities of the Ukrainian army. Agreed on further joint steps to counter the aggressor."

Downing Street said Boris Johnson and President Zelensky "agreed on the need for the international community to isolate Russia completely diplomatically and financially".

In a statement, No 10 said: "The Prime Minister spoke to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy this evening.

"He paid tribute to the incredible heroism and bravery of President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people.

"The leaders agreed that President Putin is being met with a greater Ukrainian resistance than he calculated on.

"The Prime Minister updated on the UK's support to Ukraine and the progress rallying international partners to hold Russia to account for their campaign of destruction.

"The leaders agreed on the need for the international community to isolate Russia completely diplomatically and financially. They welcomed the increased willingness to take action on excluding Russia from SWIFT.

"The Prime Minister and President Zelenskyy expressed their mutual concern about the role Belarus is playing as a conduit for President Putin's violence. "

YouTube has announced it is taking action against a number of channels in response to Russia's assault on Ukraine, including restricting access to Russian state-controlled broadcaster RT.

In a statement on Saturday, a spokesperson said: "In light of extraordinary circumstances in Ukraine, we're taking a number of actions.

"We're pausing a number of channels' ability to monetise on YouTube, including several Russian channels affiliated with recent sanctions.

"We will be significantly limiting recommendations to these channels.

"And in response to a government request, we've restricted access to RT and a number of other channels in Ukraine.

"We will continue to monitor new developments and may take further actions."

Speaking at RAF Brize Norton, Boris Johnson said: "Let's be in no doubt, things are not going all the way of President Putin, very far from it.

"The Ukrainians are fighting heroically, and in some places with great success, as many of us thought they would because they're a great country and a very brave country.

"But as you rightly point out, there are some terrible atrocities being committed and there will be some very grim days ahead for Ukraine.

"We've got to do everything we can to change the heavy odds that Ukraine faces and to help them, and so that's why we're sending humanitarian supplies, we're sending financial supplies and military supplies as well.

"The UK was the first European country to send military aid to Ukraine. Last night, many other countries joined in sending, in pledging to send military assistance, you're starting to see that grow."

The Department of Foreign Affairs has told Irish citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Russia.

In an update to travel guidance, the Department said: "Due to the ongoing disruption to flight services to and from Russia, the Department of Foreign Affairs is advising citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Russia at this time.

"Further flight cancellations and uncertainty on travel routes from Russia are expected in the coming days.

"Citizens with plans to depart from Russia should consult closely with their airline and/or travel agent, and consider booking flights sooner than planned, in case of widening disruptions in the coming period."

Boris Johnson said President Putin's engagement in diplomacy was a "charade" and that he has a "weird, semi-mystical view of Ukraine as part of Russia".

Speaking on Saturday night, the Prime Minister said: "I think we have to face the hideous reality that the diplomacy, as far as President Putin was concerned, was a charade.

"He never really intended to alter his course. You read the article that he wrote many months ago - it was clear that he's attached to a weird, semi-mystical view of Ukraine as part of Russia.

"And that is a view that the Ukrainian people fervently, passionately reject and they're showing that they will fight to reject it.

"Our job now is to help them, to help change the very heavy odds they face and that's why we're sending the support their way."

Mr Johnson said: "You ask 'Should we do more?' The answer is yes. And we need to make sure that we apply those much tougher economic sanctions, including Swift, and what's starting to happen is that the horror of what is unfolding in Ukraine is becoming clear to Western audiences, and that is, in turn, putting huge pressure on Western politicians.

"We've got to act together and we've got to do more."

Boris Johnson said there is "fake news" online about the UK not taking refugees.

Asked why the UK is not taking in refugees like some other countries, he told reporters: "Of course we're going to take refugees. This country's had a historic and proud role in taking refugees from all conflicts.

"And if you think what we did in Afghanistan, for instance, the UK was way out in front.

"I'm aware that there's some fake news on the internet about that and I really want to knock that on the head.

"The UK is way out in front in our willingness to help with refugees.

"We've sent 1,000 troops to the theatre, to be ready to help with the influx and of course we will help people fleeing in fear of their lives."

Boris Johnson said the Swift banking system is "incredibly important" for putting economic pressure on Russia.

Asked whether the UK needs to do more to push other countries to ban Russia from Swift, Mr Johnson said: "I think that what you've seen just today is more countries joining the call of the UK to use Swift.

"Swift is the mechanism that stops people making payments to Vladimir Putin's Russia.

"It's incredibly important for tightening the ligature - the economic ligature - around the Putin regime.

"And today you've seen more and more countries, France and others, coming forward to say that they will not block a banning, a boycott of Swift."

Boris Johnson said it is "inconceivable" that sporting relations can continue with Russia under Vladimir Putin.

Asked if the UK should break off sporting connections with Russia following Poland and Sweden's refusal to play the national football team in the World Cup play-offs, Mr Johnson called the situation "sad".

"I mean, it's a sad thing because I don't think we've had a situation like this for a very, very long time," the Prime Minister said.

"But it's inconceivable to me to imagine that normal sporting relations with Putin's Russia can continue."

Asked about whether it is frustrating that countries like China abstained from the UN Security Council vote to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Boris Johnson said "outrage and disgust" is growing in countries that have so far been "apathetic".

"I think what you're seeing today, and over the last few hours, is a sense around the world that this is a horror that they simply hadn't expected," he said.

"And I think that feeling is strong and growing, not just in countries in the middle ground, but in Russia itself you're starting to see that feeling that this is something unconscionable.

"So I think (in) the countries that have been apathetic on this issue so far, a sense of of outrage and disgust is growing at what the Putin regime is doing in Ukraine.

"In the meantime, the UK is going to do everything we can to help and support our friends in Ukraine."

Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, has condemned the "barbaric actions" during Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ursula von der Leyen has announced an enhanced package of sanctions against Russia.

In a statement on Saturday, the EU Commission president said: "The Russian army is committing barbaric actions during its invasion of Ukraine.

"It is bombing and launching missiles, killing innocent people.

"At the same time, the entire world is witnessing the determined and brave resistance by the Ukrainian army and population."

The UK has agreed with the EU and US to cut some Russian banks out of the Swift banking system.

A statement issued by the White House said: "We, the leaders of the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States condemn Putin's war of choice and attacks on the sovereign nation and people of Ukraine. We stand with the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people in their heroic efforts to resist Russia's invasion. Russia's war represents an assault on fundamental international rules and norms that have prevailed since the Second World War, which we are committed to defending. We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin.

"This past week, alongside our diplomatic efforts and collective work to defend our own borders and to assist the Ukrainian government and people in their fight, we, as well as our other allies and partners around the world, imposed severe measures on key Russian institutions and banks, and on the architects of this war, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, we are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies. We will implement these measures within the coming days.

"Specifically, we commit to undertake the following measures:

"First, we commit to ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system. This will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally.

"Second, we commit to imposing restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions.

Third, we commit to acting against the people and entities who facilitate the war in Ukraine and the harmful activities of the Russian government. Specifically, we commit to taking measures to limit the sale of citizenship-so called golden passports-that let wealthy Russians connected to the Russian government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems.

Fourth, we commit to launching this coming week a transatlantic task force that will ensure the effective implementation of our financial sanctions by identifying and freezing the assets of sanctioned individuals and companies that exist within our jurisdictions. As a part of this effort we are committed to employing sanctions and other financial and enforcement measures on additional Russian officials and elites close to the Russian government, as well as their families, and their enablers to identify and freeze the assets they hold in our jurisdictions. We will also engage other governments and work to detect and disrupt the movement of ill-gotten gains, and to deny these individuals the ability to hide their assets in jurisdictions across the world.

"Finally, we will step up or co-ordination against disinformation and other forms of hybrid warfare."

Ms von der Leyen said: "As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, we are resolved to continue imposing massive costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies.

"In co-ordination with President Biden, President Macron, Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Prime Minister Draghi as well as Prime Minister Trudeau and Prime Minister Johnson, we considered a significant tightening of our international response.

"The European Union and its partners are working to cripple Putin's ability to finance his war machine."

Ms von der Leyen told the news conference: "I will now propose to EU leaders the following measures.

"First, we commit to ensuring that a certain number of Russian banks are removed from Swift. This will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally.

"Swift is the world's dominant global interbank payment system. Cutting banks off will stop them from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and effectively block Russian exports and imports.

"Second, we will stop Putin from using his war chest. We will paralyse the assets of Russia's central bank. This will freeze its transactions and it will make it impossible for the central bank to liquidate assets.

"And finally, we will work to prohibit Russian oligarchs from using their financial assets on our markets. All of these measures will significantly harm Putin's ability to finance his war and they will have an eroding, a severely eroding, impact on his economy.

"Putin embarked on a path aiming to destroy Ukraine but what he's also doing, in fact, is destroying the future of his own country."

BORIS JOHNSON SAYS WEST IS 'TIGHTENING THE ECONOMIC LIGATURE' AROUND RUSSIA

Boris Johnson has said the West is "tightening the economic ligature" around Vladimir Putin's Russia as allies unveiled new measures to hit its financial system.

In a co-ordinated move Britain, the US, Canada and the European Union announced selected Russian banks would be excluded from the Swift global payments system.

At the same time they said the would be imposing "restrictive measures" to prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves "in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions".

After talking by telephone to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr Johnson said the West had to do everything possible to change the "very heavy odds" against Ukraine in its struggle against Moscow's forces.

He confirmed Britain would be sending further arms to the Ukrainians and he said that the financial measures were essential to put pressure on the Kremlin.

"It is incredibly important for tightening the economic ligature around the Putin regime," he told broadcasters during a visit to RAF Brize Norton.

Earlier German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced he was dropping his country's opposition to the move removing a major obstacle to international agreement.

"The horror of what is unfolding in Ukraine is becoming clear to Western audiences and that in turn is putting huge pressure on Western politicians," Mr Johnson said.

He said that while the Ukrainian forces were fighting "heroically", it was clear that some "terrible atrocities" had been committed and the country faced some "grim days" to come.

Britain had been pressing for action on Swift - described by one minister as the "ultimate economic sanction" - for some time.

Germany and Italy - which both rely heavily on Russia oil and gas imports - were among the countries said to be reluctant.

The move came on the day the expected Russian assault on the the Ukrainian capital Kyiv failed to materialise.

Despite skirmishing in the outskirts of the city, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in its latest intelligence assessment that the Russian advance had "temporarily slowed".

With the main Russia armoured columns reported to be 30 kilometres (19 miles) from the centre of Kyiv, the MoD said the delay was likely to be the result of "acute logistics problems" as well as the strength of Ukrainian resistance.

The city's defenders remained braced however for an onslaught - possibly as early as Sunday - once the Russians have refuelled and re-supplied.

Mr Johnson said: "Let's be in no doubt, things are not going all the way of President Putin, very far from it.

"The Ukrainians are fighting heroically, and in some places with great success, as many of us thought they would because they're a great country and a very brave country.

"But there are some terrible atrocities being committed and there will be some very grim days ahead for Ukraine."

In one of his regular video messages, President Zelensky said the "real fighting" for Kyiv was ongoing, as he accused Russia in a video message of hitting infrastructure and civilian targets.

"We will win," he said.

Earlier it emerged that he had refused an American offer to evacuate, insisting: "The fight is here."

However, Armed Forces minister James Heappey disclosed that the Ministry of Defence was working on plans to support a resistance movement and a government in exile if Ukraine was finally overrun.

"That is a decision for the National Security Council to take but it is something that the Prime Minister has asked us in the Ministry of Defence to look at and plan for," he told Sky News.

On Friday, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace convened a meeting with 25 other donor nations who all agreed to supply arms or humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

Britain has already sent 2,000 anti-tank missile launchers and Mr Heappy said officials were looking to get more weaponry to the country.

"We know what the Ukrainians want. We are doing our best to get it to them," he said.

For Labour, shadow foreign secretary David Lammy welcomed the the agreement with the US and EU to move on Swift.

""Vladimir Putin's rogue regime must face the toughest possible sanctions as a consequence of its illegal invasion of Ukraine," he said.

"The UK Government should come forward with further sanctions to effectively cut off the Russian state from our economic system."

SWIFT's red button closer for Russia: a key country gave Putin the thumbs-down

Despite the wide range of restrictions imposed by various countries on Russia due to its military invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin 's army continues its advance and is closing in on Kiev, the country's capital. However, one sanction that could put the Kremlin in check is looming ever closer: its removal from SWIFT, the world's largest interbank payment system.

Now, Italy has added its approval to Russia's exclusion from SWIFT, which implies an important step for Ukraine due to the strong economic ties Italy has with Russia and which previously positioned the government led by Mario Draghi against this measure.

Russia - Ukraine war, LIVE | Moscow accused Kiev of ruining the truce by refusing to negotiate

Why it is war between Russia and Ukraine: what happened in 2014

This was reported by the President of Ukraine, Volodymir Zelensky, through his social networks: "This is the beginning of a new page in the history of our states, Italy and Ukraine. In a telephone conversation, Mario Draghi supported Russia's disengagement from SWIFT," the Ukrainian leader informed.

He added that "the provision of defense assistance" was also negotiated with Draghi. The message published on Twitter concludes with an eloquent request: for Ukraine to join the European Union as a member.

Draghi's decision is a major step towards finally defining Russia's removal from SWIFT as Italy was one of the four nations - along with Germany, Hungary and Cyprus - that initially requested in the European Union that Putin's exclusion from SWIFT not be included in the package of sanctions on the Kremlin.

WHAT DOES REMOVING RUSSIA FROM SWIFT ENTAIL AND WHY DO SOME COUNTRIES OPPOSE IT? The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, SWIFT, is the world's largest high-security network, connecting thousands of financial institutions globally.

Applying the "nuclear option" of this system to Russia, which implies making all transactions between its banks totally impossible, would virtually eliminate Vladimir Putin 's government from the international banking system.

What is SWIFT and why it is key to Russia's most sought-after punishment

War in Ukraine: why do Russian tanks have the letter Z on them?

Disconnecting Russia from SWIFT would result in a strong impact on its economy and the Russian currency because, if money transfers are cut off, the Kremlin will no longer be able to sell oil, gas and raw materials to Europe, its main business.

To illustrate, Russia's earnings from oil and gas exports account for more than 40% of its revenues. In fact, in 2020 Russia accounted for 1.5% of transactions on the SWIFT platform.

However, the sanction that Zelenski is anxiously awaiting is not easy to take and is presented as a double-edged sword for many European economies: if Russia cannot sell raw materials, its main buyer countries will be left without them, which would imply a brake on their economies in an international context of high inflation and the need for productive recovery after two years of pandemic.

To give a blunt figure: the gas pipelines managed by Russia provide up to 40% of European gas consumption. Thus, as an official in the upper house of the Russian parliament said this week, if Russia is disconnected from SWIFT, it will not receive foreign currency, but "the buyers, the European countries in the first place, will not receive their goods: oil, gas, metals and other important components".

It would also be a blow to European banks, which are the most exposed to Russia. Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International , France's Societe Generale and Italy's Unicredit are among the most complicated.

Italian Premier Mario Draghi has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to make clear the Italian government supports any moves to cut Russia off from the SWIFT international payment system.

A day earlier, Draghi’s finance minister raised doubts Italy would go along with such a move because that would complicate payments to the Russians for natural gas. Italy gets some 45% of its gas from Russia.

Draghi’s office said the premier told Zelenskyy that Italy “will supply Ukraine with assistance to defend itself.”

WHAT IS SWIFT AND WHY DOES THE UK WANT RUSSIAN BANKS EXCLUDED FROM IT?

Britain, the US, Canada and the European Union have announced that selected Russian banks would be excluded from the Swift global payments system.

Boris Johnson and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky both welcomed the "increased willingness" to take action against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.

Here, the PA news agency answers key questions about Swift and why the issue is so important.

- What is Swift?

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) is a secure messaging system used by financial institutions to move money around the world.

Instead of holding or transferring funds, Swift allows banks and companies to alert each other of transactions that are about to take place.

- Who uses it?

The platform, founded in the 1970s, connects more than 11,000 banking and securities organisations, market infrastructures and corporate customers in more than 200 countries and territories.

It averaged 42 million messages daily last year to enable payments, with about half of all high-value transactions crossing national borders going through it.

- Why is it being mentioned following Russia's invasion of Ukraine?

It is the latest announcement following a number of sanctions that have hit Russia.

The Prime Minister told broadcasters during a visit to RAF Brize Norton: "It is incredibly important for tightening the economic ligature around the Putin regime."

The move has been described by Armed forces minister James Heappey as the "ultimate economic sanction".

- Why does the UK want Russia to be excluded?

Banning Russian banks from the platform would hit the country's access to financial markets across the world.

This would cause delays and extra costs for the Russian economy, and would make it harder for other countries to make payments to Russia.

- Why has this only been announced?

Russia is the European Union's main provider of oil and natural gas

Reports suggested there were fears among countries - including Germany, Italy and France - that banning Russia would push up prices and cut off their oil and gas supply.

The Netherlands and Germany are also key trading partners with Russia, which is a big buyer of manufactured goods.

US President Joe Biden has also been hesitant.

- What could Russia do?

It is possible banning Russia from Swift will not cut it off from the global economy as strongly as believed.

One concern is that Russia could turn to an alternative system, potentially one developed by China, which could erode the power of the US dollar.

They could even turn to tools like telephone, telex or email to engage in bank-to-bank transactions.

In 2019, then-Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said losing access to Swift would be seen as a declaration of war against the country.

- Have any other countries been excluded and what happened?

The measure has been used before, when Iran was blocked from the system due to its nuclear programme in 2012.

The country reportedly lost half of its oil export revenues and 30% of its foreign trade.

It was also considered an option in 2014, when Russia invaded and annexed Ukraine's Crimea and backed separatist forces in eastern areas of the country.

Germany and Italy close airspace to Russia over Ukraine invasion

Germany and Italy will close their airspace to Russian aircraft, as already announced by many other European countries, because of Russia' s aggression against Ukraine.

"The Ministry of Transport decreed a flight ban for Russian aircraft and aircraft operators in German airspace," it said, specifying that it will remain in force for three months, although it does not refer to any humanitarian flights. This measure will be applied from 14:00 GMT this Sunday (11:00 Argentinean time).

Italy also announced similar measures. "Italy is closing its airspace to Russia," a government spokesman said this Sunday in a forceful manner.

France for the moment only indicated that it plans to apply the same sanction.

Earlier, Belgium followed suit through its prime minister, Alexander De Croo.

"Belgium decided to close its airspace to all Russian airlines. European skies are open skies. They are open for those who connect people, not for those who seek to brutally assault," tweeted De Croo.

The same measure was announced by Luxembourg, a small country but one that serves as a major hub for air cargo.

Earlier in the day, Finland and Denmark announced the closure of their airspaces to Russians.

With more than 1,300 kilometers of border with Russia, Finland "is preparing to close airspace to Russian air traffic," Transport Minister Timo Harraka said in a tweet posted early Sunday.

The minister did not specify when the measure will come into force.

For his part, Jeppe Kofod, Danish foreign minister, noted on Twitter that his country will also "close its airspace to Russian aircraft."

"At today's meeting of EU foreign ministers we will push for an EU-wide ban," Kofod added.

Russia, for its part, applies reciprocity.

Italy’s Luxury Industry Denies Seeking Russian Sanction Exemptions

MILAN — Milan Fashion Week kicked off just as Vladimir Putin ordered the attack on Ukraine, leaving the industry rattled by the news and the city a stage for several protests in support of the beleaguered country, also outside show venues.

Fake news started to circulate, such as a report that Italy had made a request for carve-outs on sanctions, including for luxury goods, which was firmly denied by an official tweet from Palazzo Chigi, the seat of the country’s Council of Ministers and the official residence of the country’s Prime Minister Mario Draghi.

“We represent all fashion brands and we have not done any kind of lobbying – the government will decide on the measures to take and we will abide by them and adapt to whatever restriction is decided upon,” said Carlo Capasa, president of the Camera della Moda. “At this moment, what is important is the life of people and peace. Actually, we hope that the message that fashion launches about peace, coexistence, inclusivity and social sustainability will make inroads.”

Just as the pandemic was all fashion week goers could talk about two years ago when it first hit Milan, the war was top of mind for everyone this season, culminating with Putin launching an atomic threat on Sunday, while the members of the EU were meeting to map out sanctions to hit Russia. Putin also agreed on Sunday to hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday on the border of Ukraine and the Russian satellite state Belarus, although battles continued to rage.

Zelensky said on Saturday Draghi had supported Russia’s disconnection from the global SWIFT payment system.

Giorgio Armani, for one, took a strong stance by deciding to hold his signature brand’s show on Sunday without a soundtrack “as a sign of respect for the unfolding tragedy,” it was announced as the lights dimmed on the runway.

“A few hours before the show, I thought what can I do for what’s happening around us?” wondered the designer at his Via Borgonuovo headquarters after the show.

“It’s not sending money or clothes, nothing like that. How could I express how my heart was beating for these children…” he began to say before tearing up. After a few moments, he resumed his comments by saying that he believed “the best thing is to give a signal that we are not happy, that we don’t want to celebrate because there is something around us that troubles us very much. So I told my team, ‘I don’t want any music.’ In the room, you could hear the absence of music, and backstage, it was more emotional than if any music, rap or rock had played.”

Before his MSGM show, Massimo Giorgetti also expressed how he pushed himself to focus on his work as the war raged. “We must go on,” he said, adding that, while social media was awash with comments, he also debated on ways to express his feelings.

“We were beginning to finally see some blue sky after the pandemic, with more people traveling, and now black clouds loom over the future,” said Nicolas Girotto, chief executive officer of Bally. “We are caught in a vortex and we are concerned for our team members who have relatives in the region.”

Russia is a small business for the Swiss brand, but the CEO shared his concerns for the repercussions on the economy. “We were not expecting this and it’s difficult to make any kind of forecast, but I see the restrictions and the sanctions lasting in time.”

Capasa said Italian exports to Russia represent a business of 1.2 billion euros on a total of 100 billion euros. “The weight of the country varies depending on the company and the effect of the sanctions will be asymmetric, hitting some brands more than others, but none of them has placed business ahead of humanitarian actions. We are sure that our government, with the European Union, will find the right way to cope with this. We have good business relationships with Ukraine and Russia and nobody wants the war, I can assure you,” he underscored.

While declining to provide any financial information about business in Russia as a leader of a public company, Gildo Zegna, chairman and CEO of the Zegna Group, echoed Capasa’s words. “I comply with the president’s stance. This will not be an easy situation but if we are united, we will come out of it, but it is premature to venture into any prediction.”

 

 

According to association Confindustria, Russia represented 2.7 percent of Italian exports in 2014, the year of the first sanctions for the annexing of Crimea. Today, exports to Russia involve more than 11,000 companies. The diminishing weight of the Russian market, as a consequence of those sanctions, hit several sectors, such as apparel, which represents 7.3 percent of the total, a 3.8 percent decrease compared to pre-2014. Leather goods now account for 4.6 percent of the total, down 1.7 percent.

Sanctions weakened the economic growth and the internal Russian demand and devalued the ruble. In terms of imports, around one-fifth of Italy’s gas and oil comes from Russia.

Confindustria stated that Russia has drawn 2.4 percent of Italian capital invested in the world, channeled in 442 local branches employing around 34,700 people and producing revenues of 7.4 billion euros, a 7.5 percent growth in the past six years. This surpasses the growth in the countries outside the European Union, up 2.2 percent in the same period, and in the U.S., up 5.2 percent.

Simona Clemenza, CEO of Aspesi, said Russia is not one of the main markets for the brand, which is stronger in Asia and Europe, but she is expecting an impact from the sanctions at a general level. “They are a price that we will all have to pay,” she said.

Like her peers, she said there are still uncertainties about the information circulating. Asked about the recent increase in the cost of energy and raw materials, Clemenza said the company has worked to “mitigate the effect through the optimization of certain industrial processes as to maintain Aspesi in the range of an alternative to luxury, but the effects will be felt on the current year.”

At the Budapest Select, showing at the Fashion Hub supported by the Camera Nazionale della Moda, asking to speak anonymously, a guest hailing from Hungary was especially concerned about the possible repercussions of the war. “Hungary is in the middle, between Russia and Ukraine and shares 100 kilometers of a common border, there are many Hungarians living in Ukraine,” she said, fearing Hungary could be the next to suffer an invasion, although the country’s prime minister has said the country will not send its army to fight in Ukraine.

“For the past two days, I’ve felt this pressure on my chest; we don’t know what will happen. We were almost out of COVID-19 and now this. In 2022, the war cannot be a solution. All businesses will be affected, the currency, and so on. We have many collaborations with the Russians, everyone is worried. But we care for the refugees we expect will be coming to Hungary and we are getting ready to welcome them.”

“This will be a European disaster for all its sectors,” said Olga Peredenko, a buyer for a fashion store in Kyiv. “Our sector will make no sense if this war does not stop soon, and the consequences will be felt for a very long time. The pre-collection orders will not be confirmed and the summer merchandise will be canceled, too,” she said, while obviously more concerned about the humanitarian crisis.

She explained that it was easier for Russia to annex Crimea because the region has long been a tourist area where former members of the USSR army lived or retired, while Ukraine has long resisted being part of Russia.

“Putin considers the dissolution of the USSR last century’s geopolitical catastrophe. He could be eyeing Moldova next.”

Asked if she was surprised by the many expressions of support for her country seen in Italy over the past few days, Peredenko said Italy has long been the home of many Ukrainians, whether employed as models or caregivers for the elderly, for example. She herself moved to Italy in 1994 and, after years as a model, started as a luxury buyer working with several countries, including Russia and Kazakhstan, for example, with about 80 clients. “This war is the opposite of common sense and is unacceptable. And it will have significant repercussions on the Italian economy if it is not stopped soon.”

(Clip of protesting people in support of Ukraine.)

GAYLE KING: Welcome back to CBS this morning, these people in the U.S. and around the world are standing in solidarity with Ukraine.

A different kind of global resistance is damaging Russia`s economy, leading many Russians to line up at their banks to get their money out. The U.S. and its European allies have agreed to keep those banks out of a financial system. It`s called SWIFT hoping to put more pressure on Russia`s government.

Also, the Treasury Department has just imposed a new sanction to stop the Russian government Central Bank from reaching any of its assets it has here in this country.

CBS News business analyst, Jill Schlesinger is here to explain the importance of SWIFT.

Good morning to you, Jill.

I`m so glad you`re here because I had never even heard of SWIFT until this weekend.

JILL SCHLESINGER: You are not alone. Good morning.

Well, SWIFT is the secure messaging system that underpins the movement of money across borders. While SWIFT is not a payment system, it is how banks make transfer requests to one another, and it has become essential in the global economy, handling millions of daily requests.

So when Russia exports natural gas to Europe, payment requests for that transaction are made through SWIFT, and when Western banks are owed money from Russian-based entities, they too would use SWIFT.

Excluding Russian banks from SWIFT could make it difficult, if not impossible for Russian companies to get paid for goods and services. Though it remains unclear if the SWIFT measures will impact energy products at this time.

But these measures, they essentially isolate the world`s 12th largest economy. Ordinary Russian citizens will not be able to buy products like iPhones from the U.S., cheese from France, luxury goods from Italy. And for those who invest, the Russian stock market has lost a third of its value over the past week.

Critically, Russia`s expulsion from Swift will also mean that Russians are cut off financially from their families who live abroad.

So Tony, this is a big move among the international community.

TONY DOKOUPIL: It is a big move and if you`ve got rubles this morning, you are not feeling too good financially.

Thank you very much, Jill.

As we was just mentioned, the sanctions on Russia have not stopped President Vladimir Putin, at least not yet.

Over the weekend, he put his nuclear forces on high alert raising new fears of a nuclear war. For more on all of it, let`s go now to a retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman.

Lieutenant Colonel, good morning to you. You have a unique cross section of expertise here. You`re born in Ukraine, came to America as a three-year- old, rose to positions of expertise as the person specializing in Russia for the Joint Chiefs of Staff in our government, and then the National Security Council. So few people know more than you from all sides of the equation.

I`m curious at this point, how we get out of a dynamic where everyone says we have to stop Vladimir Putin, but everyone also acknowledges that sanctions are not enough.

So what more needs to be done, what can be done?

LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN (RET) (U.S. Army): So Vladimir Putin is hoping through his nuclear saber rattling that he`ll put us back on our heels, they`ll get us to be deeply concerned about this potential for nuclear escalation. But of course, for those in government, they understand the history is we`ve had to deal with this threat throughout the Cold War, throughout the Soviet period for generations, for a couple of generations and that we had to respond to Russia`s belligerence and stayed firm in supporting our National Security interests.

So that`s part of it, it is just not to bend because of the nuclear saber rattling because we`ve seen it before.

But the other thing we need to do is we need to indicate that his actions have severe consequences. On the economic scale, we`ve never executed anything like this.

For all intents and purposes, Russia`s economy is isolated. There will still be some energy flows because Europe relies on them, but it`s an isolated economy. It is going to have a devastating impact.

And then on the military landscape, which is particularly acute at the moment, the provisioning of Ukraine with lethal assistance, including these former Soviet era aircraft are going to be extremely important as Ukraine`s Air Force has been significantly degraded.

The provision of anti-tank capabilities, the provision of air defense capabilities, but there is more that we need to be doing. We need to provide UAVs that have been highly effective, these unmanned aerial vehicles that strike deep targets.

But that`s probably where we need to go before we really start to force Vladimir Putin to thinking about off ramps. He is the one that initiated this war. He`s the one that`s going to make the first signals that he is willing to go head in a different direction, but we are far from that point still.

TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, we hope we get to that point, Colonel. I have a quick follow up on the nuclear sable rattling. I hear you saying we shouldn`t be concerned. He has done this in the past. But there are others saying that he is not the same Vladimir Putin he was five to 10 years ago, he has changed.

What makes you think from where you`re sitting that he is still a rational actor? And I think you know what I mean by that.

LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN (RET): Yes, but hasn`t changed. He is not a madman, he`s not suicidal. He`s actually been increasingly incrementally increasing his aggression against the West for years.

I mean, he has nuclear grade materials to poison adversaries, chemical weapons. He has targeted U.S. forces with bounties. He has conducted multiple wars. And the problem is that he hasn`t faced a significant reaction.

Now, he is facing that reaction. This is something that he is unaccustomed to, but he`s not a madman, and he is going to, once he realizes that this is legit, this has a major bite and he is not achieving his military objectives in Ukraine. He`s going to look for other ways to achieve his aims in the long run. Thank you.

NATE BURLESON: Colonel, in a recent op-ed in "The Atlantic," you said that Biden granted Putin a free hand. How so?

LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN (RET): Well, it`s really multiple administrations, 20 years of failed policy, and what that did was that kind of put blinders on to the broader landscape with regards to Ukraine. So what you have is the administration kind of looking at Russia through a soda straw. Within that soda straw, the Biden administration has leaned very far forward. They are on the leading edge of these sanctions, they`re not providing weapons.

But there is more that could have been done. We could see now the catastrophe that this war is and that the likelihood of being limited and the U.S. stays out of it cleanly, or Europe stays out of it cleanly is unrealistic.

So my critique was mainly to learn from our mistakes, to stop an incrementalist`s approach, and to really start providing the kind of support to Ukraine that they need. So that`s not the $350 million that the U.S., promised, but an order of magnitude bigger, $3.5 billion and start thinking about a $35 billion yet.

GAYLE KING: Colonel, I wanted to talk to you about the Ukrainian people.

LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN (RET): Sorry.

GAYLE KING: No, it`s okay. Many people are in awe and in awe of the resolve and the determination of the Ukrainian people. I saw an interview with the Mayor of Kyiv, who said we are oppressed, but we are not depressed, which I thought was very powerful.

Based on what you know about Ukraine and its people, what do you make of how they`re handling this?

LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN (RET): It`s amazing. They are a shining example for the entire world. Certainly, our own population here in the U.S. is drawn to it. We always love the underdog story, but it is more than that. This is a resilient, tough people, fighting for their freedom, fighting for democracy, fighting for their homes.

And the Russians were certainly not prepared for it. They had some false assumptions and they are being ground down on those battlefields in Ukraine. But it`s an amazing people, some population that I`ve gotten a chance to know, that is in my blood also, for that matter and I`m very, very proud to call myself a Ukrainian-American.

TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes, they are more afraid of losing their country and their independence than they are of losing their lives, and so they fight. Colonel Vindman, thank you very much.

LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN (RET): Thank you.

TONY DOKOUPIL: We will be right back.

How SWIFT became weapon in finance war with Russia

Global system delivers 40 million payment orders to 11,500 banks and other financial institutions every day

The West's sanctions campaign against Russia reached a new and unprecedented level over the weekend, when the United States, Canada, Britain and the European Union agreed to overcome their internal divisions and cut some Russian banks out of SWIFT – the heart of the global payments network.

They made the announcement as Russian forces surrounded Kyiv and heavy fighting was reported in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-biggest city.

The European Commission said the move, on top of ratcheted-up sanctions on Russia's financial system, businesses, oligarchs and the denizens of the Kremlin itself, was designed to ensure the invasion of Ukraine is a “strategic failure." European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, “Cutting banks off will stop them from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and effectively block Russian exports and imports."

Will it? While there is no doubt the SWIFT weapon will inflict a lot of pain, it is unlikely on its own to deliver a death blow to the banks.

What is SWIFT?

SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication . It has been around since the 1970s, operates as a co-operative and is based in Belgium. SWIFT is often inaccurately described as a payments system; it actually delivers payment messages as if it were a kind of glorified, secure and fast telex system. SWIFT is massive. It delivers some 40 million payment orders to 11,500 banks and other financial institutions every day, and works on mutual trust.

What is SWIFT's reputation as a weapon of mass financial destruction?

Formidable, or at least that is its image. Cutting banks out of SWIFT has often been called the “nuclear" option, as if doing so were guaranteed to flatten them.

In 2014, when Russia seemed on the verge of exclusion from SWIFT for having annexed Crimea, Alexei Kudrin , a former Russian finance minister, forecast that the sanction would shrink GDP by 5 per cent. The then-prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev , said it would be tantamount to “a declaration of war."

Iran in 2012 was cut out of SWIFT and the pain was fast and furious.

After its banks were disconnected, the country lost almost half of its oil export revenue and 30 per cent of its foreign trade, according to Maria Shagina, a sanctions expert who is a visiting fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.

If eliminating SWIFT would be so effective, what was the resistance to using it against Russia?

Because SWIFT works both ways.

The targeted banks would not be able to make payments, but also would not be able to receive payments. This scenario terrified the European countries that imported a lot of Russian gas, notably Germany and Italy. The Kremlincontrolled gas giant Gazprom uses SWIFT to receive payments from the utilities in those countries. Evidently, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi feared Gazprom would turn off the taps if its payments went missing.

Missing gas was only one worry.

Germany, Italy and Austria all have close trade relationships with Russia. Payment for everything from German BMWs to Italian fashion brands could be at risk. Paolo Gentiloni, the EU 's trade commissioner, said Europe “would pay a price" for the various sanctions, including reduced sales in Russia and rising energy costs.

How did the countries in favour of whacking the Russian banks convince the doubters?

Not all Russian banks will get the SWIFT-less treatment (though Sberbank , the country's biggest retail bank, would). It appears that certain energy-related banks would remain locked into SWIFT to allow payments for gas and oil deliveries to continue, perhaps with some restrictions. Mr. Draghi made it clear even before Russia launched the invasion on Thursday that he did not want Russian energy to be part of the West's sanctions package.

Will Russia truly suffer without access to SWIFT?

Probably less so than it would have several years ago. Russian President Vladimir Putin has no doubt been preparing for this moment since 2014, when the SWIFT threat first emerged. Besides ensuring that Russia had ample foreign reserves and a low debt-to-GDP ratio, the country created a SWIFT clone called the System for Transfer of Financial Messages, which is similar to China's version, the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System. The Russian one is small; in 2020, only about 400 financial institutions in 23 countries used it. If Russia and China worked together, they might be able to build a viable competitor to SWIFT, but that would take years. Mr. Putin and his Kremlin finance wizards may have other workarounds that we don't even know about to offset the loss of SWIFT.

Could the sanctions on Russia's central bank inflict even more damage than eliminating SWIFT?

Yes, for sure. The new sanctions on the central bank are aimed at freezing its foreign exchange reserves of US$630-billon, equivalent to 38 per cent of GDP, held in various Western currencies and assets, including gold. These holdings are scattered everywhere, some of them in countries that will enforce the sanctions.

Hitting the central bank is an enormous blow to Russia. It would, for instance, severely limit its ability to use foreign cash to prop up the sagging ruble. That sanction, combined with cutting the banks out of SWIFT, might prove devastating to Russia's banks and economy. The question is how Russia will retaliate.

UPDATE 6: UK slaps sanctions on RDIF, CEO Kirill Dmitriev

ROME/PARIS/LONDON/WARSAW/GENEVA/MOSCOW/WASHINGTON/BERLIN, Mar 1 (PRIME) -- The U.K. has imposed sanctions on the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) and his CEO Kirill Dmitriev over the Russian military operation in Ukraine, as seen by PRIME in the sanction list published on Tuesday.

The sanctions encompass a freeze of assets of the fund and a ban on entry to the U.K. as well as an asset freeze for Dmitriev.

The Canadian government said in a statement that it will ban entry to the country’s ports or inland waters for all vessels and fishing ships owned by Russia or are registered in the country. The ban will come in force later this week, the authority said.

Italy suggested slapping new sanctions on the Russian oligarchs with assets over 10 million euros, Prime Minister Mario Draghi told national parliament

“Italy is ready for further restrictions (against Russia) if necessary. In particular, I would like to suggest taking further targeted measures against the oligarchs. My idea is that we create a public international register of those people whose assets exceed 10 million euros,” he said.

The Italian government is now working to reduce dependency on Russia with the first step being higher natural gas imports from other suppliers like Algeria and Azerbaijan. Other measures include a wider use of liquefied natural gas and a temporary increase of production of power from burning of fuel oil and coal, he said.

In case of disruptions of Russian gas supplies, Italy stands to lose more than other European countries, but this fact has no impact on its decision to slap sanctions on Moscow. The Ukrainian conflict will make power for the households costlier, and the government should offer new support measures for the households and companies, Draghi said.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the U.K. had more options to toughen sanctions against Russia’s top bank Sberbank and to freeze Russian assets.

Bloomberg reported quoting an E.U. draft proposal that the union was discussing a shut-off of seven Russian banks from the international interbank settlement system SWIFT, including VTB Bank, Bank Rossiya, Otkritie Financial Corporation (FC) Bank, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Sovcombank, and VEB.RF, while Gazprombank and Sberbank were not on the list.

But Robert Habeck, the German minister for economic affairs and climate action, told reporters that narrow channels within the SWIFT would be provided to Russia that would be used for settlements that would still be necessary for the E.U.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) said in a statement that its board of directors voted for indefinite suspension to the bank’s finances to Russia and Belarus.

The European Parliament approved a recommendation calling for restrictions of Russian oil and natural gas imports to the E.U., a ban on investment from the E.U. in Russia, a shut-off of all Russian banks from the European financial system, and exclusion of the country from the SWIFT.

French energy giant TotalEnergies in a statement supported the E.U. sanctions and promised to comply with them. The company will mobilize its support of Ukraine to ensure provision of fuel to the country, support of the Ukrainian refugees in Europe, and will not invest in any new projects in Russia, the company said.

British Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps said on his Twitter page that the U.K. had also approved a law banning entry to the British ports for any vessel with any relation to Russia.  Polish Foreign Minister and Organization for Security Cooperation and Europe (OSCE) Chairman-in-Office Zbigniew Rau said that the E.U. would impose more sanctions on Russia if the military operation in Ukraine continues.

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Office’s spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell said that the anti-Russian sanctions should not restrict the rights of individuals, even though she had no confirmation about discriminations of Russians on the basis of their nationality.

BOARD REPORT

COMPANY HISTORY AND PURPOSE

History

Iveco Group N.V. (the "Company" and together with its subsidiaries the "Iveco Group" or the "Group") was incorporated as a public limited company (naamloze vennootschap) under the laws of the Netherlands on 16 June 2021. The Company's corporate seat is in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and its principal office and business address is Via Puglia n. 35, Turin, Italy. The Company is registered with the trade register of the Chamber of Commerce of the Netherlands (Kamer van Koophandel) under number 83102701. The Netherlands is the Company's home member state for the purposes of the EU Transparency Directive (Directive 2004/109/EC, as amended by Directive 2013/50/EU), as a consequence of which the Company will be subject to the DFSA in respect of certain ongoing transparency and disclosure obligations.

The Company, 100% owned by CNH Industrial N.V. ("CNH Industrial" and together with its subsidiaries the "CNH Industrial Group") upon incorporation, was formed in the context of the separation of the Commercial and Specialty Vehicles business, the Powertrain business as well as the related Financial Services business (together the "Iveco Group Business") from CNH Industrial N.V.. The separation was realized in accordance with Section 2:334a (3) of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) by way of a legal statutory demerger (juridische afsplitsing) (the "Demerger"). The Demerger became effective on 1 January 2022 (the "Effective Date"), and the Company ultimately began to act as a holding for the Iveco Group, also providing for central treasury activity in the interest of Group's subsidiaries.

As part of the Demerger and by operation of law, each holder of common shares in the share capital of CNH Industrial (the CNH Common Shares) received one Common Share for every five CNH Common Shares held (the Allotment Ratio) on 31 December 2021 (the Demerger Record Date) (such holder of CNH Common Shares on the Demerger Record Date being a CNH Shareholder). Each CNH Shareholder that, in addition to holding CNH Common Shares, was registered in the loyalty register of CNH Industrial (the CNH Loyalty Register) was registered in the loyalty register of the Company (the Loyalty Register) for the corresponding number of Common Shares pursuant to the Allotment Ratio. If such CNH shareholder also held CNH Special Voting Shares, it, by operation of law, received a number of Special Voting Shares equal to the number of Common Shares for which it was registered in the Loyalty Register (the receipt of Common Shares and, if applicable, Special Voting Shares by CNH Shareholders as part of the Demerger being the Share Allocation). If such CNH Shareholder was registered in the CNH Loyalty Register electing to receive CNH Special Voting Shares upon completion of the required holding, it also is registered in the Loyalty Register electing to receive Special Voting Shares upon completion of the required holding period, whereby the holding period to receive Special Voting Shares shall be shortened by the period of time by which such holder of Common Shares had already been registered in the CNH Loyalty Register. Following the Demerger (and as a result of the same), CNH Shareholders at the Demerger Record Date were the shareholders of two independent public companies: CNH Industrial and the Company.

On 3 January 2022, the Company's common shares started trading on Euronext Milan (previously named the Mercato Telematico Azionario), a regulated market operated by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. in Milan, Italy. Effective from the Demerger, the Company is not anymore owned by CNH Industrial. All shares in the Company issued upon incorporation to CNH Industrial were cancelled as part of the Demerger. As a result of the listing, the company became a Dutch Public Interest Entity (OOB) on 3 January 2022.

During 2021, the Company only incurred certain expenses, principally relating to legal and professional services in connection with its start-up activities as future holding and treasury of the Iveco Group, without performing any other activities.

Purpose

Starting from the Demerger, the Company is the holding of the Iveco Group, engaged in the design, production, marketing, sale, servicing, and financing of trucks, commercial vehicles, buses and specialty vehicles for firefighting, defense and civil protection, as well as combustion engines, alternative propulsion systems, transmissions and axles for those vehicles and engines and alternative propulsion systems for agricultural and construction equipment and for marine and power generation applications. The Group has manufacturing, commercial and financial services companies located in 36 countries.

The Group's segments consist of: (i) Commercial and Specialty Vehicles, (ii) Powertrain, and (iii) Financial Services. The Group's Industrial Activities include the Group's entire enterprise without Financial Services (Commercial and Specialty Vehicles, Powertrain, and the Company, including the treasury operations). The Group generates revenues and cash flows principally from the sale of vehicles to dealers and distributors and engines to third parties. Financial Services provides a range of financial products focused on financing the sale and lease of vehicles to the Group's dealers and their customers.

RISK FACTORS

The following risks could cause the Company and the Group actual results to differ materially from past and projected future results as disclosed in the Prospectus prepared in connection with the Demerger and the first admission to listing and trading of all the common shares in the share capital of the Company. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the Group businesses. Risk appetite, impact of the risks, controls and any improvements to the risk management system will be disclosed in the Annual Report at 31 December 2022, which will cover the activity of Iveco Group N.V. as holding of the Group following the Demerger occurred on 1 January 2022.

The Group may have difficulties implementing its growth strategy and may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from being separated from the CNH Industrial Off-Highway business and cost management initiatives.

The Group's ability to increase its revenues and pursue growth and development objectives depends on the Group's success in carrying out its growth strategy, which includes simplifying its business and increasing its productivity, efficiency, and cash flow, all of which it expects will have a positive long-term effect on its business, results of operations, and financial condition. The Group's strategy originates from CNH Industrial's announced decision to separate its Iveco Group business and also includes the Group's simplification process related to its product portfolio. There can be no assurance that these initiatives or others will be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all.

Competitive activity, or failure by the Group to respond to actions by its competitors, could adversely affect its results of operations.

The Group operates in highly competitive global and regional markets. Depending on the particular country and product, the Group competes with other international, regional and local manufacturers and distributors of commercial and specialty vehicles and powertrains. The Group's global competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit, or even at a loss, to compete with the Group's product and service offerings. The Group competes primarily on the basis of product performance, innovation, quality, distribution, customer service, and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays, quality issues, or the Group's failure to price the Group's products competitively, could adversely affect the Group's business, results of operations, and financial position.

The COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity will depend on the scale, duration, severity and geographic reach of future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including notably the possibility of a recurrence or "multiple waves" of COVID-19 or the emergence of new variants. There have been instances of re-imposed local lockdowns where infection rates have started to increase again and there is a risk that widespread measures such as strict social distancing and curtailing or ceasing normal business activities may be reintroduced in the future until effective treatments or vaccines have been deployed. Uncertainties also include: disruptions in the supply chain in one or more key components that are impossible to be replaced in the short and medium term, and a prolonged delay in resumption of operations by one or more key suppliers, or the failure of key suppliers; the Group's ability to meet commitments to its customers on a timely basis as a result of increased costs and supply challenges; the ability to receive goods on a timely basis and at anticipated costs; increased logistics costs; delays in the Group's strategic initiatives as a result of the uncertain environment; possible legal claims related to personal protective equipment provided by the Group or alleged exposure to COVID-19 on the Group's premises; absence of employees due to illness; the impact of the pandemic on the Group's customers and dealers, and delays in their plans to purchase new vehicles; requests by the Group's customers or dealers for, or government mandated, payment deferrals and contract modifications; the impact of disruptions in the global capital markets and/or declines in the Group's financial performance, outlook or credit ratings, which could impact the Group's ability to obtain funding in the future; and the impact of the pandemic on demand for the Group's products and services as discussed above. In addition, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will also depend on any new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, how quickly normal economic conditions and operations can resume, the severity and duration of the current recession, and any additional actions to contain the spread or mitigate the impact of the virus, whether government-mandated or elected by the Group.

Global economic conditions impact the Group's businesses.

The Group's results of operations and financial position are and will continue to be influenced by macroeconomic factors - including changes in gross domestic product, the level of consumer and business confidence, changes in interest rates, the availability of credit, inflation and deflation, energy prices, and the cost of commodities or other raw materials - which exist in the countries and regions in which the Group operates. Such macroeconomic factors vary from time to time and their effect on the Group's results of operations and financial position may vary as well.

Further, escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine and massive military actions between Russia and Ukraine could adversely impact macroeconomic conditions, give rise to regional instability and result in heightened economic sanctions from the U.S., EU, and UK which may adversely affect us and our business in Russia, Ukraine and potentially elsewhere in Eastern Europe, including possible restrictions on our ability to do business with certain vendors or suppliers as well as the ability to repatriate funds from the region. We have conducted business in jurisdictions that may be subject to trade or economic sanction regimes and such sanctions could be expanded. If we fail to comply with sanction regimes or other similar laws or regulations we could be subject to damages and potentially other financial penalties, suspension of licenses, or a cessation of operations at our businesses, as well as damage to our brands' images and reputations.

McDonald’s has become the latest on the growing list of multinational companies to suspend activities in Russia, joining Apple , Levi’s and others, but some have chosen to stay in the country despite the risks to their reputation.

Following last month’s invasion of Ukraine, the pressure has been mounting and calls for repercussions appeared on social media under hashtags such as #BoycottMcDonalds and #BoycottPepsi.

“McDonald’s has decided to temporarily close all our restaurants in Russia and pause all operations in the market,” the fast-food giant announced on Tuesday US time.

While lamenting the impact on 62,000 people employed at 850 restaurants in Russia, the company said, “we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine.”

Coffee chain Starbucks announced it would halt operations in Russia on the same day.

NED-5565-Sanctions against Russia

“We have decided to suspend all business activity in Russia, including shipment of all Starbucks products,” noted the firm, which previously said it has 130 stores in Russia that are wholly owned and operated by a licensed partner.

Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson wrote that its licensed partner “has agreed to immediately pause store operations and will provide support to the nearly 2000 partners in Russia who depend on Starbucks for their livelihood.”

Also stopping business with Russia, Amazon ’s cloud-computing unit Amazon Web Services .

“Unlike other US technology providers, AWS has no data centres, infrastructure, or offices in Russia, and we have a long-standing policy of not doing business with the Russian government,” the company said.

“We have also stopped allowing new sign-ups for AWS in Russia and Belarus.”

And sift drink giants Coca-Cola and PepsiCo also followed suit on Tuesday US time.

“Our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,” Coca-Cola said in a statement announcing that it was “suspending its business in Russia.”

PepsiCo said: “Given the horrific events occurring in Ukraine we are announcing the suspension of the sale of Pepsi-Cola, and our global beverage brands in Russia, including 7Up and Mirinda.”

Major corporations across a range of industries have halted business in Russia since its troops invaded Ukraine on February 24, including everything from US-based tech firms such as Intel and Airbnb to French luxury giants LVMH , Hermes and Chanel.

These are the latest companies that have announced plans to exit Russia or to curb activities there:

Banking

US credit card and payments giant American Express suspended its operations in Russia and Belarus over Moscow’s “unjustified” attack on Ukraine.

“In light of Russia’s ongoing, unjustified attack on the people of Ukraine, American Express is suspending all operations in Russia,” the company said in a statement, noting that American Express cards will no longer work at merchants or ATM money machines in Russia.

“We are also terminating all business operations in Belarus,” it added.

In addition to blocking usage of globally issued Amex cards in Russia, “cards issued locally in Russia by Russian banks will no longer work outside of the country on the American Express global network,” the company said.

American Express noted its previous steps taken, including halting its relationships with banks in Russia that have been impacted by sanctions slapped on Russia by the United States and Western allies.

The move follows card payment titans Visa and Mastercard , which had announced on Saturday they will suspend operations in Russia.

“Noting the unprecedented nature of the current conflict and the uncertain economic environment,” Mastercard said it had “decided to suspend our network services in Russia.” Visa , for its part, said that “effective immediately” it would “work with its clients and partners within Russia to cease all Visa transactions over the coming days.”

RUSSIAN ATHLETES BANNED FROM OLYMPICS

Russian and Belarusian athletes have been banned from the Beijing Winter Paralympics over the war in Ukraine with organisers bowing to international pressure and threats of a boycott.

The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) International Paralympic Committee (IPC) International Paralympic Committee (IPC) International Paralympic Committee (IPC) just a day earlier said athletes from the two countries would be allowed to compete as “neutrals” in the Games, which start on Friday.

The decision by the IPC to expel the 83 Russian and Belarusian Paralympians represented an astonishing U-turn 24 hours after they had been told they could compete under a neutral banner.

The Germans had labelled their being allowed to compete as “a dark page” and had been especially infuriated to hear cheering ring out from Russia House in Beijing when the original decision was announced.

President of the IPC, Andrew Parsons , bowed to pressure despite having said that Wednesday’s sanction was the “harshest punishment” they could impose.

“To the para-athletes from the impacted countries, we are very sorry that you are affected by the decisions your governments took last week in breaching the Olympic Truce,” he said.

“You are victims of your governments’ actions.”

The Ukrainians, however, will be present at Friday’s opening ceremony in the Chinese capital, a “miracle” according to Ukraine’s Paralympic committee president, Valeriy Sushkevych.

“The easiest way for us would have been to not go to the Paralympics. But we couldn’t give up and not come,” he said.

WHO ’S LEFT IN PUTIN’S CORNER AS RUSSIA HIT WITH MORE BANS

As the world watched in horror and outrage over Russia’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine, world leaders were quick to condemn Vladimir Putin .

NATO , the EU and their allies are funnelling arms into Ukraine to fight off Russian invaders and arm an insurgency, if the war comes to that.

At the same time, NATO is moving military equipment and as many as 22,000 more troops into member states bordering Russia and Belarus, to reassure them and enhance deterrence.

But despite the swift chorus of condemnation from the West, some of the world‘s biggest powers have backed Mr Putin, claiming it is the West who provoked him and he has a right to stake a claim for Ukraine through the bloody war.

Other countries seem to be sitting on the fence, as they walk a tightrope between security concerns and economic interests.

The UN General Assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly adopted a resolution that “demands” Russia “immediately” withdraw from Ukraine, in a powerful rebuke of Moscow’s invasion by a vast majority of the world’s nations.

After more than two days of extraordinary debate, which saw the Ukrainian ambassador accuse Russia of genocide, 141 out of 193 United Nations member states voted for the non-binding resolution.

China, India and Pakistan was among the 35 countries which abstained, while just five — Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Belarus and of course Russia — voted against it.

PUTIN’S BACKERS

Belarus

Belarus and Russia share more than just a land border.

The former Soviet nations have important economic and political ties, with Russia accounting for 48 per cent of Belarus‘ external trade.

Syria

Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad supports Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Syria has been a staunch ally of Moscow since Russia launched a military campaign in Syria in 2015 that helped to turn the tide in a civil war in favour of President Bashar al-Assad with massive aerial bombardment of opposition-held areas.

Venezuela

Venezuela‘s President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday assured Mr Putin of his “strong support” in a telephone call, according to a Kremlin statement.

In the call initiated by Mr Caracas, the Venezuelan leader also condemned “destabilising actions of the United States and NATO ” and spoke out against a Western campaign of ”lies and disinformation,” it said.

Myanmar

Myanmar’s military junta expressed support for Russian President Vladimir Putin again on Sunday, blaming his invasion of Ukraine on that country’s leader and its people.

North Korea

North Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations said on Tuesday that the US and its allies are the root cause for the crisis in Ukraine, having ignored Russia’s “reasonable and just” demands for security.

The Kim Jong Un regime has long accused the U.S. of double dealing, viewing its own weapons development as a deterrent against outside attacks.

NED-5565-Sanctions against Russia

ALLIES SITTING ON THE FENCE

China

China has so far refused to call Russia‘s action in Ukraine an ’invasion’ or criticise the Kremlin despite intensifying assaults from Putin’s military.

Beijing has also thrown Moscow another sanction-busting lifeline by lifting wheat import restrictions in an economic boost to Moscow despite sweeping sanctions imposed by the West in a bid to stop the war.

India

India has not explicitly condemned Russia’s actions or called them an invasion, nor voiced support for Mr Putin.

The Russian embassy in India welcomed the stance, saying: “Highly appreciate India’s independent and balanced position at the voting in the UNSC .”

Pakistan

Pakistan became the first major nation to back Mr Putin as it signed the first new trade deal with Russia since the invasion.

Prime Minister and former cricketer Imran Khan said his country will import about 2 million tonnes of wheat and supplies of natural gas after meeting the Russian President last Thursday – the day he sent troops into its sovereign neighbour.

Pakistan has expressed concern about the invasion but stopped short of condemning it.

NED-5580-Ukraine invasion areas held by Russian troops

Brazil

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Sunday declined to condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin‘s invasion of Ukraine, while departing from his government’s official stance at the United Nations to say Brazil would remain neutral.

The country is cautiously assessing the risks and benefits of throwing their full support behind the Russian invasion.

Cuba

Cuba, with a decades-long relationship with Moscow, and Nicaragua, whose authoritarian leader has expressed support for the invasion, abstained from the UN vote condemning Russia’s actions.

Central Asia

The nations of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan have all tried to remain out of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

The countries maintain strategic partnerships with Russia but none of their governments have spoken out in support of the invasion.

South Africa

South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation last week called on Russia to withdraw its troops and respects Ukraine’s sovereignty and integrity.

But President Cyril Ramaphosa has now effectively rescinded the statement, wanting to take a more neutral stance.

An updated statement by ambassador Mathu Joyini failed to condemn or even name Russia, saying: ‘South Africa is of the view that this armed conflict, like all others, will result in unnecessary human suffering and destruction with global ramifications.

FULL LIST: HOW THE WORLD HAS BANNED AND BOYCOTTED RUSSIA

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pleaded for help from world leaders as Russian forces continue their advance on Ukraine.

In response, Australia, Canada, the European Union , Japan, New Zealand, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States have unveiled a series of sanctions against Russia targeting banks, oil refineries, and military exports.

The country has also been banned from major international sporting competitions and arts.

Here are some of the ways Russia is being hit hard by the international community in a bid to deter their aggressive invasion.

APPLE SUSPENDS PRODUCT SALES

Apple has halted sales of its products in Russia, joining Silicon Valley companies including Google and Facebook -owner Meta in blocking access to Russian state media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik.

“We are deeply concerned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and stand with all of the people who are suffering as a result of the violence,” the company said in a statement. Customers are now unable to make purchases from the Russian version of Apple ’s online store, which shows products including the latest iPhones as “currently unavailable”.

“We have taken a number of actions in response to the invasion,” Apple said. “We have paused all product sales in Russia. Last week, we stopped all exports into our sales channel in the country.”

RUSSIA’S SPORTING FREEZE OVER UKRAINE INVASION

Two of the largest sports governing bodies have announced decisions to prevent Russian teams from participating in international competitions.

On Monday, The International Olympic Committee (IOC) urged sports federations and organisers to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from international events.

Hours later world football’s governing body FIFA kicked Russia out of the 2022 World Cup as football’s global governing body and UEFA joined forces to expel Russian national teams and clubs from all international competitions.

FIFA and UEFA banned Russian national and club soccer teams from competing in any competitions indefinitely, putting the men’s national team in jeopardy of not qualifying for the 2022 World Cup set to begin in November.

NED-5565-Sanctions against Russia

On Tuesday, Russia lost the right to host the men’s Volleyball World Championships – which the old Soviet Union won twice – in August and September.

“The FIVB Board of Administration has come to the conclusion that it would be impossible to prepare and stage the World Championships in Russia due to the war in Ukraine,” said the International Volleyball Federation in a statement.

“It has accordingly decided to remove from Russia the organisation of the FIVB Volleyball Men’s World Championship scheduled to be held in August and September 2022.”

Russian ice-skaters have also been barred from all competitions in another significant blow to a country who under President Vladimir Putin had used sport as a powerful force for its image both globally and internally.

Russia is traditionally a powerhouse in the sport, winning six medals at the Beijing Olympics including two gold.

This rules them out of March’s world championships to be hosted in Montpellier, France.

RUSSIAN VODKA STRIPPED OFF SHELVES

One of Russia’s most famous imports, vodka, has been banned by retailers and hospitality venues in multiple countries as they stripped Russian products from shelves in a united protest against the invasion on Ukraine. Despite most bottles of vodka not coming from Russia, the boycott remains ongoing since the spirit has long been associated with the country.

In Australia, major liquor retailers Dan Murphy’s, BWS and Cellarmasters , as well as alcohol delivery service Jimmy Brings, and hundreds of pubs under the ALH banner will take part in the boycott. Coles Liquor stores Liquorland, Vintage Cellars and First Choice have also joined the cohort of retailers in pulling the products from their shelves in a sign of solidarity with Ukraine.

RUSSIAN MEERKAT ADS PULLED

The price comparison website Comparethemarket has pulled its ads featuring the animated Russian meerkat Aleksandr Orlov in light of the Ukraine invasion.

The British-based firm said it had reviewed its media strategy due to the sensitivities around the Russian invasion.

EUROVISION BARS RUSSIA OVER UKRAINE INVASION

No Russian entertainers will be permitted to take part in this year’s Eurovision Song Contest following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the European Broadcasting Union said Friday.

The glitzy annual musical pageant, which has millions of viewers in Europe and even Australia, will go ahead without any acts from Russia, the EBU ’s executive board decided.

“In light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine, the inclusion of a Russian entry in this year’s contest would bring the competition into disrepute,” the EBU said in a statement.

The call to exclude Russia from this year’s Eurovision in Italy was “based on the rules of the event and the values of the EBU ”, the body said.

In addition, Russia residents will also be blocked from voting in the competition.

“They are completely excluded from the whole event,” an EBU spokesman told AFP. “The EBU is an apolitical member organisation of broadcasters committed to upholding the values of public service,” its statement stressed.

The song contest “promotes international exchange and understanding, brings audiences together, celebrates diversity through music and unites Europe on one stage.”

Meanwhile, acclaimed Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, chief of Saint Petersburg’s Mariinsky Theatre and known for his warm Kremlin ties, was suddenly dropped from concerts where he was due to lead the Vienna Philharmonic at New York’s Carnegie Hall.

London’s Royal Opera House said on Friday it was cancelling a season of performances by Moscow’s famed Bolshoi Ballet.

CLOSING OF AIRSPACE

The European Union , United Kingdom and Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania decided to close their airspace to all Russian airlines. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines suspended its codesharing partnership with Russian national airline Aeroflo.

“We have removed our code from Aeroflot-operated services beyond Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport and removed Aeroflot ’s code from Delta-operated services from Los Angeles and New York-JFK,” Delta said in a statement.

CYBERATTACKS

CyberattacksAnonymous, the international hacker activist group behind various cyberattacks, announced they would be launching “unprecedented cyberattacks” against Putin, declaring war on his regime. The group said they already have hacked a Russian military database and published data online, as well as disabling websites of media outlets in Russia.

How SWIFT, the global payments messaging system, became a weapon in the financial war against Russia; SWIFT delivers some 40 million payment orders to 11,500 banks and other financial institutions every day, and works on mutual trust

Rome, Italy

The West’s sanctions campaign against Russia reached a new and unprecedented level over the weekend, when the United States, Canada, Britain and the European Union agreed to overcome their internal divisions and cut some Russian banks out of SWIFT [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-western-allies-russia-access-swift/] – the heart of the global payments network.

They made the announcement as Russian forces surrounded Kyiv [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-zelensky-releases-prisoners-to-join-fight-as-ukraine-russia-talks/] and heavy fighting was reported in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-biggest city.

The European Commission said the move, on top of ratcheted-up sanctions on Russia’s financial system, businesses, oligarchs and the denizens of the Kremlin itself, was designed to ensure the invasion of Ukraine [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-russia-launches-attacks-on-ukrainian-cities-as-putin-declares-military/] is a “strategic failure.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, “Cutting banks off will stop them from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and effectively block Russian exports and imports.”

Will it? While there is no doubt the SWIFT weapon will inflict a lot of pain, it is unlikely on its own to deliver a death blow to the banks.

What is SWIFT?

SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication . It has been around since the 1970s, operates as a co-operative and is based in Belgium. SWIFT is often inaccurately described as a payments system; it actually delivers payment messages as if it were a kind of glorified, secure and fast telex system. SWIFT is massive. It delivers some 40 million payment orders to 11,500 banks and other financial institutions every day, and works on mutual trust.

What is SWIFT’s reputation as a weapon of mass financial destruction?

Formidable, or at least that is its image. Cutting banks out of SWIFT has often been called the “nuclear” option, as if doing so were guaranteed to flatten them. In 2014, when Russia seemed on the verge of exclusion from SWIFT for having annexed Crimea, Alexei Kudrin , a former Russian finance minister, forecast that the sanction would shrink GDP by 5 per cent. The then-prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev , said it would be tantamount to “a declaration of war.” Iran in 2012 was cut out of SWIFT and the pain was fast and furious. After its banks were disconnected, the country lost almost half of its oil export revenue and 30 per cent of its foreign trade, according to Maria Shagina, a sanctions expert who is a visiting fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.

If eliminating SWIFT would be so effective, what was the resistance to using it against Russia?

Because SWIFT works both ways. The targeted banks would not be able to make payments, but also would not be able to receive payments. This scenario terrified the European countries that imported a lot of Russian gas, notably Germany and Italy. The Kremlin-controlled gas giant Gazprom uses SWIFT to receive payments from the utilities in those countries. Evidently, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi feared Gazprom would turn off the taps if its payments went missing. Missing gas was only one worry. Germany, Italy and Austria all have close trade relationships with Russia. Payment for everything from German BMWs to Italian fashion brands could be at risk. Paolo Gentiloni , the EU ’s trade commissioner, said Europe “would pay a price” for the various sanctions, including reduced sales in Russia and rising energy costs.

How did the countries in favour of whacking the Russian banks convince the doubters?

Not all Russian banks will get the SWIFT-less treatment (though Sberbank , the country’s biggest retail bank, would). It appears that certain energy-related banks would remain locked into SWIFT to allow payments for gas and oil deliveries to continue, perhaps with some restrictions. Mr. Draghi made it clear even before Russia launched the invasion on Thursday that he did not want Russian energy to be part of the West’s sanctions package.

Will Russia truly suffer without access to SWIFT?

Probably less so than it would have several years ago. Russian President Vladimir Putin has no doubt been preparing for this moment since 2014, when the SWIFT threat first emerged. Besides ensuring that Russia had ample foreign reserves and a low debt-to-GDP ratio, the country created a SWIFT clone called the System for Transfer of Financial Messages, which is similar to China’s version, the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System. The Russian one is small; in 2020, only about 400 financial institutions in 23 countries used it. If Russia and China worked together, they might be able to build a viable competitor to SWIFT, but that would take years. Mr. Putin and his Kremlin finance wizards may have other workarounds that we don’t even know about to offset the loss of SWIFT.

Could the sanctions on Russia’s central bank inflict even more damage than eliminating SWIFT?

Yes, for sure. The new sanctions on the central bank are aimed at freezing its foreign exchange reserves of US$630-billon, equivalent to 38 per cent of GDP, held in various Western currencies and assets, including gold. These holdings are scattered everywhere, some of them in countries that will enforce the sanctions. Hitting the central bank is an enormous blow to Russia. It would, for instance, severely limit its ability to use foreign cash to prop up the sagging ruble. That sanction, combined with cutting the banks out of SWIFT, might prove devastating to Russia’s banks and economy. The question is how Russia will retaliate.

Cats, Dostoevsky, is chemistry next?

The Fédération Internationale Féline, an organization founded in France in 1979, is prohibiting the import or registration of cats bred in Russia, while also preventing cats owned by exhibitors living in Russia from entering their show. The decision was taken on Tuesday.

A day later, the University of Milano-Bicocca in Italy informed Professor Paulo Nori that his course on 19th-century Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky had been canceled "to avoid controversy". The professor was so angry that he said in a video that "Being Russian today in Italy is a fault, even when dead." A later report said that the university has reversed its decision and Nori can continue teaching his course. However, the initial decision and numerous others show the ridiculous extents to which the West will go when it comes to "boycotting" and "sanctioning".

Whenever any conflict arises, "sanctions" and "boycotts" seem to be the first words some Western politicians can think of. They "boycotted" the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics over the Crimean crisis. Since Russia is not holding any major event at the moment, they decided to exclude it from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, suspend the release of movies in Russia, and even "sanction" Russian cats and a Russian novelist from the 19th century.

The Western politicians know very well that at the root of the Russia-Ukraine problem is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's constant expansion eastward, unmindful of Russia's security concerns. Sanctioning everything that is Russian only serves to push Russia further into a corner. It also shows that the Western leaders have no wish to bring peace in Ukraine. Rather, they want to add fuel to the flames.

Given their desperate zeal to ban all things Russian, maybe they should be reminded that the periodic table, which is the foundation of chemistry, was created by Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, in 1869. So, what next? Will Western universities next drop chemistry courses from their syllabi?

Where have all the Russian glitterati gone? Now great cancellation extends to Paris fashion week as FROWS empty of models Irina Shayk, Sasha Pivovarova and Natalia Vodianova - and couture houses come under pressure to show support for Ukraine

* Russian celebrities and influencers are notably absent from Paris Fashion Week

* Usual big hitters such as Irina Shayk and Sasha Pivovarova are absent this year

* Only former World No. 1 Maria Sharapova has braved the front row in France

* Questions arose over links between oligarchs and inner circles of high fashion

The inner circles of 'high fashion' are facing a reckoning amid their uncomfortable ties to Russian money as celebrities, influencers and models abandon the front row amid Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

This week, many Russian stars appear to have declined invitations to the hottest ticket in the sartorial calendar and abandoned the front rows of Paris Fashion Week.

The usual big hitters from Russia such as Irina Shayk, Sasha Pivovarova and Natalia Vodianova have all stayed away and used Instagram to condemn the war as Putin's troops continue to pour into Ukraine.

Only former World No. 1 Maria Sharapova, 34, has braved the trip to the French capital - leaving the usual merry-go-round of wealthy Russians who are often picturing lining runways in New York, London or Milan conspicuously empty.

Instead, British and American celebrities including Victoria Beckham, Bella Hadid and Rihanna have been pictured rubbing shoulders.

It means that luxury labels - who often use their catwalks as an in-person catalogue for many of their wealthiest clients - are likely to miss out on the orders from many of their affluent Russian customers.

Questions have also arisen over the close links forged between the inner circle of Russia's high fashionistas and wealthy oligarchs - who have either been named on international sanction lists or are alleged to have close links to Putin.

Roman Abramovich's ex-wife, Dasha Zhukova ran her own fashion label and remains editor-in-chief of avant garde fashion magazine POP.

And Ulyana Sergeenko, an influential Russian fashion designer, was married to Danil Khachaturov, a tycoon who was named among oligarchs to be sanctioned by the United States in 2018.

The developments come amid a backdrop of celebrities and influencers facing pressure to condemn Putin's invasion and the threat of financial sanctions looming over Russian oligarchs and tycoons.

Russian model Irina Shayk on Monday took to Instagram with an image of a peace sign, in expressing her support for the people of Ukraine.

She captioned the post: 'No To War.'

She continued: 'I will be donating to @unicef and @redcrossukraine - Please check my stories for donation links and resources, give what you can. Praying for peace.'

Sasha Pivovarova, a Russian model who is known for being the longest appearing fashion model for Prada, took to social media to share a picture showing Ukraine's flag with a yellow and blue heart.

Meanwhile, Sasha Luss, a Russian model and actress, took to her Instagram stories to urge her followers to donate food, water and hygeine products to Ukrainian refugees.

Sharing links to an array of organisations, she wrote: 'Give now to rush urgently needed water, food, hygiene kits and ongoing support for families, especially women, children and the elderly.'

Russian supermodel Vlada Roslyakova also shared a video urging peace, while Natalia Vodianova, who is also Russian, said she was going to donate to Ukraine.

The usual big-spending core of Russian shoppers - who use their deep pockets to lavish themselves with fashionable garments - are still yet to be seen at Paris Fashion Week.

This week, the global fashion industry faced an unprecedented wave of pressure to use their influential platforms and huge social media followings to do more to support Ukraine following the Russian invasion.

Notable Russian influencers, models and celebrities, including Irina Shayk who once dated Cristiano Ronaldo, have slowly started to speak out on the war.

The 36-year-old supermodel took to Instagram on Tuesday to share an image of a peace sign as she expressed her support for Ukraine. She wrote: 'No To War'.

Natalia Vodianova, 40, who states she is a UN Good Will Ambassador on her social media channels, wrote: 'As a mother my heart goes out to all mothers who are suffering the consequences of recent events in Ukraine and everyone effected (sic) by this conflict.

'Women will be the ones carrying most burden of this conflict and I want them to know that they are not alone.

'I can't help alone but together as a community, we can do a lot. I will be listing organisations that you can donate to to help and which I will be donating to.'

Other influencers such as Natasha Poly (1million followers) are yet to share any permanent statement online.

Ukrainian models, designers and editors that left their hometowns for Milan Fashion Week have spoke of their difficulty at being away from their friends, families and employees as their country descended into a war zone within hours of their departure.

Many who expected a week of glamour in the Italian fashion capital have spoken of bizarre parallel worlds as they walk the runway in front of A-listers in designer clothes, while their friends and family hide out in bomb shelters at home.

They described how the 'tone deaf' fashion community has failed to properly acknowledge the Russian invasion and spoke of their heartache at trying to helped loved ones still trapped.

Some are desperately trying to get back to their families in Ukraine while others are heading for Poland in the hope of being reunited with loved ones across the border.

Critical comments had flooded in online after many couture houses, and much of their wealthy Russian crowd, chose to bury their heads in the sand as their country wages war with their Ukrainian neighbours.

La Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, the governing body of Paris Fashion Week, had ignored calls to postpone the show, but did offer a statement of solidarity with the Ukrainian people.

Its president, Ralph Toledano, said: 'Given the present context, the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode encourages you to experience the shows of the coming days with solemnity, and in reflection of these dark hours.'

Olivier Rousteing, the French fashion designer of Balmain, took to Instagram during Paris Fashion Week to share a rare political message on the invasion.

He said: 'It's hard to feel right focusing on clothes as we listen with a heavy heart to the news. We are well aware that there are more important things happening in the world today.'

Balenciaga, whose creative director Demna Gvasalia hails from Georgia, became the first house to make a statement when it deleted all of its fashion content on Instagram days before its show in Paris - replacing it with calls to donate to the World Food Programme.

But some have called for far tougher response across the industry.

1Granary, a London-based magazine whose editor-in-chief, Olya Kuryshchuk, is Ukrainian, published an open letter demanding fashion businesses and their leaders 'stand with Ukraine and condemn Russia's invasion'.

TsUM Kyiv, a department store in the capital which has been closed since Putin's troops started flooding into Ukraine, has been leading calls for fashion houses to cut off their trade with Russia.

'The fashion industry needs to stand up. Stop trading – stop supplying Russia. Stop your relationships with Russia,' marketing director Marusya Koval said in an interview with Vogue Business.

Some have already heeded that call, including Danish brand Ganni and Hungarian label Nanushka who have already chosen to halt their sales in Russia.

Peter Baldaszti, the chief executive of Nanushka, was at a show during Milan fashion week when he first heard about the Russian invasion. He described cutting trade in Russia as a 'significant financial decision' for the brand.

'We have respect for the Russian people and our partners,' he said.

'We know this is not their decision, but it is impossible to do business with Russia based on our moral values.'

UK-based fashion entrepreneur Paul Harfleet said: 'The ability of such large fashion businesses to yield their "soft" power will undoubtedly have some impact on the Russian high street, fashion industry and economy, but will Putin take note? It’s unlikely.

'Longer terms effects specific to the fashion industry are impossible to predict, but I do hope that we can separate Putin from his people. It’s clear many Russians are as appalled by his actions as I am.

'It may well be that people start to shun Russian brands, as we're already seeing, but it's important to note that not all Russians back Putin.'

Paris Fashion Week comes as crippling Western sanctions were first enacted - forcing Russia's financial markets into turmoil and causing the rouble to sink to record lows against the dollar.

With the national currency plummeting in value, wealthy Russians are turning to luxury goods as a potential source of relief as scores of fashion brands - including Burberry, Ganni, and Yoox Net-a-Porter - temporarily halt trade in Russia.

Bullish investors looking to retain the value of their assets are now turning to watches, jewellery and precious metals, which often serve as a hedge against inflation.

Last week, senior EU sources said Italy rushed to remove the likes of Gucci loafers and designer handbags from any export bans agreed by the bloc.

One EU diplomat said Italy's argument was that banning sales to Russian oligarchs 'would have been largely symbolic'.

But senior Italian government sources reacted furiously, with one saying the country's prime minister Mario Draghi 'did not seek a carve-out on Italian luxury goods – that is categorically untrue'.

Russian consumers still only account for approximately 3 per cent of global luxury sales.

It comes as high-end brands, such as Italian jeweller Bulgari, are still reporting strong sales in Russia despite the invasion of Ukraine and the looming threat of sanctions, Bloomberg reports.

'In the short term [restrictions have] probably boosted the business,' the jeweller's chief executive Jean-Christophe Babin told Bloomberg.

'How long it will last it is difficult to say, because indeed with the SWIFT measures, fully implemented, it might make it difficult if not impossible to export to Russia,' he added.

It comes as Nick Thomas-Symonds MP, Labour's spokesman on international trade, demanded further action from the Government on financial penalties for those with links to Putin and his war effort.

Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Thomas-Symonds called for a 'total ban on the export of luxury goods' into the country in a bid to stop 'Putin and his inner circle living a Mayfair lifestyle in Moscow'.

'Whether it is on clothing, on jewellery, on diamonds... [the UK should] get a comprehensive ban in place to stop Putin and his inner circle living in luxury while barbaric, evil acts are perpetrated against the people of Ukraine', he added.

The day Magaly Medina confronted a Latina producer for the way she presented the news.

Magaly Medina is one of the most famous hosts on television. Her irreverent style and her ability to openly express her opinions have made her one of the best known figures in the world of show business. However, years ago she also ventured into informative spaces.

In 2017 she joined the panel of journalists of "90 matinal" in Latina, but her passage through said news program was short and eventful, due to various episodes that evidenced her differences with members of the production team.

Why did she get uncomfortable with the producer?This could be seen in an argument that Magaly Medina had with a producer of the news program, a moment that was recorded on video even though she was unaware that she was being recorded.

The television personality demanded the worker to close the shots used in the program. In the images that were broadcast, she is heard criticizing the work of the directors, as she felt she looked too small in front of the cameras.

"Sometimes I don't feel comfortable standing still. It feels like they focus on everything and you're a dwarf giving your opinion. If I'm going to read news and I'm going to be a talking bust, you let me know to quit on the spot," she said with obvious annoyance.

Magaly Medina and her exit from Latina.In 2018, Magaly Medina hosted the opinion program "La purita verdad", space that finally led her to leave Latina for her controversial messages to the audience.

After having several problems with Latina executives, the straw that broke the camel's back was her opinion on the sanction Paolo Guerrero received from the TAS after testing positive in an anti-doping test, which disqualified him from playing in the World Cup in Russia (before his appeal).

"It's very hard to believe that in a teapot you had a little bit of coca tea and they added a little bit of aniseed, and that gave you a metabolite that is found in cocaine. This position maintained by Guerrero and his defense was not believed," she said.

Shortly after, the hostess was temporarily removed from Latina. According to channel executives, her departure was due to differences in the treatment of the information presented in the program. However, it was emphasized that the decision was made by both parties.

"At times like this, when Peruvians must be united as a single team, Latina and Mrs. Magaly Medina have decided by mutual agreement that she will be temporarily removed from the air, as they do not agree with the vision and treatment of very relevant issues for our channel and the country", reads the statement.

PART I

Item 1. Business.

Introduction

We are a Delaware corporation formerly known as GigCapital, Inc., and as a result of our business combination with Kaleyra S.p.A. on November 25, 2019, we changed our name to Kaleyra, Inc. (which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our "Business Combination").

Business Overview

Our Vision

Kaleyra provides mobile communication services to financial institutions, e-commerce players, over-the-top media providers ("OTTs"), software companies, logistic enablers, healthcare providers, retailers, and other large organizations worldwide. Through its proprietary cloud communications platforms (collectively as the "Platforms"), Kaleyra manages multi-channel integrated communication services on a global scale, consisting of messaging, rich messaging and instant messaging (including WhatsApp®), video, push notifications, e-mail, programmable voice services, Interactive Voice Response ("IVR") configurations, and chatbots. The increasing demand for cloud communications is driven by the growing, and often mandated, need for enterprises to undertake a digital transformation that includes omnichannel, mobile-first and interactive customer communications. Mobile network operators typically are the gateway to reach end-user consumers' mobile devices. Kaleyra enables its customers and business partners to connect enterprise software and applications to mobile network operators by providing carefully documented Application Programming Interfaces ("APIs"). In addition, Kaleyra also offers an extensive set of no-coding cloud-based visual interfaces to programme communications to the customers across multiple channels. Kaleyra's Platforms couples the possibility of sending communications to end-user customers to a "Software as a Service" or SaaS business model, creating what is generally referred to as a "Communications Platform as a Service", or simply CPaaS.

Kaleyra's vision is to be the CPaaS provider which best aligns with its customers' and business partners' communication requirements, or the most trusted provider in the world. This requires a combination of security, compliance and integration capabilities that protects the integrity and privacy of Kaleyra's customers' transactions and includes other key features such as ease of provisioning, reliable network connectivity, high availability for scaling, redundancy, embedded regulatory compliance, configurable monitoring and reporting. Kaleyra believes the percentage of CPaaS customers that will require security, compliance and integration will represent an increasingly larger portion of the market, particularly with the expected exponential growth of transactional-by-nature cloud communications applications, better enabling Kaleyra to set itself apart from its competition.

Kaleyra Today

Kaleyra is a result of the expansion of the former Ubiquity, which was founded in Milan, Italy in 1999. Ubiquity secured a leading market position in mobile messaging on behalf of the Italian financial services industry and then sought to expand its products and geographic offerings. Ubiquity acquired Solutions Infini of Bangalore, India in 2017 and Buc Mobile of Vienna, Virginia in 2018. It was rebranded as Kaleyra S.p.A. in February 2018. Following the integration of the acquired entities, the combined company is collectively engaged in the operation of the Platforms on behalf of Kaleyra's customers.

On February 22, 2019, the Company (f/k/a GigCapital, Inc.) entered into a stock purchase agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement") by and among the Company, Kaleyra S.p.A., Shareholder Representative Services LLC, as representative for the holders of the ordinary shares of Kaleyra S.p.A. immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination, and all of the stockholders of all of the Kaleyra S.p.A. stock (collectively, such Kaleyra S.p.A. stockholders, the "Sellers"), for the purpose of the Company acquiring all of the shares of Kaleyra S.p.A.. GigCapital Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on October 9, 2017 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.

As a result of the Business Combination, which closed on November 25, 2019, the Company (headquartered in Milan, Italy) became a multi-channel integrated communication services provider on a global scale.Kaleyraoperatedat the time of the closing of the Business Combinationin the CommunicationsPlatform as a Service ("CPaaS") market with operationsprimarilyin Italy, India,Dubaiand the United States. In connection with the closing, the Company changed its name fromGigCapital, Inc. toKaleyra, Inc.

On July 29, 2020, Kaleyra registered a German branch of Kaleyra S.p.A. with the German Chamber Tax Authority of Commerce. Kaleyra established its branch in Germany, by far the most important country in Europe to Kaleyra after Italy, to expand Kaleyra's footprint in Central Europe and the Nordic countries and allow it to leverage Kaleyra's trusted business solutions for customers in additional jurisdictions.

Kaleyra's subsidiary, Campaign Registry Inc., a systems initiative to reduce spam by collecting robotically driven campaign information and processing and sharing that information with mobile operators and the messaging ecosystem, began its soft launch during the second quarter of the fiscal year 2020, ending up with its first revenue contracts in the second half of that year.

On February 18, 2021, Kaleyra entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Vivial, Inc. ("Vivial") for the acquisition of the business known as mGage ("mGage"), a leading global mobile messaging provider in the United States (the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the "Merger").

On June 1, 2021, Kaleyra completed its acquisition of mGage for a total purchase price of $218.0 million. The Merger consideration consisted of both cash consideration and common stock consideration. On August 30, 2021, the Company prepared and delivered to the Stockholder Representative a written statement (the "Post-Closing Statement") setting forth the calculation of closing cash and closing net working capital which ultimately resulted in the final Merger consideration to be equal to $217.0 million pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The cash consideration amounted to $199.2 million of which $198.6 million was paid on June 1, 2021 and the remaining amount was settled during the period ended September 30, 2021, including a working capital adjustment of $997,000. The common stock consideration was paid with the issuance to Vivial's former equity holders of a total of 1,600,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock at the $11.77 per share closing price of Kaleyra common stock on the date of issuance, equal to $18.8 million. In support of the consummation of the Merger, on February 18, 2021, Kaleyra entered into subscription agreements (the "PIPE Subscription Agreements"), with certain institutional investors (the "PIPE Investors"), pursuant to which, among other things, Kaleyra agreed to issue and sell, in private placements to close immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, an aggregate of 8,400,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock to the PIPE Investors at $12.50 per share. Kaleyra also entered into convertible note subscription agreements (the "Convertible Note Subscription Agreements") with certain institutional investors (the "Convertible Note Investors"), pursuant to which Kaleyra agreed to issue and sell, in private placements to close immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, $200 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible notes (the "Merger Convertible Notes").

On July 1, 2021, Kaleyra completed a company reorganization of the acquired business of mGage through the initial dissolution of the Delaware single member LLCs of Vivial Holdings, LLC, Vivial Networks, LLC, and the following merger of mGage, LLC into the surviving holding company, Vivial Inc., which subsequentlychanged its name into Kaleyra US Inc., as a result of the reorganization. As a result ofthe merger, Kaleyra US Inc. became the holding company of the following entities: one hundred percent (100%) direct ownership of mGage Europe Ltd. (UK) and one hundred percent (100%) direct ownership of mGage SA de SV (Mexico).

On July 8, 2021, Kaleyra completed the acquisition of Bandyer Srl ("Bandyer") for cash consideration of $15.4 million.Bandyer offers cloud-based audio/video communications services via Web Real Time Communication ("WebRTC") technology to financial institutions, retail companies, utilities, industries, insurance companies, human resources, and digital healthcare organizations. Bandyer provides customers with programmable audio/video APIs and Software Development Kits ("SDKs") based on WebRTC technology for a variety of use cases, including Augmented Reality ("AR") applications for smart glasses.

Effective August 31, 2021, the common stock of the Company ceased trading on the NYSE American stock exchange and commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the ticker symbol "KLR." Kaleyra's warrants continue to trade on the NYSE American under the symbol "KLR WS".

On October 11, 2021, Kaleyra Africa Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kaleyra Inc., was incorporated under the law of South Africa with the registered office in Waterfall City, Gauteng. This newly established subsidiary is

part ofKaleyra'sbroader strategic plan of expanding into emerging markets whereby South Africa will serve asKaleyra'shub to enter the entire African market.

On November 15, 2021, pursuant to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, Kaleyra Dominicana, S.R.L., ninety-nine percent (99%) direct ownership of Kaleyra US Inc. and one percent (1%) direct ownership of Kaleyra Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the Dominican Republic with the registered office in Santo Domingo. This newly established subsidiary is aimed to provide the Kaleyra group with back-office technology support and engage in product development and innovation.

Kaleyra has more than 3,800 customers and business partners worldwide across industry verticals such as financial institutions, e-commerce players, OTTs, software companies, logistic enablers, healthcare providers, retailers, and other large organizations worldwide, with no single customer representing more than 10% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. Kaleyra's customers are located in regions throughout the world including Europe, Asia Pacific, North and South America. Kaleyra's revenue by country for the year ended December 31, 2021 is as follows: Italy (28.9%), India (26.6%), U.S. (21.4%) and South America (7.7%). The remainder of the revenue is primarily generated in Europe and Asia in countries other than Italy and India (15.4%).

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, 71% of revenues came from customers of Kaleyra which have been on the Platforms for at least one year. Although Kaleyra continues to expand by introducing new customers to the Platforms, the breadth and stability of its existing customers provide it with a solid base of revenue upon which it can continue to innovate and make investments to strengthen its product portfolio, expand its global presence, and in particular into the Americas markets following the recent acquisition of mGage, recruit world-class talent and target accretive acquisitions as well as to capitalize on its growing market penetration opportunities and value creation.

For example, banks and financial institutions deploy Kaleyra's services that include omnichannel mobile-first password reset, account access, two-factor authentications ("2FA"), transaction notifications, anti-fraud alerts, among other services, via a cloud implementation that meets their strict requirements for security and compliance. Kaleyra's Platforms have facilitated compliant communications for its existing financial institution customer base in Europe. European Central Bank ("ECB") regulations have begun to mandate additional customer protection regulations, such as those requiring strong customer authentications for all payment transactions over 30 euros, facilitating the digital transformation of both traditional banks and new entrants. In the financial sector, security and compliance are generally top of mind and the sales process relies on a dedicated local sales team focused on strong integration capabilities with the full suite of services needed to satisfy customer requirements.

Other enterprise customers of Kaleyra use Kaleyra's cloud communications services as packaged offerings that are easy to configure and manage around key end-user customer touchpoints. Although these enterprise customers require a lesser level of system integration than financial institution customers do, they still demand a sufficiently flexible system such as that which a cloud solution can provide to facilitate rapid communications system modification to accommodate changes in end-user customer behaviors. Furthermore, there are other enterprise customers for which connectivity to their end-user customers is their primary requirement, and these

customers are using the Platformsto gain access to mobile network operators worldwide. This additional volume, which is expected to continue to grow as the transformation from e-mail-based communications to messaging-based communications is being enhanced, allowsKaleyrato leverage relationships to sell and resell network connectivity on a more cost-effective basis.

In 2021 and 2020, there was no customer that individually accounted for more than 10% of Kaleyra's consolidated total revenues.

Seasonality

Historically, Kaleyra has experienced clear seasonality in its revenue generation, with slower traction in the first calendar quarter, and increasing revenues as the year progresses toward fourth calendar quarter, during which the Company usually registers the highest revenues in messaging and notification services. This patterned revenue generation behavior occurs due to Kaleyra's customers sending more messages to their end-user customers who are engaged in consumer transactions at the end of the calendar year, resulting in the increase in notifications of electronic payments, credit card transactions and e-commerce.

The Market for Kaleyra's Products

The CPaaS market is evolving and is expanding in several directions as enterprise adoption of cloud-based communications occurs. The need for enterprises to provide enhanced omnichannel end-user customer experiences is driving adoption by enterprises of embedded, real-time interactive communications for enhanced end-user customer-interfacing interactions. CPaaS market is expected to reach $25.9 billion in 2025 from $7.2 billion in 20201. The size of the global Application to Person ("A2P") messaging market will grow from $61B in 2019 to $78B in 20222. The volume of chatbot usage is expected to grow by 84% globally (2018 - 2023). In the U.S., access to chatbots will grow year over year by 160%, in India by 342%, in Western Europe 170%3. Kaleyra's products and services available through the Platforms address all the above-mentioned markets.

Kaleyra's Key Products

The Platforms

Kaleyra operates its core technology, the Platforms, in the public cloud and as private clouds, and in hybrid situations. The Platforms have a high-volume infrastructure that has been designed to easily scale and support large volumes of data. The Platforms consist of two separate types of interfaces; one for connectivity to mobile network operators and the other, a set of APIs that provide convenient and user-friendly tools that enable Kaleyra's customers to engage in communications with their end-user customers. The Platforms' underlying software code base contains communication protocols that allow connectivity with mobile network operators around the globe.

In addition, the Platforms' APIs, which sit on top of the underlying connectivity stack, enable the creation of specific applications (including messaging or voice-over-IP calls) or workflows (e.g. 2FA or password resets). These applications can be designed by Kaleyra, Kaleyra's customers' information technologies personnel, business users, and/or third-party developers. The open Platforms' architecture enables Kaleyra's customers and business partners to accomplish all of their communication needs from one simple interface that connects into a broad range of their systems. The relationship with Kaleyra's customers is strengthened by providing its customers with a broad and flexible platform. Retention of Kaleyra's customers is also enhanced as a result of the switching costs that Kaleyra's customers would incur to transition to alternate platforms.

Communications Services

The following graphic summarizes the capabilities of Kaleyra's suite of communications services:

This suite of services is further described below. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Kaleyra processed nearly 44 billion billable SMS messages and 6 billion voice calls on behalf of Kaleyra's customers.

Channels Messaging, RBM/RCS, Instant Messaging

The Platforms' APIs include software and infrastructure that process and manage SMS, Multimedia Messaging Service ("MMS") and Rich Communications Service ("RCS") through Google's technology called Rich Business Messaging ("RBM"), with network connectivity to mobile network operators around the world. The Platforms are currently designed to process five thousand messages per second, with the capability to increase the throughput with additional server power and speed. The Platforms support 87 languages and are capable of stitching together concatenated messages of up to 4,000 characters. The Platforms are also designed to manage automated opt-in and opt-out procedures per mobile network operator requirements and best practices.

Kaleyra's offering includes instant messaging such as WhatsApp® for Business by Meta, offering its customers the possibility to interact with their end-users for customer care and transactional communications. Communications can be handled by human agents, using Kaleyra's conversational interface, or by automated AI-powered chatbots using NLP/NLU and integrating with the third-party systems in use by the customers.

Channels - Voice

The Platforms' APIs include software and infrastructure that process and manage voice calls, including IVR and conferencing bridge capabilities. The Platforms offer features such as call masking, visual configurations of call routing, and click to call. Kaleyra also partners with Google for the distribution of their product named Verified Calls ("vCalls"), allowing brands to get their calling numbers verified for increased answer rates and reliability.

Channels - WebRTC

Kaleyra offers audio and video calling service to customers in multiple sectors, for use cases such as customer service, remote wealth management, telemedicine, remote field assistance, virtual meetings.

Channels -Email and push notifications

The offering of channels by Kaleyra is completed by e-mail and push notification, which provide inexpensive and commonly used means of communications with customers, oftenwise chosen by brands as an alternative to or fallback from other channels.

Tools

Kaleyra distinguishes itself in the market by providing a complete set of visual tools for non-coders, that make it possible for business users to programme communications across multiple channels without any developers' help. Users can setup campaigns, configure virtual phone numbers, perform lookups on mobile numbers, and create communications templates, by using Kaleyra's tools.

Solutions

Kaleyra works as a Co-Creator (Gartner, 2021) alongside the customers' marketing, business and Customer Experience ("CX") experts, and their developers, to co-design and invent solutions dedicated to specific industries and business problems. Along with this, Kaleyra also offers for all its products an extensive set of integrations to the most widely used CRM and marketing automation systems. Those integrations, sometimes available on request and oftenwise published on third-party marketplaces, enable a wider series of use cases for brands.

Operations

Kaleyra generates revenue primarily from usage-based fees earned from the sale of communications services utilizing the Platforms. These services are offered through access to the Platforms to large enterprises, as well as small and medium-sized customers. Revenue can be billed in advance or in arrears depending on the term of the agreement; for the majority of customers, revenue is invoiced on a monthly basis in arrears.

Kaleyra's CPaaS contracts do not provide customers and business partners with the right to take possession of the software supporting the applications.

As a part of the arrangement with its customers, Kaleyra also offers customer advanced support services, to guarantee the continuity and promptly delivery of the services. Revenue for these services is recognized ratably over the term of the service period.

Kaleyra utilizes a cloud infrastructure and its Platforms to deliver its communication services. The services are also provided using a private cloud as required by the customers and business partners. The cost of the Platforms and communication services purchased from mobile network operators is considered to be a cost of revenue.

Products in Development

Kaleyra has several new communications channels in its organic development pipeline, including new tools and solutions. Kaleyra has a growing team of software developers in the USA, in Bangalore, India and Milan, Italy engaged in research and development of additional product features based on customer feedback and market research. Kaleyra continues to evaluate possible acquisitions that can enhance its product portfolio.

Research and Development

As of December 31, 2021, 299 employees serve in Kaleyra's research and development and engineering departments representing about 53% of its workforce, focused on maintaining and enhancing the Platforms and the communications service offerings, as well as developing new communications services and engaging with Kaleyra's customers in this development.

Sales and Marketing

Kaleyra has multiple methods for engaging with its customers, depending upon the specific service offerings that a customer uses on the Platforms. 17% of Kaleyra's employee base are dedicated to sales of communications services to Kaleyra's customers or business partners. The go-to-market strategy utilizes a mixture of direct sales,

self-servicepurchasesand channel development, such as engaging third-party developers and system integrators that developcommunications solutions for multiple customers.Kaleyraalso actively participates in trade shows,industryand academic meetings on a global basisforlead generation and building of brand awareness.

Competitive Strengths

Over Kaleyra's 20-year history, Kaleyra has developed a powerful CPaaS solution that it believes represents a unique, high growth opportunity in the CPaaS market. The Platforms are accessible everywhere in the world, have a high-volume infrastructure that has been designed to be easily scalable, and allow for communications services that have been designed having security, compliance and integration capabilities that can meet the needs of Kaleyra's customers and their customers and regulators. Furthermore, Kaleyra continues to develop organically and strategically new communications services to meet the evolving needs of its customers and business partners. In addition, Kaleyra has identified the following competitive strengths:

Experienced Management Team

Kaleyra has a proven management team with many decades of combined international experience at industry-relevant companies.

Existing Customers and Relationships

Kaleyra believes its deep customer relationships provide it with the opportunity to expand deployment of the Platforms and the opportunity to quickly deploy new communications service offerings.

Growth Strategy

Kaleyra's organic growth focuses on four core areas:

• Exploiting cross-sale opportunities among Kaleyra's acquisitions in this area, Kaleyra focuses on growing existing product teams, accelerating joint product management and growing key technology integrations with industry-leading independent software vendors;

• Product evolution - in this area, Kaleyra works to enhance and expand features such as RCS and video applications; and

• Geographic expansion - in this area, Kaleyra focuses on entering new markets such as Southeast Asia and Latin America.

• Being part of larger technology ecosystems such as the marketplaces provided by the most well-known CRM and marketing automation platforms; and partnering with primary system integrators to be able to deliver full-fledged services to customers.

Furthermore, as shown with the acquisitions of mGage and Bandyer, mergers and acquisitions remain a key component of Kaleyra's growth strategy. As it has in the past with its acquisitions of Solutions Infini and Buc Mobile, Kaleyra has continuously explored the global market with the intent of evaluating and acquiring additional companies that are adding significant value from technology and product perspectives, as well as accretive in terms of revenue, net income and capitalization. Kaleyra intends to execute acquisitions in the least dilutive and most cost-effective manner, using cash from its balance sheet or other sources, equity or a combination of both.

Competition

The CPaaS market is highly competitive and characterized by continuous technological change. The principal competitive factors in this market include completeness of offering, credibility with developers and business users, global reach, ease of integration, product features, platform scalability, brand reputation and awareness, customer support, and the cost of deployment of product offerings. Kaleyra believes that it competes favorably within each of these categories.

Kaleyracompetes with several vendors across its various product lines, including:

• Legacy on-premises vendors, such as Avaya Holdings Corp., Cisco Systems, Inc., (through its acquisition of IMIMobile) and SAP SE;

• Direct competitors, such as CLX Communications AB (d/b/a Sinch), Infobip ltd, Twilio Inc., and Vonage Holdings Corp. (as of November 22, 2021, Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) entered into an agreement to acquire Vonage (NASDAQ: VG));

• Smaller software companies that compete with certain portions of Kaleyra's communications services offerings; and

• SaaS companies that offer prepackaged applications for a narrow set of use cases.

Some competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name and brand recognition, larger sales and marketing efforts and larger portfolios of intellectual property. As a result, certain competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing technologies, opportunities, standards or customer needs and requests. With the introduction of new products and services and new market entrants, Kaleyra expects competition to intensify in the future. Furthermore, as Kaleyra continues to expand the scope of its Platforms, it may face additional competition. Kaleyra is also addressing enterprises that have developed over the years "in-house" products for which Kaleyra can offer a more cost-effective, robust and richer set of products to enhance the total cost of ownership and return on investment for such customers.

Employees

As of December 31, 2021, Kaleyra has 564 employees, of which 299 were in research and development, 97 were in sales, marketing and business development and 168 were in general and administrative. None of Kaleyra's employees is currently covered under any collective bargaining agreements. Relations with Kaleyra's employees are considered good and a material work stoppage has never been experienced.

Facilities

Kaleyra leases 18 properties, with its headquarters in Milan, Italy. Kaleyra maintains a global footprint with additional leased facilities located in Bengaluru, India; Chennai, India; Delhi, India; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Kochi, India; Kolkata, India; London, United Kingdom; Los Angeles, California; Mexico City, Mexico; Mumbai, India; Munich, Germany; New York, New York and Vienna, Virginia. Kaleyra believes that its current facilities are adequate to meet its ongoing needs and that, if it requires adjusted or additional space, it will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms, or further consolidate facilities. Going forward, Kaleyra will continue to assess its facilities requirements and make appropriate adjustments as needed and dictated by the business.

Kaleyra operates 32 data centers, including cloud platforms operated by Amazon Web Services, and Kaleyra maintains private clouds on behalf of its customers. The Kaleyra private cloud devices are custom-built hardware running the Kaleyra's Platforms and, thus, can be deployed virtually anywhere. Kaleyra currently runs these private cloud devices out of its headquarters in Milan, Italy.

Intellectual Property

Kaleyra relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the U. S. and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to protect Kaleyra's proprietary technology. In addition, Kaleyra protects intellectual property rights by implementing a policy that requires its employees and independent contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on its behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on its

behalf areKaleyra'sproperty, and assigning toKaleyraany rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law.

• Kaleyra, as of December 31, 2021, has been issued 2 patents in the U.S.

• Kaleyra's trademark and certain variations thereof are registered or are the subject of pending trademark applications in the U.S. In addition to the Kaleyra trademark, Kaleyra has 18 additional trademark registrations or pending registrations in three different classes with the following authorities/countries: EU, India, South Africa, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, and the International Bureau (WIPO) China, Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines, Singapore.

• Kaleyra owns an Internet domain registration forkaleyra.comand certain other domains.

• Kaleyra generally controls access and the use of its proprietary software and other confidential information through internal and external controls including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners. Unauthorized parties may, nonetheless, still copy or otherwise obtain and use Kaleyra's software and technology despite Kaleyra's efforts to protect its trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements.

Regulatory

Kaleyra is subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to its business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, export taxation, general telecommunications laws or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which Kaleyra is subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm its business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which Kaleyra operates. Because global laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that it or its communications services or the Platforms may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.

In addition, as Kaleyra expands internationally, it will be subject to laws and regulations in the countries in which it offers services. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the EU member states, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") obtained from individuals located in the EU or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction, which are often more restrictive than those in the U.S. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of PII that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, telephone numbers, message addresses and, in some jurisdictions, IP addresses and other online identifiers.

For example, in April 2016 the EU adopted General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which took full effect on May 25, 2018. GDPR enhances data protection obligations for businesses and requires service providers (data processors) processing personal data on behalf of customers to cooperate with European data protection authorities, implement security measures and keep records of personal data processing activities. Noncompliance with the GDPR can trigger fines equal to or greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual revenues. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, preparing to meet the requirements of GDPR has required significant time and resources, including a review of Kaleyra's technology and systems currently in use against the requirements of GDPR. Kaleyra has furthermore appointed an external global Data Protection Officer to further assure and maintain its compliance with the GDPR, where applicable. There are also additional EU laws and regulations (and member states' implementations thereof) which govern the protection of consumers and of electronic communications.

Furthermore, outside of the EU, Kaleyra continues to see increased regulation of data privacy and security, including the adoption of more stringent subject matter specific state laws in the U.S. For example, on June 28, 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt-out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation.

Kaleyrais subject to individual or joint jurisdiction of theFederal Communications Commission ("FCC"), the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys generalas well as the Italian Data Protection Authority ("DPA") (as the relevant EU National DPA)with respect to privacy and data security obligations. IfKaleyrawas to suffer or if one ofKaleyra'scustomers were to suffer a breach,Kaleyramay be subject to the jurisdiction of a variety of federal agencies' jurisdictions,state attorneys generalas well as of the Italian DPA.Kaleyramay have to comply with a variety of data breach laws at the federal,stateand EUlevels, comply with any resulting investigations, as well as offer mitigation to customers and potential end-users of certain customers to whichKaleyraprovides services.Kaleyracould also be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties that may adversely impactKaleyra'sbusiness.

As Kaleyra continues to expand internationally, Kaleyra has become subject to telecommunications laws and regulations in the foreign countries where Kaleyra offers its products. Kaleyra's international operations are subject to country-specific governmental regulation or country-specific rules imposed by local carriers with whom Kaleyra has a direct contractual relationship, or indirect relationship through a local partner company, and related actions that have increased and may continue to increase Kaleyra's costs or impact its products and platform or prevent Kaleyra from offering or providing Kaleyra's products in certain countries.

For example, in Italy, Kaleyra holds a license to be a fixed-line operator and is subject to the Electronic Communications Code, or the ECC, which has been enacted with Legislative Decree no. 259/2003, as amended, which transposed a package of European Directives adopted in 2002 and amended in 2009; the National Numbering Plan, issued with AGCom's resolution no. 8/15/CIR as amended, which governs the usage of national numbers for the provision of electronic communications services as a whole; resolutions on the use of alphanumeric indications for the identification of the calling subject in SMS (so-called Alias), that are periodically issued by AGCom, starting from AGCom's resolution no. 42/13/CIR; and the GDPR (EU Regulation 2016/679) as well as the Italian Privacy Code (Legislative Decree no. 196/2003 as amended, following the applicability of the GDPR, by the Legislative Decree no. 101/2018).

In addition, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA") restricts telemarketing and the use of automatic text messages without proper consent. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving and developing. If Kaleyra does not comply with these laws, or regulations or if Kaleyra becomes liable under these laws or regulations due to the failure of its customers to comply with these laws by obtaining proper consent, Kaleyra could face direct liability.

The Federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 ("CAN-SPAM Act") establishes certain requirements for commercial messages and transactional messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. Among other things, the CAN-SPAM Act, obligates the sender of commercial messages to provide recipients with the ability to "opt-out" of receiving future commercial communications from the sender. In addition, some states have passed laws regulating commercial communication practices that are significantly more restrictive and difficult to comply with than the CAN-SPAM Act. For example, Utah and Michigan prohibit the sending of communication messages that advertise products or services that minors are prohibited by law from purchasing (e.g., alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, illegal drugs) or that contain content harmful to minors (e.g., pornography) to message addresses listed on specified child protection registries. Some portions of these state laws may not be preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act. In addition, certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as Australia, Canada, and the EU, have enacted laws that regulate sending messages, and some of these laws are more restrictive than U.S. laws. For example, some foreign laws prohibit sending broad categories of messages unless the recipient has provided the sender advance consent to receipt of such messages, or in other words has "opted-in" to receiving such communication. If Kaleyra were found to be in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act, applicable state laws governing messages not preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act or foreign laws regulating the distribution of messages, whether as a result of violations by Kaleyra's customers or its own acts or omissions, Kaleyra could be required to pay large penalties, which would adversely affect its financial condition, significantly harm Kaleyra's business, injure Kaleyra's reputation and erode customer trust. The terms of any injunctions, judgments, consent decrees or settlement agreements entered into in connection with enforcement actions or investigations against Kaleyra in connection with any of the foregoing laws may also require Kaleyra to change one or more aspects of the way Kaleyra operates its business, which could impair Kaleyra's ability to attract and retain customers or could increase its operating costs.

In addition, in order to provide services to consumer telephone numbers from the EU or certain other regions, Kaleyra may be required to register with the local telecommunications regulatory authorities, some of which have

been increasingly monitoring and regulating the categories ofsender identity andnumbers that are eligible for provisioningservices to end-user on behalf ofKaleyra'scustomers.Kaleyrahas registered and is in the process of registering in various countries in whichKaleyradoes business, but in some countries, the regulatory regime around provisioning ofservices to consumer telephonenumbers is unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Furthermore, these regulations and governments' approach to their enforcement, as well asKaleyra'sproducts and services, are still evolving andKaleyramay be unable to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, or enforce compliance byKaleyra'scustomers, on a timely basis or without significant cost. Also, compliance with these types of regulation may require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue.

Additionally, certain of Kaleyra's products and services may be subject to export control and economic sanctions regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration regulations, U.S. Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Controls. Exports of Kaleyra's products and the provision of Kaleyra's services must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The risk factors summarized below could materially harm our business, operating results and/or financial condition, impair our future prospects and/or cause the price of our common stock to decline. These risks are discussed more fully in the sections below. Material risks that may affect our business, operating results and financial condition include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:

• Kaleyra currently generates significant revenue from its largest customers, and the loss or decline in revenue from any of these customers could limit Kaleyra's revenue and results of operations.

• Kaleyra must increase the network traffic and resulting revenue from the services that it offers to realize its targets for anticipated revenue growth, cash flow and operating performance.

• Customers that use many of the features of Kaleyra's services or use Kaleyra's services to support or enable core functionality for their applications may have difficulty or find it impractical to replace Kaleyra's services with a competitor's services, while customers that use only limited functionality may be able to more easily replace Kaleyra's services with competitive offerings.

• Kaleyra is unable to predict the extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic or the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine may adversely impact Kaleyra's business operations, financial performance, results of operations and stock price.

• The market in which Kaleyra participates is highly competitive, and if Kaleyra does not compete effectively, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.

• The length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for Kaleyra's technology offerings and services could delay new sales and cause Kaleyra's revenue and cash flows for any given quarter to fail to meet Kaleyra's projections or market expectations.

• The market for Kaleyra's products and Platforms is still developing, may decline or experience limited growth and is dependent in part on developers continuing to adopt its Platforms and use its products.

• Kaleyra's future success depends in part on its ability to drive the adoption of its products by international customers.

• Kaleyra is in the process of expanding its international operations, which exposes Kaleyra to significant risks.

• Kaleyra's operations are subject to regulation and require Kaleyra to obtain and maintain several governmental licenses and permits. If Kaleyra violates those regulatory requirements or fail to obtain and maintain those licenses and permits, including payment of related fees, if any, Kaleyra may not be able to conduct its business. Moreover, those regulatory requirements could change in a manner that significantly increases Kaleyra's costs or otherwise adversely affects Kaleyra's operations.

• Certain of Kaleyra's products are subject to telecommunications-related regulations, and future legislative or regulatory actions could harm Kaleyra's business.

• The future sales of shares by existing stockholders and future exercise of registration rights may adversely affect the market price of Kaleyra's common stock.

• Kaleyra has limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices for its product.

• Breaches of Kaleyra's networks or systems, or those of Amazon Web Services ("AWS") or Kaleyra's other service providers, could compromise the integrity of its products, Platforms and data, result in significant data losses and otherwise harm its business.

• If Kaleyra loses any of its key personnel or is unable to attract and retain the talent required for its business, Kaleyra's business could be disrupted, and its financial performance could suffer.

• Kaleyra has experienced rapid internal growth as well as growth through acquisitions in recent periods. If Kaleyra fails to manage its growth effectively, or its business does not grow as expected, Kaleyra's operating results may suffer.

• If the benefits of the acquisitions of mGage and Bandyer do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the potential for the market price of Kaleyra's securities may decline.

• If Kaleyra causes disruptions in its customers' businesses or provides inadequate service, Kaleyra's customers may have claims for substantial damages against Kaleyra, which could cause Kaleyra to lose customers, have a negative effect on Kaleyra's reputation, and adversely affect its results of operations.

• If Kaleyra is unable to protect its intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties, its business could be adversely affected.

• Kaleyra's ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.

• Any failure to deliver and maintain high-quality customer support may adversely affectKaleyra'srelationships with its customers and prospective customers and could adversely affectKaleyra'sreputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.

• Defects or errors in Kaleyra's services could diminish demand for Kaleyra's services, harm Kaleyra's business and subject Kaleyra to liability.

• Anti-takeover provisions in Kaleyra's second amended and restated certificate of incorporation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of Kaleyra or changes in its management and, therefore, depress the trading price of its securities.

• Kaleyra has never paid dividends on its capital stock and does not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any profits from an investment in Kaleyra's common stock will depend on whether the price of Kaleyra's common stock increases.

• If Kaleyra is unable to protect its information systems against service interruption or failure, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, its operations could be disrupted, it could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and its reputation may be damaged.

You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report, before making a decision to invest in our securities. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.

Risks Related to Kaleyra's Financial Condition and Operations

The market in which Kaleyra participates is highly competitive, and if Kaleyra does not compete effectively, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.

The CPaaS market is highly competitive and characterized by continuous technological change. The principal competitive factors in this market include completeness of offering, credibility with developers and business users, global reach, ease of integration, product features, platform scalability, brand reputation and awareness, customer support, and the cost of deployment of product offerings. Kaleyra believes that it competes favorably within each of these categories.

Kaleyra competes with several vendors across its various product lines, including:

• Legacy on-premises vendors, such as Avaya Holdings Corp., Cisco Systems, Inc.(through its acquisition of IMIMobile),and SAP SE;

• Direct competitors, such as CLX Communications AB (d/b/a Sinch), Twilio Inc., and Vonage Holdings Corp.;

• Smaller software companies that compete with certain portions of Kaleyra's communications services offerings; and

• SaaS companies that offer prepackaged applications for a narrow set of use cases.

Some competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name and brand recognition, larger sales and marketing efforts and larger portfolios of intellectual property. As a result, certain competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing technologies, opportunities, standards or customer needs and requests. With the introduction of new products and services and new market entrants, Kaleyra expects competition to intensify in the future. Furthermore, as Kaleyra continues to expand the scope of its Platforms, it may face additional competition. Kaleyra is also addressing enterprises that have developed over the years "in-house" products for which Kaleyra can offer a more cost-effective, robust and richer set of products to enhance the total cost of ownership and return on investment for such customers. Kaleyra's current and potential competitors may develop and market new services with comparable functionality to Kaleyra's services, and this could lead to Kaleyra having to decrease prices to remain competitive. If Kaleyra is unable to maintain Kaleyra's current pricing due to the competitive pressures, its margins will be reduced and Kaleyra's business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.

Customers that use many of the features ofKaleyra'sservices or useKaleyra'sservices to support or enable core functionality for their applications may have difficulty or find it impractical to replaceKaleyra'sservices with a competitor's services, while customers that use only limited functionality may be able tomore easily replaceKaleyra'sserviceswith competitive offerings.

With the introduction of new services and new market entrants, Kaleyra expects competition to intensify in the future. In addition, some of Kaleyra's customers choose to use Kaleyra's services and Kaleyra's competitors' services at the same time. Moreover, as Kaleyra expands the scope of Kaleyra's services, Kaleyra may face additional competition. Further, customers and consumers may choose to adopt other forms of electronic communications or alternative communication platforms, including developing necessary networks and platforms in-house.

Furthermore, if Kaleyra's competitors were to merge such that the combined entity would be able to compete fully with Kaleyra's service offering, then Kaleyra's business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. If one or more of Kaleyra's competitors were to merge or partner with another of Kaleyra's competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could also adversely affect Kaleyra's ability to compete effectively. In addition, pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced revenue, reduced margins, increased losses or the failure of Kaleyra's services to achieve or maintain widespread market acceptance.

Kaleyra's current and potential competitors have developed and may develop in the future product solutions that are available internationally. To the extent that customers seek product solutions that include support and scaling internationally, they may choose to use other service providers to fill their communication service needs. Each of these factors could harm Kaleyra's business by leading to reduced revenues, slower growth and lower brand name recognition than Kaleyra's competitors.

Kaleyra currently generates significant revenue from its largest customers, and the loss or decline in revenue from any of these customers could limit Kaleyra's revenue and results of operations.

In the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Kaleyra's 10 largest customers generated an aggregate of 42% and 52% of its revenue, respectively. In the event that Kaleyra's large customers do not continue to use its products, use fewer of its products, or use its products in a more limited capacity, or not at all, Kaleyra's revenue could be limited and Kaleyra's business could be harmed.

Kaleyra must increase the network traffic and resulting revenue from the services that it offers to realize its targets for anticipated revenue growth, cash flow and operating performance.

Approximately 37% of Kaleyra's growth in fiscal year 2021 came from its existing customer base, predominantly through increased traffic volume. Kaleyra must increase the network traffic and resulting revenue from its inbound and outbound voice calling, text messaging, telephone numbers and related services at acceptable margins to realize Kaleyra's targets for anticipated revenue growth, cash flow and operating performance. If Kaleyra does not maintain or improve its current relationships with existing key customers; is not able to expand the available capacity on its network to meet its customers' demands in a timely manner; does not develop new large enterprise customers; or its customers determine to obtain these services from either their own network or from one of Kaleyra's competitors, then Kaleyra may be unable to increase or maintain its revenue at acceptable margins.

Kaleyra has limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices for its product.

Kaleyra charges its customers based on their use of its products. Kaleyra expects that it may need to change its pricing from time to time. In the past Kaleyra has sometimes reduced their prices either for individual customers in connection with long-term agreements or for a particular product. One of the challenges to Kaleyra's pricing is that the fees that they pay to network service providers over whose networks Kaleyra transmits communications can vary daily or weekly and are affected by volume and other factors that may be outside of Kaleyra's control and difficult to predict. This can result in Kaleyra incurring increased costs that Kaleyra may be unable or unwilling to pass through to its customers, which could harm Kaleyra's business.

Kaleyrais seeking to expand its business in the U.S. asKaleyrabelieves that doing so will result in termination fees (which are the pass-through charge to access the network or carrier) that are significantly lower than the termination feesKaleyrais subject to in the other countries where it operates, whichKaleyraexpects would result in higher gross margins, especially with its enterprise customers. However, there are no assurances thatKaleyrawill be successful in this expansion or achieving the related termination fee gross margin improvement.

Further, as competitors introduce new products or services that compete with Kaleyra's or reduce their prices, Kaleyra may be unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers based on Kaleyra's historical pricing. As Kaleyra expands internationally, Kaleyra also must determine the appropriate price to enable Kaleyra to compete effectively internationally. Moreover, enterprises, which are a primary focus for Kaleyra's direct sales efforts, may demand substantial price concessions. In addition, if the mix of products sold changes, including for a shift to Internet protocol ("IP") based products, then Kaleyra may need to, or choose to, revise its pricing. As a result, in the future Kaleyra may be required or choose to reduce its prices or change its pricing model, which could harm Kaleyra's business.

To deliver Kaleyra's products, Kaleyra relies on network service providers and Internet service providers for its network service and connectivity.

Kaleyra currently interconnects with network service providers around the world to enable the use by Kaleyra's customers of its products over their networks. Kaleyra expects that it will continue to rely heavily on network service providers for these services going forward. Kaleyra's reliance on network service providers has reduced Kaleyra's operating flexibility, ability to make timely service changes and control quality of service. In addition, the fees that Kaleyra is charged by network service providers may change daily or weekly, while Kaleyra does not typically change its customers' pricing as rapidly.

At times, some network service providers have instituted additional fees due to regulatory, competitive or other industry related changes that increase Kaleyra network costs. For example, in 2018 Kaleyra was subject to a pricing increase of more than 10% from certain mobile network service providers for delivered messages. While Kaleyra has historically responded to these types of fee increases through a combination of further negotiating efforts with Kaleyra's network service providers, absorbing the increased costs or changing Kaleyra's prices to customers, here Kaleyra identified a unique strategy that allowed it to change its customers prices without affecting Kaleyra's business. There is no guarantee that Kaleyra will continue to be able to use the same strategy in the future without a material negative impact to Kaleyra business. Additionally, Kaleyra's ability to respond to any new fees may be constrained if all network service providers in a particular market impose equivalent fee structures, if the magnitude of the fees is disproportionately large when compared to the underlying prices paid by Kaleyra customers, or if the market conditions limit Kaleyra ability to increase the price Kaleyra charges its customers.

Furthermore, some of these network service providers do not have long-term committed contracts with Kaleyra and may terminate their agreements with Kaleyra without notice or restriction. If a significant portion of Kaleyra's network service providers stop providing Kaleyra with access to their infrastructure, fail to provide these services to Kaleyra on a cost-effective basis, cease operations, or otherwise terminate these services, the delay caused by qualifying and switching to other network service providers could be time consuming and costly and could adversely affect Kaleyra's business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, if problems occur with Kaleyra's network service providers, it may cause errors or poor-quality communications with Kaleyra's products, and it could encounter difficulty identifying the source of the problem. The occurrence of errors or poor-quality communications on Kaleyra's products, whether caused by Kaleyra's Platforms or a network service provider, may result in the loss of Kaleyra's existing customers or the delay of adoption of Kaleyra's products by potential customers and may adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.

Kaleyra also interconnects with Internet service providers around the world to enable the use of Kaleyra's communication products by its customers, and Kaleyra expects that it will continue to rely heavily on Internet service providers for network connectivity going forward. Kaleyra's reliance on Internet service providers reduces Kaleyra's control over quality of service and exposes Kaleyra to potential service outages and rate fluctuations. If a significant portion of Kaleyra's Internet service providers stop providing Kaleyra with access to their network infrastructure, fail to provide access on a cost-effective basis, cease operations, or otherwise terminate access, the delay caused by qualifying and switching to other Internet service providers could be time consuming and costly and could harm Kaleyra's business and operations.

IfKaleyrais unable to expand its relationships with existing technology partner customers and add new technology partner customers,Kaleyra'sbusiness could be harmed.

Kaleyra believes that the continued growth of its business depends in part upon developing and expanding strategic relationships with technology partner customers. Technology partner customers embed Kaleyra software products in their solutions, such as software applications for contact centers and salesforce and marketing automation, and then sell such solutions to other businesses. When potential customers do not have the available developer resources to build their own applications, Kaleyra refers them to either its technology partners who embed Kaleyra's products in the solutions that they sell to other businesses or Kaleyra's consulting partners who provide consulting and development services for organizations that have limited software development expertise to build Kaleyra's Platforms into their software applications.

As part of Kaleyra's growth strategy, it intends to expand Kaleyra's relationships with existing technology partner customers and add new technology partner customers. If Kaleyra fails to expand its relationships with existing technology partner customers or establish relationships with new technology partner customers in a timely and cost-effective manner, or at all, then Kaleyra's business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Additionally, even if Kaleyra is successful at building these relationships but there are problems or issues with integrating Kaleyra's products into the solutions of these customers, Kaleyra's reputation and ability to grow its business may be harmed.

The length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for Kaleyra's technology offerings and services could delay new sales and cause Kaleyra's revenue and cash flows for any given quarter to fail to meet Kaleyra's projections or market expectations.

The timing of the sales cycle from Kaleyra's initial contact with a potential client through the signing of a contract to provide technology offerings and services varies. As a result of the variability and length of the sales cycle, Kaleyra has a limited ability to forecast the timing of new sales. A delay in or failure to complete transactions could harm Kaleyra's business and financial results, and could cause Kaleyra's financial results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Kaleyra's sales cycle varies widely, reflecting differences in Kaleyra's potential customers' decision-making processes, procurement requirements, and budget cycles, and is subject to significant risks over which Kaleyra has little or no control, including:

• Kaleyra's customers' budgetary constraints and priorities;

• the timing of Kaleyra's customers' budget cycles; and

• the length and timing of customers' approval processes.

The market for Kaleyra's products and Platforms is still developing, may decline or experience limited growth and is dependent in part on customers continuing to adopt its Platforms and use its products.

Kaleyra and its subsidiaries have been developing its Platforms to enable business users and developers within organizations to programme voice, messaging and other communications. The market for omnichannel communication with seamless service between communication methods is relatively new and unproven and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Kaleyra believes that its revenue currently constitutes a portion of the total revenue in this market, and therefore, Kaleyra believes that its future success will depend in large part on the growth, if any, of this market. The utilization of APIs by developers and organizations to build communications functionality into their applications is still relatively new, and developers and organizations may not recognize the need for, or benefits of, Kaleyra products and Platforms. Moreover, if they do not recognize the need for and benefits of Kaleyra products and Platforms, they may decide to adopt alternative products and services to satisfy some portion of their business needs.

In order to grow Kaleyra's business and extend Kaleyra's market position, Kaleyra intends to focus on educating developers and business users within organizations about the benefits of Kaleyra products and Platforms, expanding the functionality of Kaleyra products and bringing new technologies to market to increase market acceptance and use of Kaleyra's Platforms. Kaleyra's ability to expand the market that Kaleyra products and Platforms address depends upon a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with such products and Platforms. The market for Kaleyra's products and Platforms could fail to grow significantly

or there could be a reduction in demand forKaleyraproducts as a result of a lack of developer acceptance, technological challenges, competing products and services, decreases in spending by current and prospective customers, weakening economic conditions and other causes. IfKaleyra'smarket does not experience significant growth or demand forKaleyraproducts decreases, thenKaleyra'sbusiness and operations could be harmed.

Kaleyra's Platforms must integrate with a variety of network, hardware, mobile and software platforms and technologies, and its need to continuously modify and enhance Kaleyra's products and Platforms to adapt to changes and innovation in these technologies. For example, Apple, Google and other cell-phone operating system providers or inbox service providers may develop new applications or functions intended to filter spam and unwanted phone calls, messages or other communications. Similarly, Kaleyra's network service providers may adopt new filtering technologies in an effort to combat spam or robocalling. Such technologies may inadvertently filter desired messages or calls to or from Kaleyra's customers. If cell-phone operating system providers, network service providers, Kaleyra's customers or their end-users adopt new software platforms or infrastructure, Kaleyra may be required to develop new versions of its products to work with those new platforms or infrastructure. This development effort may require significant resources, which would adversely affect Kaleyra's business, results of operations and financial condition. Any failure of Kaleyra's products and Platforms to operate effectively with evolving or new platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for Kaleyra's products. If Kaleyra is unable to respond to market changes in a cost-effective manner, Kaleyra's products may become less marketable and less competitive or obsolete.

Kaleyra's future success depends in part on its ability to drive the adoption of its products by international customers.

In the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Kaleyra derived 55.5% and 66.9% of its revenue, respectively, from customer accounts located in Italy and India. Revenue deriving from customer accounts located in the U.S. increased from 17.3% in 2020 to 21.4% in 2021, while revenue deriving from customer accounts located in the European countries other than Italy increased from 6.7% in the year ended December 31, 2020 to 7.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021. Revenues deriving from customer accounts located in South America increased from 0% in 2020 to 7.7% in 2021. Revenue derived from customer accounts located in the rest of the world decreased from 9.1% in 2020 to 8.2% in 2021. This is in line with the expansion strategy out of Italy and India identified by Kaleyra. The future success of Kaleyra's business will depend, in part, on Kaleyra ability to expand its customer base worldwide in new geographies. If Kaleyra is unable to increase the revenue that it derives from international customers, Kaleyra's business and results of operations could be harmed.

Kaleyra's global operations are subject to complex risks, some of which might be beyond its control.

Kaleyra is headquartered in Milan, Italy, has a sizable presence in India and the United States, and operates in other countries throughout the world. In addition, Kaleyra's customers have operations throughout the world, and Kaleyra derives a substantial part of its revenue internationally. As a result, Kaleyra may be subject to risks inherently associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and/or contractual rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including economic sanctions and export control regulations, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas, and other barriers, potential difficulties in collecting trade receivables, international hostilities, such as the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism, and natural disasters. Expansion of international operations also increases the likelihood of potential or actual violations of domestic and international anticorruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or of U.S. and international export control and sanctions regulations. Kaleyra may also face difficulties integrating any new facilities in different countries into its existing operations, as well as integrating employees that it hires in different countries into its existing corporate culture. If Kaleyra is unable to manage the risks of its global operations, its business could be harmed.

Kaleyra is in the process of expanding its international operations, which exposes Kaleyra to significant risks.

Kaleyra is continuing to expand its international operations to increase its revenue from customers outside of Italy, India and the U.S. as part of Kaleyra's growth strategy. Between 2017 and 2021, Kaleyra's international headcount grew from 60 employees to 564 employees. Kaleyra expects to open additional international offices and

hire employees to work at these offices in order to reach new customers and gain access to additional technical talent.Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subjectKaleyrato regulatory,economicand political risks in addition to thoseKaleyraalready faces in Italy, India and the U.S. Because ofKaleyra'slimited experience with international operations or with developing and managing sales in additional international markets beyond Italy and India,Kaleyra'sinternational expansion efforts may not be successful.

In addition, Kaleyra will face risks in doing business internationally that could adversely affect its business, including:

• exposure to political developments and economic and social conditions in the U.S. and other countries in which we are located or do business, and elsewhere as a result of geopolitical developments, such as the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has created an uncertain political and economic environment, disruption and instability for businesses and volatility in global financial markets or which could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy and which therefore could have an adverse impact on our business;

• the difficulty of managing and staffing international operations and the increased operations, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with servicing international customers and operating numerous international locations;

• Kaleyra's ability to effectively price its products in competitive international markets;

• new and different sources of competition;

• Kaleyra's ability to comply with the European Union's GDPR and the privacy regulations of other jurisdictions;

• potentially greater difficulty collecting trade receivables and longer payment cycles;

• higher or more variable network service provider fees outside of the U.S.;

• the need to adapt and localize Kaleyra's products for specific countries;

• the need to offer customer support in various languages;

• difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in various jurisdictions;

• understanding and reconciling different technical standards, data privacy and telecommunications regulations, registration and certification requirements in various jurisdictions, which could prevent customers from deploying Kaleyra's products or limit their usage;

• export controls and economic sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security and the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control or other countries, including the United Kingdom and member countries of the European Union, including those levied against Russia and Russian interests as a result of the actions of Russia in Ukraine, and additional future sanctions and controls;

• compliance with various anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010;

• tariffs and other non-tariff barriers, such as quotas and local content rules;

• more limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;

• adverse tax consequences;

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could increase the price of Kaleyra's products outside of the U.S., increase the expenses of Kaleyra's international operations and expose Kaleyra to foreign currency exchange rate risk;

• currency control regulations, which might restrict or prohibit Kaleyra's conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars;

• restrictions on the transfer of funds;

• deterioration of political relations between various countries; and

• political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region in which Kaleyra operates, which could have an adverse impact on Kaleyra's operations in that location.

Also, due to costs from Kaleyra's international expansion efforts and network service provider fees outside of the U.S., which generally are higher than domestic rates, Kaleyra's gross margin for international customers is typically lower than its gross margin for domestic customers. As a result, Kaleyra's gross margin may be impacted and fluctuate as Kaleyra expands its operations and customer base worldwide.

Kaleyra'sfailure to manage any of these risks successfully could harmKaleyra'sbusiness and international operations.

We contract and otherwise use third parties from throughout the world in furtherance of the provision of our services.

We currently depend on various third-party vendors throughout the world for the provision of our services to our customers. This subjects us to a number of risks ranging from the quality of the services provided to us by such vendors, to the ability of these vendors to be able to provide services to us to the extent that such vendors are themselves impacted by events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, or economic or geopolitical fallout from such events. A Singapore vendor which we use to provide a messaging gateway that we use for some international connections has a majority of its employees in Russia. The imposition of economic sanctions on Russia and Russian entities by many countries, although not targeted towards this entity, could have an impact on the services provided to us by this entity to the extent that such sanctions have an adverse economic effect on the general Russian economy. In addition, sanctions imposed by the U.S., the United Kingdom, the European Union, and other countries against Russia as a result of the military conflict in Ukraine, any related counter-sanctions, and any further escalation of the political tensions or economic instability in the area could have an adverse impact on other third party vendors. If the operations of any third parties providing services to us are disrupted or discontinued due to local instability, political, economic, or military conditions, our ability to provide services to some of our current customers and the development of new products or enhancement of existing products could be delayed, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. We anticipate that we will continue to depend on these and other third-party relationships in order to grow our business for the foreseeable future. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining existing and, if needed, establishing new relationships with third parties, our ability to efficiently operate existing services or develop new services and provide adequate customer support could be impaired, and, as a result, our competitive position or our results of operations could suffer

Kaleyra's operations are subject to regulation and require Kaleyra to obtain and maintain several governmental licenses and permits. If Kaleyra violates those regulatory requirements or fail to obtain and maintain those licenses and permits, including payment of related fees, if any, Kaleyra may not be able to conduct its business. Moreover, those regulatory requirements could change in a manner that significantly increases Kaleyra's costs or otherwise adversely affects Kaleyra's operations.

In the ordinary course of operating Kaleyra's network and providing its services, Kaleyra must obtain and maintain a variety of telecommunications and other licenses and authorizations. Kaleyra also must comply with a variety of regulatory obligations. There can be no assurance Kaleyra can maintain its licenses or that they will be renewed upon their expiration. Kaleyra's failure to obtain or maintain necessary licenses, authorizations or to comply with the obligations imposed upon license holders, including the payment of fees, may cause sanctions or additional costs, including the revocation of authority to provide services.

Kaleyra's operations are subject to regulation at the national level and, often, at the state and local levels. Kaleyra's operations will become subject to additional regulation by other countries as Kaleyra expands to international markets. Changes to existing regulations or rules, or the failure to regulate going forward in areas historically regulated on matters such as network neutrality, licensing fees, environmental, health and safety, privacy, intercarrier compensation, emergency 911 services interconnection and other areas, in general or particular to Kaleyra's industry, may increase costs, restrict operations or decrease revenue. As Kaleyra expands internationally, Kaleyra will also become subject to telecommunications laws and regulations in the foreign countries where Kaleyra offers its products. Kaleyra's international operations are subject to country-specific governmental regulation that may increase its costs or impact its products and Platforms or prevent Kaleyra from offering or providing Kaleyra's products in certain countries. Kaleyra's inability or failure to comply with telecommunications and other laws and regulations could cause the temporary or permanent suspension of Kaleyra's operations, and if Kaleyra cannot provide emergency calling functionality through its Platforms to meet any new federal or state requirements, or any applicable requirements from other countries, the competitive advantages that Kaleyra currently has may not persist, adversely affecting Kaleyra ability to obtain and to retain enterprise customers which could have an adverse impact on Kaleyra's business.

U.S.federal legislation and international laws impose certain obligations on the senders of commercial communications, which could minimize the effectiveness ofKaleyra'sPlatforms, and establish financial penalties for non-compliance, which could increase the costs ofKaleyra'sbusiness.

The CAN-SPAM Act establishes certain requirements for commercial messages and transactional messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. Among other things, the CAN-SPAM Act, obligates the sender of commercial messages to provide recipients with the ability to "opt-out" of receiving future commercial communications from the sender. In addition, some U.S. states have passed laws regulating commercial communication practices that are significantly more restrictive and difficult to comply with than the CAN-SPAM Act. For example, Utah and Michigan prohibit the sending of communication messages that advertise products or services that minors are prohibited by law from purchasing (e.g., alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, illegal drugs) or that contain content harmful to minors (e.g., pornography) to message addresses listed on specified child protection registries. Some portions of these state laws may not be preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act. In addition, certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as Australia, Canada, and the EU, have enacted laws that regulate sending messages, and some of these laws are more restrictive than U.S. laws. For example, some foreign laws prohibit sending broad categories of messages unless the recipient has provided the sender advance consent to receipt of such messages, or in other words has "opted-in" to receiving such communications. If Kaleyra were found to be in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act, applicable state laws governing messages not preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act or foreign laws regulating the distribution of messages, whether as a result of violations by Kaleyra's customers or its own acts or omissions, Kaleyra could be required to pay large penalties, which would adversely affect its financial condition, significantly harm Kaleyra's business, injure Kaleyra's reputation and erode customer trust. The terms of any injunctions, judgments, consent decrees or settlement agreements entered into in connection with enforcement actions or investigations against Kaleyra in connection with any of the foregoing laws may also require Kaleyra to change one or more aspects of the way Kaleyra operates its business, which could impair Kaleyra's ability to attract and retain customers or could increase its operating costs.

Changes in laws and regulations related to the Internet or changes in the Internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for Kaleyra's products.

The future success of Kaleyra's business depends upon the continued use of the Internet as a primary medium for commerce, communications and business applications. U.S. federal, state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the Internet as a commercial medium. Changes in these laws or regulations could require Kaleyra to modify its products and Platforms in order to comply with these changes. In addition, government agencies or private organizations have imposed and may impose additional taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the Internet or commerce conducted via the Internet. These laws or charges could limit the growth of Internet-related commerce or communications generally or result in reductions in the demand for Internet-based products and services such as Kaleyra's products and Platforms. In addition, the use of the Internet as a business tool could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of Internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease-of-use, accessibility and quality of service. The performance of the Internet and its acceptance as a business tool has been adversely affected by "viruses", "worms", and similar malicious programs. If the use of the Internet is reduced as a result of these or other issues, then demand for Kaleyra's products could decline, which could impair Kaleyra's business and reduce its financial results.

Certain of Kaleyra's products are subject to telecommunications-related regulations, and future legislative or regulatory actions could harm Kaleyra's business.

As Kaleyra continues to expand internationally, Kaleyra has become subject to telecommunications laws and regulations in the foreign countries where Kaleyra offers its products. For example, in Italy, Kaleyra holds a license to be a fixed-line operator and is subject to (1) the Electronic Communications Code, or the ECC, which has been enacted with Legislative Decree no. 259/2003, as amended, which transposed a package of European Directives adopted in 2002 and amended in 2009; (2) the National Numbering Plan, issued with AGCom's resolution no. 8/15/CIR as amended, which governs the usage of national numbers for the provision of electronic communications services as a whole; (3) resolutions on the use of alphanumeric indications for the identification of the calling subject in SMS (so-called Alias), that are periodically issued by AGCom, starting from AGCom's resolution no. 42/13/CIR; and (4) GDPR.

Kaleyra'sinternational operations are subject to country-specific governmental regulation and related actions that have increased and may continue to increaseKaleyra'scosts or impact its products and Platformsor preventKaleyrafrom offering or providingKaleyra'sproducts in certain countries. Certain ofKaleyra'sproducts may be used by customers located in countries where voice and other forms of IP communications may be illegal or require special licensing or in countries on a U.S. embargo list. Even whereKaleyra'sproducts are reportedly illegal or become illegal or where users are located in an embargoed country, users in those countries may be able to continue to useKaleyra'sproducts in those countries notwithstanding the illegality or embargo.Kaleyramay be subject to penalties or governmental action if consumers continue to use its products in countries where it is illegal to do so, and any such penalties or governmental action may be costly and may harmKaleyra'sbusiness and damage its brand and reputation.Kaleyramay be required to incur additional expenses to meet applicable international regulatory requirements or be required to discontinue those services if required by law or ifKaleyracannot or will not meet those requirements. Any of the foregoing could harmKaleyra'sbusiness.

If Kaleyra is unable to effectively process local number and toll-free number portability provisioning in a timely manner or to obtain or retain direct inward dialing numbers and local or toll-free numbers, Kaleyra's business and results of operations may be adversely affected.

Kaleyra's future success depends in part on its ability to procure large quantities of local and toll-free direct inward dialing numbers ("DIDs"), in the U.S. and in foreign countries at a reasonable cost and without restrictions. Kaleyra's ability to procure, distribute and retain DIDs depends on factors outside of Kaleyra's control, such as applicable local jurisdiction specific regulations, the practices of network service providers that provide DIDs, such as offering DIDs with conditional minimum volume call level requirements, the cost of these DIDs and the level of overall competitive demand for new DIDs.

In addition, in order to procure, distribute and retain telephone numbers from the EU or certain other regions, Kaleyra may be required to register with the local telecommunications regulatory authorities, some of which have been increasingly monitoring and regulating the categories of phone numbers that are eligible for provisioning to Kaleyra's customers. Kaleyra has registered and is in the process of registering in various countries in which Kaleyra does business, but in some countries, the regulatory regime around provisioning of phone numbers is unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Furthermore, these regulations and governments' approaches to their enforcement, as well as Kaleyra's products and services, are still evolving and Kaleyra may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, or enforce compliance by Kaleyra's customers, on a timely basis or without significant cost. Also, compliance with these types of regulation may require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. If Kaleyra or its customers use phone numbers in these countries in a manner that violates applicable rules and regulations, Kaleyra may also be subject to significant penalties or governmental action, including government-initiated audits and, in extreme cases, may be precluded from doing business in that particular country. In the event of such non-compliance, Kaleyra may be forced to reclaim phone numbers from Kaleyra's customers, which could result in loss of customers, breach of contract claims, loss of revenue, reputational harm, and erosion of customer trust, all of which could harm Kaleyra's business and reputation.

Due to their limited availability, there are certain popular area code prefixes that Kaleyra generally cannot obtain. Kaleyra's inability to acquire or retain DIDs for its operations would make Kaleyra's voice and messaging products less attractive to potential customers in the affected local geographic areas. In addition, future growth in Kaleyra's customer base, together with growth in the customer bases of other providers of cloud communications, has increased, which increases Kaleyra's dependence on sufficiently large quantities of DIDs. It may become increasingly difficult to source larger quantities of DIDs as Kaleyra's scale and its need to pay higher costs for DIDs, and DIDs may become subject to more stringent regulation or conditions of usage such as the registration and on-going compliance requirements discussed above could harm Kaleyra's business.

Kaleyracustomers' and other users' violation ofKaleyra'spolicies or other misuse ofKaleyra'sPlatformsto transmit unauthorized,offensiveor illegal messages, spam, phishing scams, and website links to harmful applications or for other fraudulent or illegal activity could damageKaleyra'sreputation, andKaleyramay face a risk of litigation and liability for unauthorized, inaccurate, or fraudulent information distributed viaKaleyra'sPlatforms.

The actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject Kaleyra to potential risks, including liabilities or claims relating to consumer protection laws. For example, the TCPA restricts telemarketing and the use of automatic text messages without proper consent. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving and developing. If Kaleyra does not comply with these laws or regulations or if Kaleyra becomes liable under these laws or regulations due to the failure of Kaleyra's customers to comply with these laws by obtaining proper consent, Kaleyra could face direct liability.

Moreover, despite Kaleyra's ongoing and substantial efforts to limit such use, certain customers may use Kaleyra's Platforms to transmit unauthorized, offensive or illegal messages, spam, phishing scams, and website links to harmful applications, reproduce and distribute copyrighted material or the trademarks of others without permission, and report inaccurate or fraudulent data or information. These issues also arise with respect to a portion of those users who use Kaleyra's Platforms on a free trial basis. These actions are in violation of Kaleyra's policies. However, Kaleyra's efforts to defeat spamming attacks and other fraudulent activity will not prevent all such attacks and activity, such use of Kaleyra's Platforms could damage Kaleyra's reputation and it could face claims for damages, copyright or trademark infringement, defamation, negligence, or fraud. Moreover, Kaleyra customers' and other users' promotion of their products and services through Kaleyra's Platforms might not comply with U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws. Kaleyra relies on contractual representations made to Kaleyra by its customers that their use of Kaleyra's Platforms will comply with Kaleyra's policies and applicable law, including, without limitation, Kaleyra's message communication policy. Although Kaleyra will retain the right to verify that customers and other users are abiding by certain contractual terms, Kaleyra's Authorized Use Policy and Kaleyra's message communication policy and, in certain circumstances, to review their distribution lists, Kaleyra's customers and other users are ultimately responsible for compliance with Kaleyra's policies, and it does not systematically audit Kaleyra's customers or other users to confirm compliance with Kaleyra's policies. Kaleyra cannot predict whether Kaleyra's role in facilitating its customers' or other users' activities would expose Kaleyra to liability under applicable law. Even if claims asserted against Kaleyra do not result in liability, Kaleyra may incur substantial costs in investigating and defending such claims. If Kaleyra is found liable for its customers' or other users' activities, Kaleyra could be required to pay fines or penalties, redesign business methods or otherwise expend resources to remedy any damages caused by such actions and to avoid future liability.

Kaleyra may be subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions regulations that could impair Kaleyra's ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and could subject Kaleyra to liability if Kaleyra is not in compliance with applicable laws.

Certain of Kaleyra's products and services may be subject to export control and economic sanctions regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration regulations, U.S. Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Controls. Exports of Kaleyra's products and the provision of Kaleyra's services must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. Although Kaleyra takes precautions to prevent its products from being provided in violation of such laws, Kaleyra is aware of previous exports of certain of Kaleyra's products to a small number of persons and organizations that are the subject of U.S. sanctions or located in countries or regions subject to U.S. sanctions. If Kaleyra fails to comply with these laws and regulations, Kaleyra and certain of its employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including: the possible loss of export privileges; fines, which may be imposed on Kaleyra and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular deployment may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. In addition, changes in Kaleyra's products or services, or changes in applicable export or economic sanctions regulations may create delays in the introduction and deployment of Kaleyra's products and services in international markets, or, in some cases, prevent the export of Kaleyra's products or provision of Kaleyra's services to certain countries or end-users. Any change in export or economic sanctions regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations,

could also result in decreased use ofKaleyra'sproducts and services, or in its decreased ability to exportKaleyra'sproducts or provideKaleyra'sservices to existing or prospective customers with international operations. Any decreased use ofKaleyra'sproducts and services or limitation onKaleyra'sability to export its products and provide its services could harmKaleyra'sbusiness.

Further, Kaleyra incorporates encryption technology into certain of its products. Various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit Kaleyra's customers' ability to import its products into those countries. Encryption products and the underlying technology may also be subject to export control restrictions. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of exports of encryption products, or Kaleyra's failure to obtain required approval for Kaleyra's products, when applicable, could harm Kaleyra's international sales and adversely affect Kaleyra's revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of Kaleyra's products and provision of Kaleyra's services, including with respect to new releases of Kaleyra's products and services, may create delays in the introduction of Kaleyra's products and services in international markets, prevent Kaleyra's customers with international operations from deploying its products and using Kaleyra's services throughout their globally-distributed systems or, in some cases, prevent the export of Kaleyra's products or provision of Kaleyra's services to some countries altogether.

In addition, beginning in February 2022, the U.S., the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries began imposing severe sanctions and export controls targeting Russia as a result of the armed conflict by Russia in Ukraine. We, our customers, and our business partners, will be required to comply with these and potential additional sanctions imposed by the U.S., the United Kingdom, the European Union and by other countries. Kaleyra reviews our contractual relationships with suppliers/customers to establish whether any are subject to the sanctions. In the unlikely event of that we identify a party with which we have a business relationship appearing on a sanctions list, we would immediately activate a legal analysis of what gives rise to the business relationship, including any contract, to estimate the most appropriate course of action to comply with the sanction regulations, together with the impact of a contractual termination according to the applicable law, and then proceed as required by the regulatory authorities , However, given the range of possible outcomes, the full costs, burdens, and limitations on our and our customer's and business partners' businesses are currently unknown and may become significant.

Kaleyra faces a risk of litigation resulting from customer misuse of Kaleyra's services and software to make or send unauthorized calls and/or text messages in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.

Calls and/or text messages originated by Kaleyra's customers may subject Kaleyra to potential risks. For example, the TCPA restricts telemarketing and the use of technologies that enable automatic calling and/or text messages without proper consent. This may result in civil claims against Kaleyra and requests for information through third-party subpoenas or regulatory investigations. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the making and/or delivery of calls and/or text messages are continuously evolving and developing. If Kaleyra does not comply with these laws or regulations or if Kaleyra becomes liable under these laws or regulations due to the failure of Kaleyra's customers to comply with these laws by obtaining proper consent, Kaleyra could become subject to lawsuits, fines, civil penalties, potentially significant statutory damages, consent decrees, injunctions, adverse publicity, loss of user confidence in Kaleyra services, loss of users and other adverse consequences, which could harm Kaleyra's business.

The effects of increased regulation in the United States of IP-based service providers are unknown.

While the FCC has to date generally subjected IP-based service providers to less stringent regulatory oversight than traditional common carriers, the FCC has imposed certain regulatory obligations on providers of voice-over-internet protocol ("VoIP") services, including the obligations to contribute to the Universal Service Fund, to provide 911 services and/or to comply with the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. Some states have imposed taxes, fees and/or surcharges on VoIP telephony services. The imposition of additional regulations could have a material adverse effect on Kaleyra's business.

IfKaleyraexperiences fraudulent activity,Kaleyracould incur substantial costs.

Kaleyra's products may be subject to fraudulent usage, including but not limited to revenue share fraud, domestic traffic pumping, subscription fraud, premium text message scams and other fraudulent schemes. Although Kaleyra's customers are required to set passwords or personal identification numbers to protect their accounts, third parties have in the past been, and may in the future be, able to access and use their accounts through fraudulent means. Furthermore, spammers attempt to use Kaleyra's products to send targeted and untargeted spam messages. Kaleyra cannot be certain that its efforts to defeat spamming attacks will be successful in eliminating all spam messages from being sent using Kaleyra's Platforms. In addition, a cybersecurity breach of Kaleyra's customers' systems could result in exposure of their authentication credentials, unauthorized access to their accounts or fraudulent calls on their accounts, any of which could harm Kaleyra's reputation with its customers and result in the incurrence of substantial costs for Kaleyra.

Kaleyra may be liable for the information that content owners or distributors distribute over Kaleyra's network.

The law relating to the liability of private network operators for information carried on or disseminated through their networks remains unsettled. While Kaleyra disclaims any liability for third-party content in Kaleyra's services agreements, Kaleyra may become subject to legal claims relating to the content disseminated on Kaleyra's network, even though such content is owned or distributed by Kaleyra customers or a customer of Kaleyra customers. For example, lawsuits may be brought against Kaleyra claiming that material distributed using Kaleyra's network was inaccurate, offensive or violated the law or the rights of others. Claims could also involve matters such as defamation, invasion of privacy and copyright infringement. In addition, the law remains unclear over whether content may be distributed from one jurisdiction, where the content is legal, into another jurisdiction, where it is not. Companies operating private networks have been sued in the past, sometimes successfully, based on the nature of material distributed, even if the content is not owned by the network operator and the network operator has no knowledge of the content or its legality. It is not practical for Kaleyra to monitor all of the content distributed using Kaleyra's network. Kaleyra may need to take costly measures to reduce Kaleyra's exposure to these risks or to defend itself against such claims, which could increase Kaleyra's costs and harm its results of operations.

Kaleyra has never paid dividends on its common stock, and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future.

Kaleyra has never declared or paid cash dividends on its common stock. Kaleyra does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future. Kaleyra currently intends to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of its business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of Kaleyra's common stock will be stockholders' sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.

Kaleyra has incurred significant indebtedness as a result of the acquisition of mGage, which could have a material adverse effect on Kaleyra's financial condition.

In connection with Kaleyra's acquisition of mGage, Kaleyra incurred $200 million in additional indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, Kaleyra's total consolidated long term indebtedness to banks and other lenders was approximately $22.9 million. Kaleyra may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy its obligations under indebtedness that may not be successful. The inability in the future to repay such indebtedness when due would have a material adverse effect on Kaleyra.

Kaleyra's indebtedness could have important consequences to its stockholders and the holders of its other securities including:

• increasing Kaleyra's vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

• requiring that a portion of Kaleyra's cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest on its debt, thereby reducing its ability to use its cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate requirements;

• limiting Kaleyra's ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate requirements;

• limiting Kaleyra's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business;

• restricting Kaleyra's ability or the ability to pay dividends or make other payments; and

• placing Kaleyra at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors that have less indebtedness.

Kaleyra may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including secured indebtedness. If new indebtedness is added to Kaleyra's current indebtedness levels, the related risks that it faces could intensify.

Risks Related to Kaleyra's Financial Controls

Kaleyra previously had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. If Kaleyra's remediation of these material weaknesses is not effective or if Kaleyra experiences additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, Kaleyra may not be able to produce timely and accurate consolidated financial statements and comply with applicable regulations, which may adversely affect investor confidence and the value of our common stock.

Prior to the Business Combination, Kaleyra was a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. As a result, previously existing internal controls were no longer applicable or comprehensive enough since Kaleyra's operations before the Business Combination were insignificant compared to those of the consolidated entity after the Business Combination. During fiscal year 2020, Kaleyra implemented processes and controls as part of its remediation efforts to address material weaknesses that were identified during the assessment of the year ended December 31, 2019. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Following the remediation of the material weaknesses, Kaleyra's management concluded that Kaleyra's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.

Kaleyra cannot assure that the measures it has taken to date, and the further improvements to strengthen its internal controls that Kaleyra is continuing to implement, will be sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses. Accordingly, there could continue to be a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of Kaleyra's consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

If Kaleyra fails to identify new material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, if Kaleyra is unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, if Kaleyra is unable to conclude that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if its independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting when Kaleyra is no longer an emerging growth company, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of Kaleyra's consolidated financial reports and the market price of Kaleyra's common stock could be negatively affected. As a result of such failures, Kaleyra could also become subject to investigations by the NYSE, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, and become subject to litigation from investors and stockholders, which could harm its reputation and financial condition or divert financial and management resources from Kaleyra's regular business activities.

Kaleyra must continue to develop effective business support systems to implement customer orders and to provide and bill for services.

Kaleyra depends on its ability to continue to develop effective business support systems. This complicated undertaking requires significant resources and expertise and support from third-party vendors. Following the development of the business support systems, the data migration must be completed for the full benefit of the systems to be realized. Business support systems are needed for:

• quoting, accepting and inputting customer orders for services;

• provisioning, installing and delivering services;

• providing customers with direct access to the information systems included in Kaleyra's Platforms so that they can manage the services they purchase from Kaleyra, generally through web-based customer portals; and

• billing for services.

Because Kaleyra's business provides for continued rapid growth in the number of customers that Kaleyra serves, the volume of services offered, as well as the integration of any acquired companies' business support systems, if any, Kaleyra must continue to develop its business support systems on a schedule sufficient to meet proposed milestone dates. If Kaleyra fails to develop effective business support systems or complete the data migration into these systems, it could materially adversely affect Kaleyra's ability to implement its business plans, realize anticipated benefits from Kaleyra's acquisitions, if any, and meet Kaleyra's financial goals and objectives.

Risks Related to Kaleyra's Corporate Structure and Securities

Stockholders of Kaleyra may not be able to enforce judgments entered by U.S. courts against certain of its officers and directors.

Kaleyra is incorporated in the State of Delaware. However, some of our directors and executive officers reside outside of the U.S. As a result, stockholders of Kaleyra may not be able to effect service of process upon those persons within the U.S. or enforce against those persons judgments obtained in U.S. courts.

Kaleyra's second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit Kaleyra's stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with Kaleyra or its directors, officers, employees or stockholders.

Kaleyra's second amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in Kaleyra's name, actions against its directors, officers, and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder's counsel except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, or (D) any action arising under the Securities Act, as to which the Court of Chancery and the federal district court for the District of Delaware shall have concurrent jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of Kaleyra's capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in its second amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with Kaleyra or any of its directors, officers, or employees which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although Kaleyra's stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. However, there is no assurance that a court would enforce the choice of forum provision contained in Kaleyra's second amended and restated certificate of incorporation. If a court were to find such provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, Kaleyra may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm its business, operating results and financial condition.

Kaleyra's second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

The future sales of shares by existing stockholders and future exercise of registration rights may adversely affect the market price ofKaleyra'scommon stock.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of Kaleyra's common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If Kaleyra's stockholders sell, or the market perceives that Kaleyra's stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline.

In connection with their initial purchase of the Company's securities, the Company's initial stockholders were granted registration rights pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement. In connection with the Business Combination, the Company agreed to amend and restate this registration rights agreement with the Registration Rights Agreement. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, after the date of closing of the Business Combination, the sellers' representative under the Stock Purchase Agreement for the Business Combination, Cowen and Company, LLC ("Cowen") or the holders of at least a majority-in-interest of the then-outstanding shares issued to or issuable to the Company's initial stockholders, and the shares issued in the Business Combination (collectively, the "Business Combination Registrable Securities") will be entitled to make up to three demands (not counting any demand by Cowen to register our securities) that we register the Business Combination Registrable Securities. Such registration rights are subject to certain requirements and limitations as set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement. In addition, and subject to certain requirements and limitations as set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, the holders of the Business Combination Registrable Securities have certain "piggy-back" registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our consummation of the Business Combination. The Business Combination Registrable Securities were registered in accordance with the "piggy-back" registration rights for resale on a registration statement that the SEC declared effective in May 2020. The Company has also agreed to provide certain registration rights to unregistered shares of common stock and shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to outstanding convertible notes with certain stockholders of the Company. Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, ("Chardan") currently holds 66,089 shares of common stock and a convertible note that is convertible at Chardan's option into 53,501 shares of common stock, all of which are subject to such registration rights.

In addition, Kaleyra issued 1,600,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock as partial consideration to the existing stockholders of Vivial in connection with the acquisition of mGage, and registered such transaction and issuance on a registration statement on Form S-4 on May 6, 2021. In connection with the acquisition, Kaleyra issued 8,400,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock to the PIPE Investors and the Merger Convertible Notes are convertible into up to 11,851,852 shares of Kaleyra common stock. Kaleyra registered the resale of the 8,400,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock issued to the PIPE Investors and the resale of the Kaleyra common stock issuable upon conversion of the Merger Convertible Notes (the "Resale Registration Statement"). The Resale Registration Statement was declared effective in May 2021.

Conversion of the Merger Convertible Notes that were issued in connection with the acquisition of mGage will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the market price of Kaleyra common stock.

The conversion of some or all of the Merger Convertible Notes issued in connection with the acquisition of mGage will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the shares of Kaleyra common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of Kaleyra common stock. In addition, the existence of the Merger Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Merger Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Merger Convertible Notes into shares of Kaleyra common stock could depress the market price of Kaleyra common stock.

Warrants are exercisable for Kaleyra's common stock, and upon any exercise would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to Kaleyra's stockholders.

Kaleyra has outstanding issued warrants to purchase a total of 5,440,662 shares of common stock. Each whole warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of common stock at $11.50 per share. To the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the then existing holders of the common stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the common stock.

Kaleyrahas no obligation to net cash settle the warrants.

In no event does Kaleyra have any obligation to net cash settle the warrants. Furthermore, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the warrants upon exercise of the warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.

Certain of our warrants are accounted for as a warrant liability and are recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of Kaleyra common stock.

Kaleyra has 373,691 warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2021 that were issued in private placements that occurred concurrently with its initial public offering (the "private warrants"). These private warrants and the shares of Kaleyra common stock issuable upon the exercise of the private warrants are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder's option, and are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the private warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the private warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units sold in the Company's initial public offering, in which case the 373,691 private warrants could be redeemed by the Company for $3,737. Under U.S. GAAP, Kaleyra is required to evaluate contingent exercise provisions of these warrants and then their settlement provisions to determine whether they should be accounted for as a warrant liability or as equity. Any settlement amount not equal to the difference between the fair value of a fixed number of Kaleyra's equity shares and a fixed monetary amount precludes these warrants from being considered indexed to its own stock, and therefore, from being accounted for as equity. As a result of the provision that the private warrants, when held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, will be redeemable by the Company, the requirements for accounting for these warrants as equity are not satisfied. Therefore, Kaleyra is required to account for these private warrants as a warrant liability and record (a) that liability at fair value, which was determined as the same as the fair value of the warrants included in the units sold in the Company's initial public offering, and (b) any subsequent changes in fair value as of the end of each period for which earnings are reported. As the fair value of the warrants was not considered material to the historical consolidated financial statements, it was recorded in the consolidated financial statements during the year ended December 31, 2021. The impact of changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverse effect on the market price of Kaleyra common stock.

Kaleyra may redeem the unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to warrant holders, thereby making the holders' warrants worthless.

Kaleyra has the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of the common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date Kaleyra sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. If and when the warrants become redeemable by Kaleyra, Kaleyra may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force holders (i) to exercise their warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for the holders to do so, (ii) to sell their warrants at the then-current market price when the holders might otherwise wish to hold their warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of the warrants. None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by Kaleyra so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.

Anti-takeover provisions contained in the second amended and restated certificate of incorporation as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.

The second amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. Kaleyra is also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for Kaleyra's securities.

The fundamental change repurchase feature of the Merger Convertible Notes that were issued in connection with the acquisition ofmGagemay delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take overKaleyra.

The terms of the Merger Convertible Notes require Kaleyra to repurchase the Merger Convertible Notes that were issued in connection with the acquisition of mGage for cash at the option of the holder in the event of a fundamental change and in certain circumstances require us to increase the conversion rate for conversions in connection with (i) a make-whole fundamental change or (ii) the delivery of a notice of redemption. A takeover of Kaleyra may trigger an option of the holder to require Kaleyra to repurchase the Merger Convertible Notes. These features may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of Kaleyra that would otherwise be beneficial to investors in the Merger Convertible Notes or Kaleyra's other securities.

Kaleyra's structure may be inefficient from a tax perspective.

Kaleyra S.p.A. is a controlled foreign corporation of Kaleyra for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This means that a substantial part of the net income, if any, of Kaleyra S.p.A. and its non‑U.S. subsidiaries will be taxable to Kaleyra without regard to whether a dividend is paid to Kaleyra, subject to available foreign tax credits and a special deduction. Moreover, because Kaleyra S.p.A. has a U.S. subsidiary, the resulting structure (sometimes referred to as a "sandwich structure") would be subject to multiple levels of tax. Generally speaking, it is difficult to simplify a sandwich structure without incurring taxes in one or more jurisdictions. This corporate structure may have the effect of Kaleyra being required to pay more taxes than other companies with a simpler corporate structure.

General Risk Factors

If Kaleyra is unable to expand or renew sales to existing clients, or attract new customers, Kaleyra's growth could be slower than it expects and its business may be harmed.

Kaleyra's future growth depends upon expanding sales of Kaleyra's technology offerings and services with existing customers and with new customers. Kaleyra's customers may not purchase Kaleyra's technology offerings and services, or Kaleyra's customers may reduce their purchasing volumes, if Kaleyra does not demonstrate the value proposition for their investment, and Kaleyra may not be able to replace existing customers with new customers. In addition, Kaleyra's customers may not renew their contracts with Kaleyra on the same terms, or at all, because of dissatisfaction with Kaleyra's service. If Kaleyra's customers do not renew their contracts, Kaleyra's revenue may grow more slowly than expected, may not grow at all, or may decline. Additionally, increasing incremental sales to Kaleyra's current client base may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Kaleyra plans to continue expanding its sales efforts but it may be unable to hire qualified sales personnel, may be unable to successfully train those sales personnel that Kaleyra is able to hire, and sales personnel may not become fully productive on the timelines that it has projected, or at all. Additionally, although Kaleyra dedicates significant resources to sales and marketing programs, these sales and marketing programs may not have the desired effect and may not expand sales. Kaleyra cannot make any assurances that its efforts will increase sales to existing customers or additional revenue. If Kaleyra's efforts to upsell to its customers are not successful, its future growth may be limited.

Kaleyra's ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will also depend upon its ability to attract new customers. This may be particularly challenging where an organization has already invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate competing technology offerings and services into its business, as such organization may be reluctant or unwilling to invest in new technology offerings and services. If Kaleyra fails to attract new customers and maintain and expand those client relationships, its revenue may grow more slowly than expected and its business may be harmed.

Kaleyra's business depends on customers increasing their use of Kaleyra's services and any loss of customers or decline in their use of Kaleyra's services could reduce Kaleyra's profitability.

Kaleyra's ability to grow and generate incremental revenue depends, in part, on Kaleyra's ability to maintain and grow its relationships with existing customers and to have them increase their usage of Kaleyra's Platforms. If Kaleyra's customers do not increase their use of Kaleyra's services, then Kaleyra's revenue may decline and Kaleyra's results of operations may be harmed. Customers generally are charged based on the usage of Kaleyra's services. Many of Kaleyra's customers do not have long-term contractual financial commitments to Kaleyra and,

therefore, many ofKaleyra'scustomers may reduce or cease their use ofKaleyra'sservices at any time without penalty or termination charges.Kaleyracannot accurately predict customers' usage levels and the loss of customers or reductions in their usage levels ofKaleyra'sservices may each have a negative impact onKaleyra'sbusiness, results of operations and financial condition and may causeKaleyra'sdollar-based net retention rate to decline in the future ifKaleyra'scustomers are not satisfied withKaleyra'sservices. If a significant number of customers cease using, or reduce their usage of,Kaleyra'sservices, thenKaleyramay be required to spend significantly more on sales and marketing thanKaleyra'scurrently plan to spend in order to maintain or increase revenue from customers. Such additional sales and marketing expenditures could reduceKaleyra'sprofitability and harm its business.

Demand for Kaleyra's technology offerings and services could be adversely affected by volatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on Kaleyra's customers' businesses.

Kaleyra's revenue and profitability depend on the demand for its technology offerings and services, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond Kaleyra's control. Volatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions affect Kaleyra's customers' businesses and the markets Kaleyra serves. Such economic conditions in Kaleyra's markets have undermined, and could in the future undermine, business confidence in Kaleyra's markets and cause Kaleyra's customers to reduce or defer their spending on new technology offerings and services, or may result in customers reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with Kaleyra, which would negatively affect Kaleyra's business. Growth in the markets Kaleyra serves could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case for an extended period of time. Ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect Kaleyra's business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build Kaleyra's revenue and resource plans.

Economic volatility and uncertainty are particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in Kaleyra's business and results of operations. Changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could harm Kaleyra's business and results of operations.

Breaches of Kaleyra's networks or systems, or those of AWS or Kaleyra's other service providers, could compromise the integrity of its products, Platforms and data, result in significant data losses and otherwise harm its business.

Kaleyra depends upon its information technology ("IT") systems to conduct virtually all of its business operations, ranging from Kaleyra's internal operations and research and development activities to its marketing and sales efforts and communications with Kaleyra's customers and business partners. Individuals or entities may attempt to penetrate Kaleyra's network security, or that of its Platforms, and to cause harm to Kaleyra's business operations, including by misappropriating its proprietary information or that of its customers, employees and business partners or to cause interruptions of Kaleyra's products and Platforms. In particular, cyberattacks and other malicious Internet-based activity continue to increase in frequency and in magnitude generally, and cloud-based companies have been targeted in the past. In addition to threats from traditional computer hackers, malicious code (such as malware, viruses, worms, and ransomware), employee theft or misuse, password spraying, phishing, credential stuffing, and denial-of-service attacks, Kaleyra also faces threats from sophisticated organized crime, nation-state, and nation-state supported actors who engage in attacks (including advanced persistent threat intrusions) that add to the risk to Kaleyra's systems (including those hosted on AWS or other cloud services), internal networks, its customers' systems and the information that they store and process. While Kaleyra devotes significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures, because the techniques used by such individuals or entities to access, disrupt or sabotage devices, systems and networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, Kaleyra may be required to make further investments over time to protect data and infrastructure as cybersecurity threats develop, evolve and grow more complex over time. Kaleyra may also be unable to anticipate these techniques, and Kaleyra may not become aware in a timely manner of such a security breach, which could exacerbate any damage Kaleyra experiences. Additionally, Kaleyra depends upon its employees and contractors to appropriately handle confidential and sensitive data, including customer data, and to deploy Kaleyra's IT resources in a safe and secure manner that does not expose Kaleyra's network systems to security breaches or the loss of data. Any data security incidents, including internal malfeasance by its employees or a third party's fraudulent inducement of Kaleyra's employees to disclose information, unauthorized access or usage, virus or similar breach or disruption of Kaleyra's or its service providers, such as

AWS or service providers, could result in loss of confidential information, damage toKaleyra'sreputation, erosion of customer trust, loss of customers, litigation,regulatory investigations, fines, penalties and other liabilities. Accordingly, ifKaleyra'scybersecurity measures or those of AWS orKaleyra'sservice providers, fail to protect against unauthorized access, attacks (which may include sophisticated cyberattacks), compromise or the mishandling of data byKaleyra'semployees and contractors, thenKaleyra'sreputation, customer trust, business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. WhileKaleyramaintains errors, omissions, and cyber liability insurance policies covering certain security and privacy damages,Kaleyracannot be certain that its existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover the potentially significant losses that may result from a security incident or breach or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.

Kaleyra's investments in new services and technologies may not be successful.

Kaleyra continues to invest in new services and technologies. The complexity of these solutions, Kaleyra's learning curve in developing and supporting them, and significant competition in the markets for these solutions could make it difficult for Kaleyra to market and implement these solutions successfully. Additionally, there is a risk that Kaleyra's customers may not adopt these solutions widely, which would prevent Kaleyra from realizing expected returns on these investments. Even if these solutions are successful in the market, they still rely on third-party hardware and software and Kaleyra's ability to meet stringent service levels. If Kaleyra is unable to deploy these solutions successfully or profitably, it could adversely impact its business.

If Kaleyra fails to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changing regulations, and changing customer needs, requirements or preferences, Kaleyra's products may become less competitive.

The market for communications in general, and cloud communications in particular, is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changing regulations, as well as changing customer needs, requirements and preferences. The success of Kaleyra's business will depend, in part, on Kaleyra's ability to adapt and respond effectively to these changes on a timely basis. If Kaleyra is unable to develop new products that satisfy Kaleyra customers and provide enhancements and new features for Kaleyra's existing products that keep pace with rapid technological and industry change, Kaleyra business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. If new technologies emerge that are able to deliver competitive products and services at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely, such technologies could adversely impact Kaleyra's ability to compete effectively.

If Kaleyra loses any of its key personnel or is unable to attract and retain the talent required for its business, Kaleyra's business could be disrupted and its financial performance could suffer.

Kaleyra's success is heavily dependent upon its ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain key personnel to manage and grow its business, including Kaleyra's key executive, management, sales, services, and technical personnel.

Kaleyra's future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of Kaleyra's executive team including the leadership of Kaleyra's Chief Executive Officer, Dario Calogero, as well as the continued service and support of other key employees. Kaleyra's future success also will depend on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technology specialists, engineers, and consultants, for whom the market is extremely competitive. All of Kaleyra's officers and key employees are at-will employees, meaning that they can terminate their employment with Kaleyra at any time. Kaleyra's inability to attract, develop, and retain key personnel could have an adverse effect on its relationships with its technology partners and customers and adversely affect Kaleyra's ability to expand its offerings of technology offerings and services. Moreover, Kaleyra's inability to train its sales, services, and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology needs of its customers could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel. Such consequences could harm Kaleyra's business.

Kaleyra's ability to attract and retain business and personnel may depend on its reputation in the marketplace.

Kaleyra believes its brand name and its reputation in the marketplace are important corporate assets that help distinguish Kaleyra's technology offerings and services from those of competitors and also contribute to Kaleyra's

ability to recruit and retain talented personnel, in particular its engineers and consulting professionals. However,Kaleyra'scorporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with customers, cybersecurity breaches, service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, or compliance violations. Similarly,Kaleyra'sreputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former customers, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, partners,Kaleyra'sjoint ventures or joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators, or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media. There is a risk that negative information aboutKaleyra, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect its business. Damage toKaleyra'sreputation could be difficult,expensiveand time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing customers reluctant to selectKaleyrafor new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affectKaleyra'srecruitment and retention efforts. Damage toKaleyra'sreputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness ofKaleyra'sbrand name and could reduce investor confidence inKaleyra, adversely affecting its share price.

Kaleyra has experienced rapid internal growth as well as growth through acquisitions in recent periods. If Kaleyra fails to manage its growth effectively, or its business does not grow as expected, Kaleyra's operating results may suffer.

Kaleyra's headcount and operations have grown substantially. Kaleyra had 564 employees as of December 31, 2021, as compared with 350 employees as of December 31, 2020. This growth has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on Kaleyra's operational, financial, and management infrastructure. Kaleyra anticipates further increases in headcount will be required to support increases in its technology offerings and continued expansion. To manage this growth effectively, Kaleyra must continue to improve its operational, financial, and management systems as well as controls by, among other things:

• effectively attracting, training, and integrating a large number of new employees, particularly technical personnel and members of Kaleyra's management and sales teams;

• further improving Kaleyra's key business systems, processes, and information technology infrastructure to support Kaleyra's business needs;

• enhancing Kaleyra's information and communication systems to ensure that Kaleyra's employees are well-coordinated and can effectively communicate with each other and Kaleyra's customers; and

• improving Kaleyra's internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely and accurate reporting of Kaleyra's operational and financial results.

If Kaleyra fails to manage its expansion or implement Kaleyra's new systems, or if Kaleyra fails to implement improvements or maintain effective internal controls and procedures, Kaleyra's costs and expenses may increase more than expected and Kaleyra may not expand its client base, increase existing customer volumes and renewal rates, enhance its existing applications, develop new applications, satisfy its customers, respond to competitive pressures, or otherwise execute its business plan. If Kaleyra is unable to manage its growth, Kaleyra's operating results likely will be harmed.

Future acquisitions could disrupt Kaleyra's business and may divert management's attention, and if unsuccessful, harm Kaleyra's business.

Kaleyra may choose to expand by making acquisitions that could be material to its business. Acquisitions involve many risks, including the following:

• an acquisition may negatively affect Kaleyra's results of operations and financial condition because it may require Kaleyra to incur charges or assume substantial debt or other liabilities, may cause adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose Kaleyra to claims and disputes by third parties, including intellectual property claims and disputes, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisition;

• Kaleyra may encounter difficulties or unforeseen expenditures in integrating the business, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of any company that it acquires, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for Kaleyra;

• an acquisition may disrupt its ongoing business, divert resources, increaseKaleyra'sexpenses, or distract its management;

• an acquisition may result in a delay or reduction of client purchases for both Kaleyra and the company it acquired due to client uncertainty about continuity and effectiveness of service from either company;

• Kaleyra may encounter difficulties in, or may be unable to, successfully sell any acquired technology offerings or services;

• an acquisition may involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which Kaleyra has little or no prior experience or where competitors have stronger market positions;

• the challenges inherent in effectively managing an increased number of employees in diverse locations;

• the potential strain on its financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures;

• the potential known and unknown liabilities associated with an acquired company;

• Kaleyra's use of cash to pay for acquisitions would limit other potential uses for its cash;

• if Kaleyra incurs additional debt to fund such acquisitions, such debt may subject Kaleyra to additional material restrictions on its ability to conduct its business as well as additional financial maintenance covenants;

• the risk of impairment charges related to potential write-downs of acquired assets or goodwill in future acquisitions;

• to the extent that Kaleyra issues a significant amount of equity or equity-linked securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease; and

• managing the varying intellectual property protection strategies and other activities of an acquired company.

Kaleyra may not succeed in addressing these or other risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the integration of any acquired business. The inability to integrate successfully the business, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of any acquired business, or any significant delay in achieving integration, could harm its business and results of operations.

The combination of the Kaleyra and mGage businesses may not lead to the growth and success of the combined business that Kaleyra believes will occur.

Although Kaleyra believes the combination of the Kaleyra and mGage businesses provides a significant commercial opportunity for growth, Kaleyra may not realize all of the synergies that it anticipates and may not be successful in implementing its commercialization strategy. The combined business will be subject to all of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the pursuit of growth in the CPaaS industry and Kaleyra may not be able to successfully sell its and mGage's products and services, or realize the anticipated benefits expected as part of the combination of the two businesses. If Kaleyra is not able to grow the combined business as a commercial enterprise, its financial condition will be negatively impacted.

Although Kaleyra expects to realize certain benefits as a result of the acquisition of mGage, there is the possibility Kaleyra may be unable to integrate successfully the business of mGage to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or do so within the intended timeframe.

Following the acquisition of mGage, Kaleyra is devoting significant management attention and resources to the integration of the business practices and operations of Kaleyra and mGage. Potential difficulties that Kaleyra may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:

• the costs of integration and compliance and the possibility that the full benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition will not be realized;

• any delay in the integration of management teams, strategies, operations, products and services;

• diversion of the attention of management as a result of integrating the mGage business into Kaleyra;

• lack of going-forward commitment of mGage customers, based on fatigue, loss of trust, disapproval or the directions of mGage pre-acquisition, or Kaleyra post-acquisition;

• loss of customers that will consider Kaleyra to be a competitor post-acquisition, or due to the acquisition of a customer by a competitor to Kaleyra;

• differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies that may delay successful integration;

• the ability to create and enforce uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;

• the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of mGage into those of Kaleyra in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;

• potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the integration of mGage;

• the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our ongoing businesses; and

• the potential unknown and undisclosed technical deficiencies and lack of required features and functionalities at the mGage products and services that will prevent the deployment and sale of those products and services. It is only through our interactions with the customers during the months following the acquisition that we will be able to define whether our products are salable and deployable whatsoever, or are not competitive, and hence will not be capable of generating meaningful revenue.

Any of these factors could adversely affect the ability of Kaleyra to benefit financially from the acquisition of mGage, maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or its ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of mGage or could reduce or even completely diminish the earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of Kaleyra.

Kaleyra expects to continue incur additional integration and consolidation related costs related to the integration of the mGage business.

Kaleyra completed the acquisition of the mGage business on June 1, 2021. Kaleyra has incurred and expects to incur non-recurring costs associated with integrating the operations of mGage into its business. The amount of these costs could be material to the financial position and results of operations of Kaleyra. A substantial amount of such expenses includes facilities and systems consolidation costs, implementing integration plans, and employee-related costs. The combined company has and will continue to incur restructuring and integration costs in connection with the acquisition. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred, as there are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the acquisition and the integration of the two companies' businesses. The elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may not offset incremental transaction and other integration related costs in the near term or at all.

Kaleyra may not have discovered undisclosed liabilities and product deficiencies of mGage.

Kaleyra's due diligence review of mGage may not have discovered undisclosed liabilities and product and service deficiencies of mGage. If mGage has undisclosed liabilities or product or service deficiencies, Kaleyra as a successor owner may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities. Kaleyra has tried to control its exposure to undisclosed liabilities by obtaining certain protections as contemplated and provided for under the Merger Agreement, including representations and warranties from mGage regarding undisclosed liabilities, however, such representations and warranties expire by their terms on the completion of the Merger. There can be no assurance that such provisions in the Merger Agreement will protect Kaleyra against any undisclosed liabilities or product or service deficiencies being discovered or provide an adequate remedy for any undisclosed liabilities that are discovered. Such undisclosed liabilities could have an adverse effect on the business and results of operations of Kaleyra and may adversely affect the value of Kaleyra common stock after the consummation of the Merger.

Uncertainties associated with the integration of themGagebusiness may cause a loss of employees and may otherwise materially adversely affect the future business and operations ofKaleyrafollowing the Merger.

Kaleyra's success depends upon the ability of Kaleyra to retain senior management and key employees of Kaleyra and mGage. In some of the fields in which Kaleyra and mGage operate, there are only a limited number of people in the job market who possess the requisite skills, and it may be increasingly difficult for Kaleyra to hire personnel over time. Kaleyra operates in many geographic locations where the labor markets, especially for software engineers, are particularly competitive.

Current and prospective employees of Kaleyra and mGage may experience uncertainty about their roles with Kaleyra following the integration of the mGage business. In addition, key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with Kaleyra. The loss of services of certain senior management or key employees of Kaleyra and mGage or the inability to hire new personnel with the requisite skills could restrict the ability of Kaleyra to develop new products or enhance existing products in a timely manner, or to sell products to customers or to manage the business of Kaleyra following the integration effectively. Also, the business, financial condition and results of operations of Kaleyra following the integration could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by Kaleyra's inability to attract and retain skilled employees, particularly engineers.

Kaleyra may experience quarterly fluctuations in its operating results due to a number of factors, which makes its future results difficult to predict and could cause its operating results to fall below expectations.

Kaleyra's quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and Kaleyra expects them to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of Kaleyra's control. As a result, Kaleyra's past results may not be indicative of its future performance and comparing Kaleyra's operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to the other risks described in this Annual Report, factors that may affect Kaleyra's quarterly operating results include:

• changes in spending on collaboration and technology offerings and services by Kaleyra's current or prospective customers;

• pricing Kaleyra's technology offerings and services effectively so that Kaleyra is able to attract and retain customers without compromising its operating results;

• attracting new customers and increasing Kaleyra's existing customers' use of Kaleyra's technology offerings and services;

• the mix between wholesale and retail maintenance new contracts and renewals;

• client renewal rates and the amounts for which agreements are renewed;

• seasonality and its effect on client demand;

• awareness of Kaleyra's brand;

• changes in the competitive dynamics of Kaleyra's market, including consolidation among competitors or customers and the introduction of new technologies and technology enhancements;

• changes to the commission plans, quotas, and other compensation-related metrics for Kaleyra's sales representatives;

• the amount and timing of payment for operating expenses, particularly sales and marketing expense;

• Kaleyra's ability to manage its existing business and future growth, domestically and internationally;

• unforeseen costs and expenses related to the expansion of Kaleyra's business, operations, and infrastructure, including disruptions in Kaleyra's hosting network infrastructure and privacy and data security; and

• general economic and political conditions in Kaleyra's domestic and international markets.

Kaleyra may not be able to accurately forecast the amount and mix of future technology offerings and services, size or duration of contracts, revenue, and expenses and, as a result, Kaleyra's operating results may fall below its estimates. Risks related to confidentiality and security provisions or privacy laws will increase as Kaleyra continues to grow its cloud-based offerings and services and store and process increasingly large amounts of Kaleyra's customers' confidential information and data and host or manage parts of Kaleyra's customers' businesses, especially in industries involving particularly sensitive data such as the financial services industry and the healthcare industry. The loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, including personal data, whether through breach of computer systems, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or otherwise, could damage Kaleyra's reputation and cause it to lose customers. Similarly, unauthorized access to or through Kaleyra's information systems and networks or those Kaleyra develops or manages for its customers, whether by Kaleyra's employees or third parties, could result in negative publicity, legal liability, and damage to Kaleyra's reputation, which could in turn harm Kaleyra's business and results of operations.

If Kaleyra causes disruptions in its customers' businesses or provides inadequate service, Kaleyra's customers may have claims for substantial damages against Kaleyra, which could cause Kaleyra to lose customers, have a negative effect on Kaleyra's reputation, and adversely affect its results of operations.

If Kaleyra makes errors in the course of delivering services for its customers or business partners, or fails to consistently meet its service level obligations or other service requirements of Kaleyra's customers, these errors or failures could disrupt Kaleyra's client's business, which could result in a reduction in its revenue or a claim for substantial damages against Kaleyra. In addition, a failure or inability by Kaleyra to meet a contractual requirement could subject Kaleyra to penalties, cause Kaleyra to lose customers or damage Kaleyra's brand or corporate reputation, and limit Kaleyra's ability to attract new business.

The services Kaleyra provides are often critical to Kaleyra's customers' businesses. Certain of Kaleyra's client contracts require Kaleyra to comply with security obligations including maintaining network security and backup data, ensuring Kaleyra's network is virus-free, maintaining business continuity planning procedures, and verifying the integrity of employees that work with Kaleyra's customers by conducting background checks. Any failure in a client's system, failure of Kaleyra's data center, cloud or other offerings, or breach of security relating to the services Kaleyra provides to the client could damage Kaleyra's reputation or result in a claim for substantial damages against Kaleyra. Any significant failure of Kaleyra's equipment or systems, or any major disruption to basic infrastructure in the locations in which Kaleyra operates, such as power and telecommunications, could impede Kaleyra's ability to provide services to Kaleyra's customers, have a negative impact on Kaleyra's reputation, cause Kaleyra to lose customers, and adversely affect its results of operations.

Under Kaleyra's client contracts, Kaleyra's liability for breach of its obligations is in some cases limited pursuant to the terms of the contract. Such limitations may be unenforceable or otherwise may not protect it from liability for damages. In addition, certain liabilities, such as claims of third parties for which Kaleyra may be required to indemnify its customers, are generally not limited under Kaleyra's contracts. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against Kaleyra in amounts greater than those covered by Kaleyra's current insurance policies could harm Kaleyra's financial condition. Even if such assertions against it are unsuccessful, Kaleyra may incur reputational harm and substantial legal fees.

Kaleyra's technology offerings and services could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or Kaleyra might lose its ability to utilize the intellectual property of others.

Kaleyra cannot be sure that its brand, technology offerings, and services, including, for example, the software solutions of others that Kaleyra offers to its customers, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that Kaleyra or its customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. These claims could harm Kaleyra's reputation, cause Kaleyra to incur substantial costs or prevent Kaleyra from offering some services or solutions in the future or require Kaleyra to rebrand. Any related proceedings could require Kaleyra to expend significant resources over an extended period of time. In most of Kaleyra's contracts, Kaleyra agrees to indemnify its customers for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Any claims or litigation in this area, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and costly, damage Kaleyra's reputation, and/or require Kaleyra to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to its customers. If Kaleyra cannot secure this right

at all or on reasonable terms, or, alternatively, substitute a non-infringing technology,Kaleyra'sbusiness, results of operations, or financial condition could be harmed. Similarly, ifKaleyrais unsuccessful in defending a trademark claim,Kaleyracould be forced to re-brand, which could harm its business, results of operations, or financial condition. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets where their sole or primary purpose is to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology. Any such action namingKaleyraor its customers could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment againstKaleyra. Moreover, such an action could result in an injunction being ordered againstKaleyra'sclient orKaleyra'sown services or operations, causing further damages.

If Kaleyra is unable to protect its intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties, its business could be adversely affected.

Kaleyra's success depends, in part, upon its ability to protect its proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property. Existing laws offer only limited protection of Kaleyra's intellectual property rights, and the protection in some countries in which Kaleyra operates or may operate in the future may be very limited. Kaleyra relies upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws to protect its intellectual property rights. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit its ability to protect its intellectual property. There is uncertainty concerning the scope of available intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which Kaleyra relies on intellectual property laws to protect its rights. The validity and enforceability of any intellectual property right Kaleyra obtains may be challenged by others and, to the extent it has enforceable intellectual property rights, those intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from reverse engineering its proprietary information or independently developing technology offerings and services similar to or duplicative of Kaleyra. Further, the steps Kaleyra takes in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of its intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and Kaleyra might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, its intellectual property rights. Enforcing Kaleyra's rights might also require considerable time, money, and oversight, and Kaleyra may not be successful in enforcing its rights.

Kaleyra's use of open source software could negatively affect its ability to sell Kaleyra's products and subject Kaleyra to possible litigation.

Kaleyra's products and Platforms incorporate open source software, and Kaleyra expects to continue to incorporate open source software in its products and Platforms in the future. Few of the licenses applicable to open source software have been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on Kaleyra's ability to commercialize its products and Platforms. Moreover, although Kaleyra has implemented policies to regulate the use and incorporation of open source software into Kaleyra's products and Platforms, Kaleyra cannot be certain that it has not incorporated open source software in Kaleyra products or Platforms in a manner that is inconsistent with such policies. If Kaleyra fails to comply with open source licenses, Kaleyra may be subject to certain requirements, including requirements that it offer Kaleyra's products that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that Kaleyra make available source code for modifications or derivative works Kaleyra creates based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and that it license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of applicable open source licenses. If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that Kaleyra has not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, Kaleyra could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from generating revenue from customers using products that contained the open source software and required to comply with onerous conditions or restrictions on these products. In any of these events, Kaleyra and its customers could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering Kaleyra's products and Platforms and to re-engineer Kaleyra's products or Platforms or discontinue offering its products to customers in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis. Any of the foregoing could require Kaleyra to devote additional research and development resources to re-engineer Kaleyra's products or Platforms, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and could harm Kaleyra's business.

IfKaleyrais unable to collect its receivables from, or bill its unbilled services to its customers, its business and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Kaleyra's business depends on its ability to successfully obtain payment from its customers of the amounts they owe Kaleyra for technology offerings sold or services performed. Kaleyra typically evaluates the financial condition of its customers and usually bills and collects on relatively short cycles. Kaleyra maintains allowances against receivables and unbilled services. Actual losses on client balances could differ from those that Kaleyra currently anticipate and, as a result, Kaleyra might need to adjust its allowances. There is no guarantee that Kaleyra will accurately assess the creditworthiness of its customers. Macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for Kaleyra's customers, including limited access to the credit markets, insolvency, or bankruptcy, and, as a result, could cause customers to delay payments to Kaleyra, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase Kaleyra's receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to Kaleyra. Timely collection of client balances also depends on Kaleyra's ability to complete its contractual commitments and bill and collect its contracted revenue. If Kaleyra is unable to meet its contractual requirements, it might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect its client balances. In addition, if Kaleyra experiences an increase in the time to bill and to collect for its services, Kaleyra's cash flows could be negatively impacted.

Unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. Furthermore, the most recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, including due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or one that could result from the recent military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including a reduced ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. Furthermore, supply chain issues that developed in 2021, and the nature, magnitude, and duration of hostilities stemming from Russia's military conflict with Ukraine, including the effects of sanctions and retaliatory cyber-attacks on the world economy and markets, could negatively impact our business. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.

Kaleyra's products and Platforms and its business are subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those regarding data protection and information security, and Kaleyra customers may be subject to regulations related to the handling and transfer of certain types of sensitive and confidential information. Any failure of Kaleyra's products to comply with or enable its customers and channel partners to comply with applicable laws and regulations could harm Kaleyra's business.

Kaleyra and its customers that use Kaleyra's products may be subject to data protection-related laws and regulations that impose obligations in connection with the collection, processing and use of personal data, financial data, health or other similar data. The U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use, security and storage of personally identifiable information of individuals. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and numerous state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the online collection, use and dissemination of data, and to the security measures applied to such data.

Similarly, many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the EU member states, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personally identifiable information obtained from individuals located in the EU or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction, which are often more restrictive than those in the U.S. laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of personally identifiable information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, telephone numbers, message addresses and, in some jurisdictions, IP addresses and other online identifiers.

For example, in April 2016 the EU adopted the GDPR, which took full effect on May 25, 2018. GDPR enhances data protection obligations for businesses and requires service providers (data processors) processing personal data on behalf of customers to cooperate with European data protection authorities, implement security measures and keep records of personal data processing activities. Noncompliance with the GDPR can trigger fines equal to or greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual revenues. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data

protection obligations, preparing to meet the requirements of GDPR has required significant time and resources, including a review ofKaleyra'stechnology and systems currently in use against the requirements of GDPR. There are also additional EU laws and regulations (and member states' implementations thereof) which govern the protection of consumers and of electronic communications. IfKaleyra'sefforts to comply with GDPR or other applicable EU laws and regulations are not successful,Kaleyramay be subject to penalties and fines that would adversely impactKaleyra'sbusiness and results of operations, andKaleyra'sability to conduct business in the EU could be significantly impaired.

Furthermore, outside of the EU, Kaleyra continues to see increased regulation of data privacy and security, including the adoption of more stringent subject matter specific state laws in the U.S. For example, on June 28, 2018, California enacted the CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase Kaleyra's compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent state privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase Kaleyra's potential liability and adversely affect its business.

Kaleyra continues to see jurisdictions imposing data localization laws, which require personal information, or certain subcategories of personal information to be stored in the jurisdiction of origin. These regulations may inhibit Kaleyra's ability to expand into those markets or prohibit Kaleyra from continuing to offer services in those markets without significant additional costs. The uncertainty and changes in the requirements of multiple jurisdictions may increase the cost of compliance, delay or reduce demand for Kaleyra's services, restrict Kaleyra's ability to offer services in certain locations, impact Kaleyra's customers' ability to deploy its solutions in certain jurisdictions, or subject Kaleyra to sanctions, by national data protection regulators.

Additionally, although Kaleyra endeavors to have its products and Platforms comply with applicable laws and regulations, these and other obligations may be modified, they may be interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and they may conflict with one another, other regulatory requirements, contractual commitments or Kaleyra's internal practices.

Kaleyra also may be bound by contractual obligations relating to its collection, use and disclosure of personal, financial and other data or may find it necessary or desirable to join industry or other self-regulatory bodies or other privacy- or data protection-related organizations that require compliance with their rules pertaining to privacy and data protection.

Kaleyra expects that there will continue to be new proposed laws, rules of self-regulatory bodies, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the U.S, the EU and other jurisdictions, and Kaleyra cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, rules, regulations and standards may have on Kaleyra's business. Moreover, existing U.S. federal and various state and foreign privacy- and data protection-related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws and regulations regarding privacy- and data protection-related matters. Because global laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy and data security have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that Kaleyra or its products or Platforms may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law, regulation and industry standard and compliance with such new laws or to changes to existing laws may impact Kaleyra's business and practices, requires Kaleyra to expend significant resources to adapt to these changes, or to stop offering Kaleyra's products in certain countries. These developments could harm Kaleyra's business.

Any failure or perceived failure by Kaleyra, its products or its Platforms to comply with new or existing U.S., EU or other foreign privacy or data security laws, regulations, policies, industry standards or legal obligations, or any security incident that results in the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of, personally identifiable information or other customer data may result in governmental investigations, inquiries, enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties, adverse publicity or potential loss of business.

Kaleyrais subject to privacy and data security obligations in theU.S. Any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or contractual obligations may harmKaleyra'sbusiness. The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), other federal agencies or state attorneys general could fine or subjectKaleyrato other adverse actions that may negatively impactKaleyra'sbusiness reputation. IfKaleyrais subject to an investigation or suffers a breach,Kaleyramay incur costs or be subject to forfeitures and penalties that could reduceKaleyra'sprofitability.

Kaleyra is subject to privacy and data security laws and regulations that impose obligations in connection with the collection, processing and use of personal data. Federal and state laws or proposed laws impose limits on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use, security and storage of personally identifiable information ("PII") of individuals. Kaleyra sees increased regulation of data privacy and security, including the adoption of more stringent subject matter specific state laws in the U.S. For example, in 2018, California enacted the CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020. As discussed in the above Risk Factor, the CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase Kaleyra's compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent state privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase Kaleyra's potential liability and adversely affect its business.

Kaleyra also may be bound by contractual obligations relating to Kaleyra's collection, use and disclosure of personal data or may find it necessary or desirable to join industry or other self-regulatory bodies or other privacy or security related organizations that require compliance with their rules pertaining to privacy and data protection.

Kaleyra is subject to individual or joint jurisdiction of the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission, and state attorneys general with respect to privacy and data security obligations. If Kaleyra was to suffer or if one of Kaleyra's customers were to suffer a breach, Kaleyra may be subject to the jurisdiction of a variety of federal agencies' jurisdictions as well as state attorneys general. Kaleyra may have to comply with a variety of data breach laws at the federal and state levels, comply with any resulting investigations, as well as offer mitigation to customers and potential end-users of certain customers to which Kaleyra provides services. Kaleyra could also be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties that may adversely impact Kaleyra's business.

Any failure or perceived failure by Kaleyra, its products or its Platforms to comply with new or existing U.S. privacy or data security laws, regulations, policies, industry standards or contractual or legal obligations, or any security incident that results in the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of, PII or other customer data may result in governmental investigations, inquiries, enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties, adverse publicity or potential loss of business.

The storage, processing and use of personal information and related data subjects Kaleyra to evolving governmental laws and regulation, commercial standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations related to consumer and data privacy, which may have a material impact on Kaleyra's costs, use of Kaleyra's services, or expose Kaleyra to increased liability.

U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, commercial obligations and industry standards, each provide for obligations and restrictions with respect to data privacy and security, as well as the collection, storage, retention, protection, use, processing, transmission, sharing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other customer data, including customer proprietary network information under applicable federal law. The evolving nature of these obligations and restrictions subjects Kaleyra to the risk of differing interpretations, inconsistency or conflicts among countries or rules, and creates uncertainty regarding their application to Kaleyra's business.

These obligations and restrictions may limit Kaleyra's ability to collect, store, process, use, transmit and share data with Kaleyra's customers, employees and third-party providers and to allow Kaleyra's customers to collect, store, retain, protect, use, process, transmit, share and disclose data with others through Kaleyra's services. Compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such obligations and restrictions could increase the cost of Kaleyra's operations and impact its ability to market its services through effective segmentation.

Failure to comply with obligations and restrictions related to applicable data protection laws, regulations, standards, and codes of conduct, as well asKaleyra'sown posted privacy policies and contractual commitments could subjectKaleyrato lawsuits, fines, criminal penalties, statutory damages, consent decrees, injunctions, adverse publicity, loss of user confidence inKaleyra'sservices, and loss of users, which could materially harmKaleyra'sbusiness. Because these obligations and restrictions have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible thatKaleyramay not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such obligation and restriction. Additionally, third-party contractors may have access to customer or employee data. If these or other third-party vendors violate obligations and restrictions related to applicable data protection laws orKaleyra'spolicies, such violations may also putKaleyra'scustomers' or employees' information at risk and could in turn harmKaleyra'sbusiness.

Changes in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect Kaleyra's business, investments and results of operations.

Kaleyra is subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, Kaleyra is required to comply with certain SEC, the NYSE, the NYSE American and other legal or regulatory requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws, regulations and rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on Kaleyra's business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on Kaleyra's business and results of operations.

Unfavorable conditions in Kaleyra's industry or the global economy or reductions in spending on information technology and communications could lower Kaleyra's revenue and harm its business.

Kaleyra's results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in Kaleyra's industry or the global economy on Kaleyra's customers. Kaleyra's results of operations depend in part on demand for information technology and cloud communications. In addition, Kaleyra's revenue is dependent on the usage of Kaleyra's products, which in turn is influenced by the scale of business that Kaleyra's customers are conducting. To the extent that weak economic conditions result in a reduced volume of business for, and communications by, Kaleyra's customers and prospective customers, demand for, and use of, Kaleyra's products may decline. Furthermore, weak economic conditions may make it more difficult to collect on outstanding trade receivables. Kaleyra has generated a portion of its revenue from small and medium-sized businesses, and Kaleyra expects this to continue to increase in the foreseeable future. Small and medium-sized business may be affected by economic downturns to a greater extent than enterprises, and typically have more limited financial resources, including capital borrowing capacity, than enterprises. If Kaleyra's customers reduce their use of Kaleyra's products, or prospective customers delay adoption or elect not to adopt Kaleyra products, as a result of a weak economy, this could lower Kaleyra's revenue and harm its business.

Kaleyra may require additional capital to support Kaleyra's business, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

Kaleyra intends to continue to make investments to support Kaleyra's business and may require additional funds. In particular, Kaleyra may seek additional funds to develop new products and enhance Kaleyra's Platforms and existing products, expand Kaleyra's operations, including Kaleyra's sales and marketing organizations and Kaleyra's presence outside of the U.S., improve Kaleyra's infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets. In addition, Kaleyra may use a portion of its cash to satisfy tax withholding and remittance obligations related to outstanding restricted stock units. Accordingly, Kaleyra may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If Kaleyra raises additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, in addition to the Financing, Kaleyra's stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities Kaleyra issues could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of Kaleyra's common stock. Any debt financing that Kaleyra may secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to Kaleyra's capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for Kaleyra to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. Kaleyra may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to Kaleyra, if at all. If Kaleyra is unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to Kaleyra when Kaleyra requires it, Kaleyra's ability to continue to support its business growth, scale its infrastructure, develop product

enhancements and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired and could harmKaleyra'sbusiness.

Kaleyra's business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as power disruptions, computer viruses, data security breaches or terrorism.

A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or flood, occurring at Kaleyra's headquarters, at one of Kaleyra's other facilities or where a business partner is located could adversely affect Kaleyra's business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, if a natural disaster or man-made problem were to affect Kaleyra's service providers, this could adversely affect the ability of Kaleyra's customers to use its products and Platforms. In addition, natural disasters and acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in Kaleyra's or its customers' businesses, national economies or the world economy as a whole. Kaleyra also rely on its network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications and internal technology systems for Kaleyra's engineering, sales and marketing, and operations activities. Although Kaleyra maintains incident management and disaster response plans, in the event of a major disruption caused by a natural disaster or man-made problem, Kaleyra may be unable to continue its operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in Kaleyra's development activities, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of data security and the loss of critical data.

In addition, computer malware, viruses and computer hacking, fraudulent use attempts and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in Kaleyra's industry, have occurred on Kaleyra's Platforms in the past and may occur on Kaleyra's Platforms in the future. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security, integrity and availability of Kaleyra's products and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of Kaleyra's users may harm Kaleyra's reputation and Kaleyra's ability to retain existing users and attract new users.

Kaleyra is unable to predict the extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact Kaleyra's business operations, financial performance, results of operations and stock price.

The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have, in the past and continue to, significantly curtail the movement of people, goods and services worldwide, including in most or all of the regions in which Kaleyra sells its products and services and conduct its business operations. Kaleyra also has its headquarters in Milan, Italy, which has been severely affected by the first wave of COVID-19 and the resulting government lockdowns to attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19. The fifth wave of COVID-19 triggered by the surge of the Omicron variant is currently affecting a large number of countries across the globe, and additional government restrictions are expected to reduce the resurgence in the pandemic infections. The magnitude and duration of the resulting decline in business activity cannot currently be estimated with any degree of certainty and threatens to (1) negatively impact the demand for its products and services, especially in those locations subject to "shelter in place" restrictions or similar government orders, (2) restrict its sales operations and marketing efforts, and (3) disrupt other important business activities in its various locations, some of which are also in areas affected by COVID-19. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of the Omicron variant, certain industry events that Kaleyra sponsors or at which Kaleyra presents or at which we present and certain customer events have been canceled, postponed or moved to virtual-only experiences; Kaleyra is encouraging all of its employees to work remotely; and Kaleyra may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee or industry events in the future. Additionally, Kaleyra may see its services carrying less revenue-generating traffic in areas subject to "shelter in place" restrictions or related government orders as the population of those areas refrain from traveling and normal commerce activities. Accordingly, Kaleyra expects the COVID-19 pandemic to potentially have a negative impact on its sales and its results of operations in those areas adversely affected by COVID-19, the size and duration of which Kaleyra are currently unable to predict. In addition, Kaleyra's implementation of business continuity plans in a fast-moving public health emergency could have an adverse effect on its internal controls (potentially giving rise to significant discrepancies or material weaknesses) and increase our vulnerability to information technology and other systems discrepancies. Furthermore, concerns over the economic impact of COVID-19 have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets which has and may continue to adversely impact Kaleyra's stock price and its ability to access capital.

IfKaleyra'sgoodwill or intangible assets become impaired,Kaleyramay be required to record a significant charge to earnings.

Kaleyra reviews its intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. As of December 31, 2021, Kaleyra carried a net $235.9 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net. An adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of Kaleyra's critical assumptions or estimates, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to Kaleyra's goodwill or intangible assets. Any such charges may adversely affect Kaleyra's results of operations.

Changes in the international and U.S. taxation business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially impact Kaleyra's business, results of operations and financial condition.

Changes to tax laws in jurisdictions where Kaleyra currently does business may be enacted in the future and could impact the tax treatment of Kaleyra's earnings. Due to the expansion of Kaleyra's business activities into new geographic regions, any changes in the taxation of such activities may increase Kaleyra's worldwide effective tax rate. An increase in overall tax rate could reduce Kaleyra's cash flow and lower Kaleyra's overall profitability.

Kaleyra's ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.

As of December 31, 2021, Kaleyra had federal, state and foreign net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards totaling $157.9 million, $177.8 million and $5.4 million, respectively. However, Kaleyra's ability to utilize these NOLs to offset taxable income may be limited in the future. A corporation that undergoes an "ownership change" is typically subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-ownership change NOLs to offset future taxable income. In general, under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% stockholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders' lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). Purchases or sales of Kaleyra's common stock in amounts greater than specified levels could create a limitation on Kaleyra's ability to utilize our NOLs for tax purposes in the future. Limitations imposed on Kaleyra's ability to utilize NOLs could cause U.S. federal and state income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect.

Furthermore, Kaleyra may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize Kaleyra's NOLs before they expire. In addition, NOLs incurred in one state generally are not available to offset income earned in a different state and there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited for state tax purposes, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.

Kaleyra's global operations and structure subject Kaleyra to potentially adverse tax consequences.

Kaleyra generally conducts Kaleyra global operations through subsidiaries and report Kaleyra's taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon Kaleyra's business operations in those jurisdictions. In particular, Kaleyra's intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. Also, Kaleyra's tax expense could be affected depending on the applicability of withholding and other taxes (including withholding and indirect taxes on software licenses and related intercompany transactions) under the tax laws of certain jurisdictions in which Kaleyra has business operations. The relevant revenue and taxing authorities may disagree with positions Kaleyra has taken generally, or Kaleyra's determinations as to the value of assets sold or acquired or income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and Kaleyra's position were not sustained, Kaleyra could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of Kaleyra's operations.

Certain government agencies in jurisdictions where Kaleyra and its affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational companies. In addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development is conducting a project focused on base erosion and profit shifting in international structures, which seeks to establish certain international standards for taxing the worldwide income of multinational companies. As a result of these developments, the tax laws of certain countries in which Kaleyra and its affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could increase

Kaleyra'sliabilities for taxes,interestand penalties, and therefore could harmKaleyra'sbusiness, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.

If Kaleyra is not able to maintain and enhance Kaleyra's brand and increase market awareness of Kaleyra and its services, then Kaleyra's business could be harmed.

Kaleyra believes that maintaining and enhancing Kaleyra's brand identity and increasing market awareness of Kaleyra and its services are critical to achieving widespread acceptance of Kaleyra and its Platforms, as well as to strengthen Kaleyra's relationships with its existing customers and to Kaleyra's ability to attract new customers. The successful promotion of Kaleyra's brand will depend largely on Kaleyra's continued marketing efforts, Kaleyra's ability to continue to offer high quality services and Kaleyra's ability to successfully differentiate Kaleyra's services from competing products and services. Kaleyra's brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue. In addition, independent industry analysts often provide reviews of Kaleyra's services and competing products and services, which may significantly influence the perception of Kaleyra's services in the marketplace. If these reviews are negative or not as strong as reviews of Kaleyra's competitors' services, then Kaleyra's brand may be harmed.

From time to time, Kaleyra's customers have complained about Kaleyra's services. If Kaleyra does not handle customer complaints effectively, then Kaleyra's brand and reputation may suffer, Kaleyra's customers may lose confidence in Kaleyra and they may reduce or cease their use of Kaleyra's services. Kaleyra's success depends, in part, on Kaleyra's ability to generate positive customer feedback. Complaints or negative publicity about Kaleyra, its services or Platforms could harm Kaleyra's ability to attract and retain customers.

The promotion of Kaleyra's brand also requires Kaleyra to make substantial expenditures, and Kaleyra anticipates that these expenditures will increase as Kaleyra's market becomes more competitive and as Kaleyra expands into new markets. To the extent that these activities increase revenue, this revenue still may not be enough to offset the increased expenses Kaleyra incurs. If Kaleyra does not successfully maintain and enhance its brand, then Kaleyra's business may not grow, Kaleyra may see its pricing power reduced relative to competitors and Kaleyra may lose customers, all of which could lower Kaleyra's revenue and harm its business.

Any failure to deliver and maintain high-quality customer support may adversely affect Kaleyra's relationships with its customers and prospective customers and could adversely affect Kaleyra's reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.

Many of Kaleyra's customers depend on Kaleyra's customer support team to assist them in deploying or using Kaleyra's services effectively, to help them resolve post-deployment issues quickly and to provide ongoing support. If Kaleyra does not devote sufficient resources or are otherwise unsuccessful in assisting Kaleyra's customers effectively, it could adversely affect Kaleyra's ability to retain existing customers and could prevent prospective customers from adopting Kaleyra's services. Kaleyra may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in demand for customer support. Kaleyra also may be unable to modify the nature, scope and delivery of its customer support to compete with changes in the support services provided by Kaleyra's competitors. Increased demand for customer support, without corresponding revenue, could increase Kaleyra's costs and harm its business and operations. Kaleyra's sales are highly dependent on Kaleyra's business reputation. Any failure to deliver and maintain high-quality customer support, or a market perception that Kaleyra does not maintain high-quality customer support, could harm Kaleyra's reputation and business.

Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose Kaleyra to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.

Kaleyra's agreements with customers and other third parties typically include indemnification or other provisions under which Kaleyra agrees to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, damages caused by Kaleyra to property or persons or other liabilities relating to or arising from Kaleyra's services or Platforms or other acts or omissions. The term of these contractual provisions often survives termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large indemnity payments or damage claims from a contractual breach could harm Kaleyra's business. Although Kaleyra normally contractually limit its liability with respect to such obligations, Kaleyra may still incur substantial liability related to

them. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could harmKaleyra'srelationship with that customer and other current and prospective customers and reduce demand for its services.

Kaleyra is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business, and uninsured judgments or a rise in insurance premiums may adversely affect Kaleyra's results of operations.

In the ordinary course of business, Kaleyra is subject to various claims and litigation. Any such claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management's attention and resources. In accordance with customary practice, Kaleyra maintains insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims. Kaleyra may elect not to obtain insurance if Kaleyra believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. The levels of insurance Kaleyra maintains may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. Further, Kaleyra may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels or at all. If any significant judgment, claim (or a series of claims) or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact on Kaleyra's business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance as to the actual amount of these liabilities or the timing thereof. Kaleyra cannot be certain that the outcome of current or future litigation will not harm its business and results of operations.

Defects or errors in Kaleyra's services could diminish demand for Kaleyra's services, harm Kaleyra's business and subject Kaleyra to liability.

Kaleyra's customers use its services for important aspects of their businesses, and any errors, defects or disruptions to Kaleyra's services and any other performance problems with Kaleyra's services could damage its customers' businesses and, in turn, hurt Kaleyra's brand and reputation. Kaleyra provides regular updates to Kaleyra's services, which have in the past contained, and may in the future contain, undetected errors, failures, vulnerabilities and bugs when first introduced or released. Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in Kaleyra's services could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance of Kaleyra's Platforms, loss of competitive position, lower customer retention or claims by customers for losses sustained by them. In such an event, Kaleyra may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem. In addition, Kaleyra may not carry insurance sufficient to compensate Kaleyra for any losses that may result from claims arising from defects or disruptions in Kaleyra's services. As a result, Kaleyra's brand and reputation could be harmed.

If Kaleyra does not file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, holders will only be able to exercise such warrants on a "cashless basis."

If Kaleyra does not maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants at the time that holders wish to exercise such warrants, they will only be able to exercise them on a "cashless basis" provided that an exemption from registration is available. As a result, the number of shares of common stock that holders will receive upon exercise of the warrants will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised its warrant for cash. Further, if an exemption from registration is not available, holders would not be able to exercise on a cashless basis and would only be able to exercise their warrants for cash if a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is available. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, Kaleyra has agreed to use its best efforts to meet these conditions and to maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants. However, Kaleyra cannot make any assurances that it will be able to do so. If Kaleyra is unable to do so, the potential "upside" of the holder's investment in Kaleyra may be reduced or the warrants may expire worthless.

There is no guarantee that the warrants will be in the money, and they may expire worthless and the terms of warrants may be amended.

The exercise price for the warrants is $11.50 per share of common stock. There is no guarantee that the public warrants will continue to be in the money prior to their expiration, and as such, the warrants may expire worthless.

In addition, the warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants to make any other change. Accordingly,Kaleyramay amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. AlthoughKaleyra'sability to amend the terms of the warrants with the consent of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, shorten the exerciseperiodor decrease the number of shares and their respective affiliates and associates have of common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.

If Kaleyra fails to introduce or acquire new products or services that achieve broad market acceptance on a timely basis, or if its products or services are not adopted as expected, Kaleyra will not be able to compete effectively.

Kaleyra operates in a highly competitive, quickly changing environment, and Kaleyra's future success depends on its ability to develop or acquire, and introduce new products and services that achieve broad market acceptance. Kaleyra's ability to successfully introduce and market new products is unproven. Because Kaleyra has a limited operating history and the market for its products, including newly acquired or developed products, is rapidly evolving, it is difficult to predict Kaleyra's operating results, particularly with respect to any new products that it may introduce. Kaleyra's future success will depend in large part upon its ability to identify demand trends in the market in which it will operate and quickly develop or acquire, and design, manufacture and sell, products and services that satisfy these demands in a cost-effective manner.

In order to differentiate Kaleyra's products and services from competitors' products, Kaleyra will need to increase focus and capital investment in research and development, including software development. If any products currently sold by, and services offered by, Kaleyra do not continue, or if Kaleyra's new products or services fail to achieve widespread market acceptance, or if Kaleyra is unsuccessful in capitalizing on opportunities in the market in which Kaleyra operates, our future growth may be slowed and its business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Successfully predicting demand trends is difficult, and it is very difficult to predict the effect that introducing a new product or service will have on existing product or service sales. It is possible that Kaleyra may not be successful with its new products and services, and as a result Kaleyra's future growth may be slowed and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Also, Kaleyra may not be able to respond effectively to new product or service announcements by competitors by quickly introducing competitive products and services.

In addition, Kaleyra may acquire companies and technologies in the future. In these circumstances, Kaleyra may not be able to successfully manage integration of the new product and service lines with our existing suite of products and services. If Kaleyra is unable to effectively and successfully further develop these new product and service lines, Kaleyra may not be able to increase or maintain sales (as compared to sales of Kaleyra on a standalone basis), and our gross margin (as compared to sales of Kaleyra on a standalone basis) may be adversely affected.

Furthermore, the success of Kaleyra's new products will depend on several factors, including, but not limited to, market demand costs, timely completion and introduction of these products, prompt resolution of any defects or bugs in these products, Kaleyra's ability to support these products, differentiation of new products from those of the Kaleyra's competitors, market acceptance of these products, delays and quality issues in releasing new products and services. The occurrence of one or more of the foregoing factors may result in lower quarterly revenue than expected, and Kaleyra may in the future experience product or service introductions that fall short of its projected rates of market adoption.

If Kaleyra's products fail to achieve and sustain sufficient market acceptance, Kaleyra's revenue will be adversely affected.

Kaleyra's success will depend on its ability to develop and market products that are recognized and accepted as reliable, enabling and cost-effective. Some potential customers of Kaleyra may already use products similar to what Kaleyra currently offers and similar to what Kaleyra may offer in the future and may be reluctant to replace

those products with whatKaleyracurrently offers or whichKaleyramay offer in the future. Market acceptance ofKaleyra'sproducts and technology will depend on many factors, includingKaleyra'sability to convince potential customers thatKaleyra'sproducts and technology are an attractive alternative to existing products and technology. Prior to adoptingKaleyra'sproducts and technology, some potential customers may need to devote time and effort to testing and validatingKaleyra'ssystems. Any failure ofKaleyra'ssystems to meet these customer benchmarks could result in potential customers choosing to retain their existing systems or to purchase systems other thanKaleyra's.

If Kaleyra's performance does not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market price of its securities may decline.

If Kaleyra's performance does not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of its securities may decline. In addition, fluctuations in the price of Kaleyra's securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. The trading price of Kaleyra's securities could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond Kaleyra's control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in Kaleyra's securities and these securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of Kaleyra's securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.

Factors affecting the trading price of Kaleyra's securities may include:

• actual or anticipated fluctuations in Kaleyra's quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to Kaleyra;

• changes in the market's expectations about Kaleyra's operating results;

• success of competitors;

• Kaleyra's operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;

• changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning Kaleyra or the market in general;

• operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to Kaleyra's;

• Kaleyra's ability to market new and enhanced services and products on a timely basis;

• changes in laws and regulations affecting Kaleyra's business;

• commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving Kaleyra;

• changes in Kaleyra's capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;

• the volume of shares of Kaleyra's securities available for public sale;

• any major change in the Board of Directors (the "Board") or management;

• sales of substantial amounts ofcommon stockby Kaleyra's directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and

• general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.

Broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of Kaleyra's securities irrespective of its operating performance. The stock market in general and the NYSE have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of Kaleyra's securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to Kaleyracould depress its stock price regardless of its business, prospects,

financialconditionor results of operations. A decline in the market price ofKaleyra'ssecurities also could adversely affect its ability to issue additional securities and its ability to obtain additional financing in the future.

If securities or industry analysts cease publishing research or reports about Kaleyra, its business, or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding its securities adversely, the price and trading volume of its securities could decline.

The trading market for Kaleyra's securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about Kaleyra, its business, its market, or its competitors. If any of the analysts who currently or in the future may cover Kaleyra, change their recommendation regarding its stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about Kaleyra's competitors, the price of its securities would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover Kaleyrawere to cease coverage of Kaleyra or fail to regularly publish reports on it, Kaleyra could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause its stock price or trading volume to decline.

There may be a limited public market for the shares of common stock of Kaleyra, and the ability of the stockholders of Kaleyra to dispose of their common stock may be limited.

Kaleyra's common stock is traded on the NYSE. Kaleyra cannot foresee the degree of liquidity that will be associated with its common stock. A holder of the common stock may not be able to liquidate his, her or its investment in a short time period or at the market prices that currently exist at the time the holder decides to sell. The market price for the common stock may fluctuate in the future, and such volatility may bear no relation to Kaleyra's performance.

A market for Kaleyra's securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of its securities.

The price of Kaleyra's securities may fluctuate significantly due to the market's reaction to Kaleyra and general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for Kaleyra's securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the price of Kaleyra's securities can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, Kaleyra's general business condition and the release of its financial reports. Additionally, if Kaleyra's securities become delisted from the NYSE for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of Kaleyra's securities may be more limited than if its securities were quoted or listed on the NYSE or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained.

There can be no assurance that Kaleyra will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of the NYSE and the NYSE American.

Kaleyra's common stock is currently listed on the NYSE and its warrants on the NYSE American. If the NYSE or NYSE American delists Kaleyra's securities from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, Kaleyra and its stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:

• a limited availability of market quotations for Kaleyra's securities;

• a determination that thecommon stockis a "penny stock" which will require brokers trading in itscommon stockto adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for thecommon stock;

• a limited amount of analyst coverage; and

• a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.

Kaleyra qualifies as an emerging growth company, and Kaleyra's decision to comply with reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.

Kaleyra is an "emerging growth company," and, for as long as Kaleyra continues to be an emerging growth company, Kaleyra currently intends to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to "emerging growth companies," including, but not limited to, not being required to have its independent registered public accounting firm audit Kaleyra's internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its registration statements, periodic reports and proxy statements (including the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part) and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Kaleyra will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the IPO; (ii) the first fiscal year after its annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more; (iii) the date on which Kaleyra has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (iv) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of its common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.

Kaleyra cannot predict whether investors will find its common stock less attractive if Kaleyra chooses to rely on these exemptions while Kaleyra is an emerging growth company. If some investors find its common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for its common stock and the price of its common stock may be more volatile.

Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Kaleyra has availed itself of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, Kaleyra may not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2. Properties.

Kaleyra leases 18 properties, with its headquarters in Milan, Italy. Kaleyra maintains a global footprint with additional leased facilities located in Bengaluru, India; Chennai, India; Delhi, India; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Kochi, India; Kolkata, India; London, United Kingdom; Los Angeles, California; Mexico City, Mexico; Mumbai, India; Munich, Germany; New York, New York, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and Vienna, Virginia. Kaleyra believes that its current facilities are adequate to meet its ongoing needs and that, if it requires adjusted or additional space, it will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms, or further consolidate facilities. Going forward, Kaleyra will continue to assess its facilities requirements and make appropriate adjustments as needed and dictated by the business.

Kaleyra operates 32 data centers, including cloud platforms operated by Amazon Web Services, and Kaleyra maintains private clouds on behalf of its customers. The Kaleyra private cloud devices are custom-built hardware running Kaleyra's Platforms and, thus, can be deployed virtually anywhere. Kaleyra currently runs these private cloud devices out of its headquarters in Milan, Italy.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

From time to time, Kaleyra may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. Kaleyra is not currently involved in any material legal proceedings as a defendant.

On October 17, 2018, Kaleyra filed a claim against Vodafone Italia S.p.A. ("Vodafone") before the Court of Milan seeking compensation in the amount of €6.1 million ($6.9 million at the December 31, 2021 exchange rate) for all the damages suffered as a consequence of the illicit and anticompetitive conduct of Vodafone, as previously determined by the Italian Antitrust Authority (namely, Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato or AGCM)

in their decisions issued on December 13, 2017; Vodafone has appealed that sanctioning resolution before the Italian Regional Administrative Court.

The deadline for filing a counterclaim by Vodafone has passed and according to Italian Law, Vodafone is no longer entitled to file a counterclaim against Kaleyra in these proceedings. Both Kaleyra and Vodafone have filed their final pleadings on October 1, 2019 and October 21, 2019.

The Court of Milan has decided to suspend the procedure, through order no. 1570 on May 18, 2020. The decision of the Court of Milan is based on procedural reasons only (concerning the unprecedented definition of the relationship between administrative and civil proceedings in the case at hand) and does not analyze or take into any consideration the merits of the action brought by Kaleyra. The procedural suspension ordered by the Court of Milan shall last until the appeal brought by Vodafone before the Italian Regional Administrative Court against the decision of the Italian Antitrust Authority is concluded with a definitive judgment. Accordingly, following the order of suspension issued by the Civil Court of Milan, on August 10, 2020, Kaleyra filed a request to speed up the scheduling of the hearing in relation to the pending appeal before the Italian Regional Administrative Court brought by Vodafone Italia. The Court upheld Kaleyra's request and the hearing took place on February 24, 2021. Accordingly, the parties submitted their final defenses. On September 15, 2021, the Administrative Court issued its first instance decision that upheld Vodafone's appeal and annulled the sanctioning resolution issued by the Italian Competition Authority (the "ICA") (decision no. 9803/2021). On December 10, 2021, the ICA filed its appeal to the second instance Court (Council of State) against the Administrative Court first instance decision no. 9803/2021 asking to overrule it. Both Vodafone and Kaleyra submitted their appearances in the judicial proceeding, but no hearing has been scheduled yet by the Council of State. Until a final decision is reached by the Council of State there will be no effect on the civil proceeding that will therefore remain suspended.

The outcome of such action cannot be determined at this time. Therefore, no recognition of these actions has been made in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

On April 16, 2019, Kaleyra filed a claim against Telecom Italia S.p.A. ("Telecom") and Telecom Italia Sparkle S.p.A. ("Sparkle", jointly with Telecom "Defendants") before the Court of Milan seeking compensation in the amount of €8.3 million ($10.2 million at the December 31, 2020 exchange rate) for damages suffered after the illicit conduct of both counterparts, determined by the Italian Antitrust Authority in the decision issued on December 13, 2017.

At the first hearing before the Court of Milan held for the appearance of the parties on December 11, 2019, the judge reserved the decision on the possible suspension of the case in consideration of the appeal brought by Telecom Italia S.p.A and Telecom Italia Sparkle S.p.A. against the Italian Antitrust Authority's decision of December 13, 2017 before the Regional Administrative Court, which is currently pending.

By order issued on December 14, 2019, the judge released his reserve and referred the issue concerning the relation between the assessment of the pending administrative case and the one to be carried out in the civil case to a panel composed of three judges. The case was therefore adjourned for a hearing on April 29, 2020 where the parties had to file their final pleadings.

On April 9, 2020, following the measures taken by the Italian legislator for the Covid-19 pandemic, the above-mentioned hearing was postponed to and then held on October 7, 2020. At the hearing of October 7, 2020, the parties exposed their closing arguments and the decision on the preliminary question as to the suspension of the civil proceedings has been reserved to a panel composed of three judges. The parties also submitted written observations concerning the preliminary question.

On January 7, 2021, the Court issued an order by which the civil proceedings have been suspended until the decision in the pending administrative case - which was deemed to be prejudicial to the civil one - becomes final (i.e., it is no longer subject to appeal). The order was communicated to the parties via certified electronic mail on January 11, 2021.

In light of the average duration of cases before the Italian Administrative Courts and the Defendants' interest in both having the Italian Competition Authority's decision annulled and procrastinating the administrative case (on which the civil proceedings now depend pursuant to the above-mentioned order) for dilatory purposes, the civil case is unlikely to proceed in the short term. In order to speed up the administrative proceedings (and thus the civil case), on February 9, 2021, Kaleyra filed an application with the Administrative Court of Latium requesting that the hearing on the merits of the case be held as soon as possible ("istanza di prelievo"). On September 23, 2021, the

Defendants filed with the Administrative Court of Latium their "istanzadiprelievo" aimed at requesting a prompt schedule of the hearing on the merits of the case. The request is motivated taking into consideration, inter alia, the decision, dated September 15, 2021, by which - in a parallel case - the same Administrative Court annulled the decision by which the Italian Competition Authority (decision no. 9803/2021) ascertained that Vodafone Italia S.p.A. committed an abuse of a dominant position in violation of art. 102 TFEU for margin squeeze (i.e., for behaviors similar to those attributed to the Defendants in the decision). The hearing has been scheduled on March 23, 2022.

Also, in light of the above, the outcome of Kaleyra's civil action nor its duration is predictable at this time.

The outcome of such civil action cannot be determined at this time. Therefore, no recognition of these actions has been made in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

In addition to the above, Kaleyra has appealed the resolutions issued by the Italian Communications Authority (namely, Autorità per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni or AGCom) concerning their request for the annual fee to AGCom for years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

The first instance proceeding against AGCom's resolutions for the 2016 contribution was successful for Kaleyra and the Italian Regional Administrative Court annulled the resolutions Kaleyra had appealed (judgement no. 2161/2019). However, AGCom filed its second instance appeal before the Council of State seeking the overruling of the Court's decision. The appeal has been regularly discussed at the hearing of September 17, 2020 and the Council of State issued its decision number 6175/2020 on October 13, 2020, overruling in part the Regional Court decision. AGCom will have to recalculate the annual contribution due from Kaleyra for year 2016. However, the annual contribution is not considered material to Kaleyra's consolidated financial statements.

For the annual contribution to AGCom relating the years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 the legal proceedings are currently pending before the Italian Regional Administrative Court and no hearing has been scheduled yet. However, the European Court of Justice ("ECJ") has already delivered its decision on the request for a preliminary ruling submitted by the Council of State on the relevant EU law (case C-399/18). Such decision was delivered on April 29, 2020, in accordance with a simplified procedure due to the previous issuance by the ECJ of a number of judgements on the matter.

Finally, Kaleyra took part in two appeals brought before the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio (TAR Lazio) by, respectively, an Association of Content Service Providers ("CSP") for Value Added Services on mobile network ("VAS"), and one singular CSP, against a specific resolution of the Italian Communications Authority regarding the rules for applying a barring mechanism on the SIM of the final users of VAS (resolution no. 10/21/CONS). Kaleyra filed its interventions in both the judicial proceedings to support the measures issued by AGCom.

Specifically, following the hearing before TAR Lazio that took place on March 17, 2021, the Court has issued two orders (no. 1748 and no. 1751, dated March 18, 2021) that rejected the precautionary measures requested by both the plaintiffs, upholding the position represented by Kaleyra to support the legitimacy of the abovementioned resolution. Following the definition of the precautionary phase, both appeals are likely to be discussed on the merits in the next months. As of today, TAR Lazio has not scheduled any further hearing, hence there is no imminent deadline with regard to those judicial proceedings. For the sake of completeness, the final judgments of TAR Lazio on the two appeals above shall not result in any economic direct impact on Kaleyra.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data.

The following selected financial data are qualified in their entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information contained in the consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and the information set forth in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

You should read the following management's discussion and analysis in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of Kaleyra as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and for the years there ended and the related notes. The discussion below includes forward-looking statements about Kaleyra's business, operations and industry that are based on current expectations that are subject to uncertainties and unknown or changed circumstances. Kaleyra's actual results may differ materially from these expectations as a result of many factors, including those risks and uncertainties described in the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements."

OVERVIEW

Kaleyra is a result of the expansion of the former Ubiquity, which was founded in Milan, Italy in 1999. Ubiquity secured a leading market position in mobile messaging on behalf of the Italian financial services industry and then sought to expand its products and geographic offerings. Ubiquity acquired Solutions Infini of Bangalore, India in 2017 and Buc Mobile of Vienna, Virginia in 2018. It was rebranded as Kaleyra S.p.A. in February 2018. Following the integration of the acquired entities, the combined company is collectively engaged in the operation of the Platforms on behalf of Kaleyra's customers.

On February 22, 2019, the Company (f/k/a GigCapital, Inc.) entered into a stock purchase agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement") by and among the Company, Kaleyra S.p.A., Shareholder Representative Services LLC, as representative for the holders of the ordinary shares of Kaleyra S.p.A. immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination, and all of the stockholders of all of the Kaleyra S.p.A. stock (collectively, such Kaleyra S.p.A. stockholders, the "Sellers"), for the purpose of the Company acquiring all of the shares of Kaleyra S.p.A.. GigCapital Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on October 9, 2017 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.

As a result of the Business Combination, which closed on November 25, 2019, the Company (headquartered in Milan, Italy) became a multi-channel integrated communication services provider on a global scale. Kaleyra operates in the Communications Platform as a Service ("CPaaS") market with operations in Italy, India, Dubai and the United States. In connection with the closing, the Company changed its name from GigCapital, Inc. to Kaleyra, Inc..

Kaleyra provides mobile communication services to financial institutions, e-commerce players, OTTs, software companies, logistic enablers, healthcare providers, retailers, and other large organizations worldwide. Through its proprietary cloud communications platforms (collectively as the "Platforms"), Kaleyra manages multi-channel integrated communication services on a global scale, consisting of messaging, rich messaging and instant messaging (including WhatsApp®), video, push notifications, e-mail, programmable voice services, Interactive Voice Response ("IVR") configurations, and chatbots.

On July 29, 2020, Kaleyra registered a German branch of Kaleyra S.p.A. with the German Chamber Tax Authority of Commerce. Kaleyra established its branch in Germany, by far the most important country in Europe to Kaleyra after Italy, to expand Kaleyra's footprint in Central Europe and the Nordic countries and allow it to leverage Kaleyra's trusted business solutions for customers in additional jurisdictions.

Kaleyra's subsidiary, Campaign Registry Inc., a systems initiative to reduce spam by collecting robotically driven campaign information and processing and sharing that information with mobile operators and the messaging ecosystem, began its soft launch during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, ending up with its first revenue contracts in the second half of the year.

On February 18, 2021, Kaleyra entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Vivial, Inc. ("Vivial") for the acquisition of the business known as mGage ("mGage"), a leading global mobile messaging provider (the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the "Merger").

On June 1, 2021, Kaleyra completed its acquisition of mGage for a total purchase price of $218.0 million. The Merger consideration consisted of both cash consideration and common stock consideration. On August 30, 2021, the Company prepared and delivered to the Stockholder Representative a written statement (the "Post-Closing Statement") setting forth the calculation of closing cash and closing net working capital which ultimately resulted in

the final Merger consideration to be equal to $217.0 million pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The cash consideration amounted to $199.2 million of which $198.6 million was paid on June 1,2021and the remaining amount was settled during the period ended September 30, 2021, including a working capital adjustment of $997,000. The common stock consideration was paid with the issuance to Vivial's former equity holders of a total of 1,600,000 shares ofKaleyracommon stock at the $11.77 per share closing price ofKaleyracommon stock on the date of issuance, equal to $18.8 million. In support of the consummation of the Merger, on February 18, 2021,Kaleyraentered into subscription agreements (the "PIPE Subscription Agreements"), with certain institutional investors (the "PIPE Investors"), pursuant to which, among other things,Kaleyraagreed to issue and sell, in private placements to close immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, an aggregate of 8,400,000 shares ofKaleyracommon stock to the PIPE Investors at $12.50 per share.Kaleyraalso entered into convertible note subscription agreements (the "Convertible Note Subscription Agreements") with certain institutional investors (the "Convertible Note Investors"), pursuant to whichKaleyraagreed to issue and sell, in private placements to close immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, $200 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible notes (the "Merger Convertible Notes").

On July 1, 2021, Kaleyra completed a company reorganization of the acquired business of mGage through the initial dissolution of the Delaware single member LLCs of Vivial Holdings, LLC, Vivial Networks, LLC, and the following merger of mGage, LLC into the surviving holding company, Vivial Inc., which subsequently changed its name into Kaleyra US Inc., as a result of the reorganization. As a result of the merger, Kaleyra US Inc. became the holding company of the following entities: one hundred percent (100%) direct ownership of mGage Europe Ltd. (UK) and one hundred percent (100%) direct ownership of mGage SA de SV (Mexico).

On July 8, 2021, Kaleyra completed the acquisition of Bandyer Srl ("Bandyer") for cash consideration of $15.4 million. Bandyer offers cloud-based audio/video communications services via Web Real Time Communication ("WebRTC") technology to financial institutions, retail companies, utilities, industries, insurance companies, human resources, and digital healthcare organizations. Bandyer provides customers with programmable audio/video APIs and Software Development Kits ("SDKs") based on WebRTC technology for a variety of use cases, including Augmented Reality ("AR") applications for smart glasses.

Effective August 31, 2021, the common stock of the Company ceased trading on the NYSE American and commenced trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "KLR." Kaleyra's warrants continue to trade on the NYSE American under the symbol "KLR WS".

On October 11, 2021, Kaleyra Africa Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kaleyra Inc., was incorporated under the law of South Africa with the registered office in Waterfall City, Gauteng. This newly established subsidiary is part of Kaleyra's broader strategic plan of expanding into emerging markets whereby South Africa will serve as Kaleyra's hub to enter the entire African market.

On November 15, 2021, pursuant to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, Kaleyra Dominicana, S.R.L., ninety-nine percent (99%) direct ownership of Kaleyra US Inc. and one percent (1%) direct ownership of Kaleyra Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the Dominican Republic with the registered office in Santo Domingo. This newly established subsidiary is aimed to provide the Kaleyra group with back-office technology support and engage in product development and innovation.

The demand for cloud communications is increasingly driven by the growing, and often mandated, need for enterprises to undertake a digital transformation that includes omnichannel, mobile-first and interactive customer communications. Mobile network operators typically are the gateway to reach end-user consumers' mobile devices. Kaleyra enables its customers and business partners to connect enterprise software and applications to mobile network operators by providing carefully documented Application Programming Interfaces ("APIs"). In addition, Kaleyra also offer an extensive set of no-coding cloud-based visual interfaces to programme communications to the customers across multiple channels. Kaleyra's Platforms couple the possibility of sending communications to end-user customers to a "Software as a Service" or SaaS business model, creating what is generally referred to as a "Communications Platform as a Service", or simply CPaaS.

Kaleyra's vision is to be the CPaaS provider which best aligns with its customers' and business partners' communication requirements, or the most trusted provider, in the world. This requires a combination of security, compliance and integration capabilities that protects the integrity and privacy of Kaleyra's customers' transactions and includes other key features such as ease of provisioning, reliable network connectivity, high availability for scaling, redundancy, embedded regulatory compliance, configurable monitoring and reporting. Kaleyra believes the

percentage ofCPaaScustomers that will require security, compliance and integration will represent an increasingly larger portion of the market, particularly with the expected exponential growth of transactional-by-nature cloud communications applications, better enablingKaleyrato set itself apart from its competition.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, Kaleyra processed nearly 44 billion billable messages and 6 billion voice calls. Kaleyra organizes its efforts in four regions, Americas, Europe, APAC and MEA. Its workforce is spread across the globe either in full-remote or office-based mode, in one of its principal offices based in New York, New York, Vienna, Virginia, Los Angeles, California, Atlanta, Georgia, Milan, Italy, Munich, Germany, London, United Kingdom, and Bangalore, India. Kaleyra's has over 560 employees following the closing of the Merger.

Kaleyra has more than 3,800 customers and business partners worldwide across industry verticals such as financial institutions, e-commerce players, OTTs, software companies, logistic enablers, healthcare providers, retailers, and other large organizations worldwide. In 2021 and 2020, there was no customer which individually accounted for more than 10% of Kaleyra's consolidated total revenues.

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, 71% of revenues came from customers which have been on the Platforms for at least one year. Although Kaleyra continues to expand by introducing new customers to the Platforms, the breadth and stability of its existing customers provide it with a solid base of revenue upon which it can continue to innovate and make investment to strengthen its product portfolio, expand its global presence, and in particular into the North America markets following the recent acquisition of mGage, recruit world-class talent and target accretive acquisitions to capitalize on its growing market penetration opportunities and value creation.

Kaleyra's customers are enterprises which use digital mobile communications in the conduct of their business. Kaleyra provides multiple levels of global customer support 24x7, SLAs and network reliability to meet the expectations and requirements of its customers. Customers and business partners which use the Platforms value the Platforms' network reliability, and Kaleyra's responsive customer support, competitive pricing, and collaborative approach. In particular, Kaleyra has been listed by Gartner (Gartner, Market Guide for Communications Platform as a Service, Worldwide, Daniel O'Connell, Lisa Under-Farboud, October 2021) as a co-creator, in other words, a CPaaS focused on a consultative business model that charges customers charge through a combination of CPaaS usage, platform fee and professional service fees. Also, Kaleyra was given the Gold award for "CPaaS Provider of the Year" by Juniper Research in February 2022.

Kaleyra services a broad base of customers and business partners throughout the world operating in diverse sectors and regions. Kaleyra's key customers are large Business to Consumer ("B2C") and Business to Business to Consumer ("B2B2C") enterprises which use digital and mobile communications in the conduct of their business. Kaleyra has a concentration of business within the financial services industry that serves its major European banking end-user customers. With each relationship, Kaleyra is the link between the financial institutions and their end-user customers. In linking these two parties, Kaleyra's Platforms leverage the telecommunications provider to transmit critical message data to these end-user customers.

For the years 2021 and 2020, the majority of Kaleyra's revenue was derived from its multi-channel CPaaS product offering market. Please see the section below titled "Factors Affecting Comparability of Results" for further information regarding the effects of acquisitions.

Kaleyra's revenue is primarily driven by the number of messages delivered and voice calls connected to its customers and business partners. Kaleyra's fees vary depending on the contract. In 2021, the number of messages delivered to customers increased by 73%, while the number of voice calls connected to customers increased by 57%, compared to the prior year. The increase in the number of messages delivered to customers is mainly driven by the volume additions following the business combination with mGage. The increase in voice calls connected to its customers was mainly the result of higher voice activities in India, as compared to prior year. The number of messages delivered and voice calls connected to customers is still affected by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the most recent surge in the Omicron variant strain, which resulted in significant fluctuations in Kaleyra's services carrying less revenue-generating traffic in areas subject to "shelter in place" restrictions or related government orders.

Volume increase has been driven by the increased number of digital payments transactions made by the end-user customers (such as credit card transactions and other digital payments), by the increasing usage of mobile banking features and by the increasing penetration rate of digital payments in the underlying payments markets. Kaleyra is exposed to fluctuations of the currencies in which its transactions are denominated. Specifically, a

material portion ofKaleyra'srevenues and purchases are denominated in Euro,Indian Rupees and United Arab Emirates Dirham.

FACTORS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY OF RESULTS

The business combination with mGage

On June 1, 2021, Kaleyra completed its Merger with Vivial, and the resulting acquisition of the business owned by Vivial known as mGage, a leading global mobile messaging provider. The acquisition of mGage, subsequently renamed Kaleyra US Inc. following its reorganization, provided an opportunity for Kaleyra to expand its network operator connections and become one of only four companies providing direct connectivity to all tier-1 US carriers.

The purchase consideration amounting to $217.0 million consisted of cash consideration and common stock consideration. Cash consideration amounted to $199.2 million of which $198.6 million was paid on June 1, 2021 and the remaining amount was settled during the period ended September 30, 2021, including a working capital adjustment of $997,000. The common stock consideration was paid with the issuance to Vivial's former equity holders of a total of 1,600,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock. The resulting amount, which was based upon the $11.77 per share closing price of Kaleyra common stock as of June 1, 2021, was equal to $18.8 million and has been recognized as part of the consideration transferred.

Kaleyra US Inc. contributed $82.0 million to the consolidated total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2021 after it was consolidated and represented 30.6% of the consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.

In 2021, the Company incurred costs related to the acquisition of mGage of $5.5 million that were expensed in General and Administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.

The business combination with Bandyer

On July 8, 2021, the Company announced the acquisition of Bandyer for cash consideration of $15.4 million. Bandyer offers cloud-based audio/video communications services via WebRTC technology to financial institutions, retail companies, utilities, industries, insurance, human resources and digital healthcare organizations. Bandyer provides customers with programmable audio/video APIs and SDKs based on WebRTC technology for a variety of use cases, including Augmented Reality ("AR") applications for smart glasses.The acquisition of Bandyer adds video capabilities to Kaleyra's already wide offering of communication channels. With the addition of Bandyer's video offering, Kaleyra's offerings become a complete suite of tools for omnichannel customer engagement designed for cross-channel customer experiences.

Bandyer contributed $1.0 million to the consolidated total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2021 after it was consolidated and represented 0.4% of the consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.

COVID-19

The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected and will continue to affect economies and businesses around the world. To date, various governmental authorities and private enterprises have implemented numerous measures to contain the pandemic, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns, which have led to severe disruptions to the global economies that may continue for a prolonged duration and trigger a recession or a period of economic slowdown. The magnitude and duration of the resulting decline in business activity and operations cannot be measured with any degree of certainty. Indeed, during the pandemic, Kaleyra experienced fluctuations in its services carrying less revenue-generating traffic in areas subject to "shelter in place" restrictions or related government orders. Nonetheless, in the year ended December 31, 2021, Kaleyra accounted for increasing revenues and gross margin when compared to the same period of prior year, mainly driven by the newly acquired business of mGage. At this stage, the extent and duration of the pandemic, and its foreseeable unfolding following worldwide vaccine campaigns, is still uncertain and difficult to predict, also considering the severity of the surge in the Omicron variant strain. Kaleyra is actively monitoring and managing its response and assessing actual and potential impacts to its operating results and financial condition, which could also impact trends and expectations.

Preference shares liabilities and accrued performance bonuses

During fiscal year 2020, following the agreement with the eligible employees of the preference shares to pay performance bonuses for a total amount of $3.5 million, as a replacement of the preference shares obligation, the performance bonus obligation payable to the eligible employees was paid in two different installments of $1.4 million on August 31, 2020, and of $883,000 on November 30, 2020.

Following the full and final settlement agreements signed with the eligible employees on February 3, 2021, the previously outstanding performance bonus obligation of $1.2 million payable to the eligible employees under the Solutions Infini 2018 Purchase Agreement was paid in full and as such the obligation terminated pursuant to its terms and no performance bonus obligation remained outstanding as of December 31, 2021.

Preference shares liabilities amounted to zero as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, as such no Company's preference shares obligation remained outstanding as of December 31, 2021.

Revenue

In 2021, revenue increased by $120.4 million, or 82%, compared to 2020. This increase was mainly driven by the organic growth of the Kaleyra legacy businesses, representing 25% of the aggregate growth period over period, and the impact of the revenues from the newly acquired businesses of mGage and Bandyer, which contributed in aggregate $83.1 million.

Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit

In 2021, cost of revenue increased by $87.3 million, or 71%, compared to 2020. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to the impact of the cost of revenue of the newly acquired businesses of mGage and Bandyer and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. In 2021, gross profit increased by 135% compared to 2020, mainly as a result of the contributions of Kaleyra Inc. US and Bandyer.

Operating Expenses

In 2021, research and development expenses increased by $8.7 million, compared to 2020. Research and development expenses included $3.7 million of stock-based compensation in 2021, compared to $4.0 million of

stock-based compensation and $524,000for the Solutions Infini performance bonuses and preference shares amendment in 2020. Excluding such costs and the $5.2 million capitalized software development costs, compared to $2.4million capitalized costs in 2020, research and development expenses would have increased by $13.1 million mainly due to an increase in headcount compared to the prior period and to theimpact of research and development expensesof the newly acquired businesses ofmGageandBandyer, representing 61% of the increase in research and development expenses.

In 2021, sales and marketing expenses increased by $8.2 million, compared to 2020. Sales and marketing expenses included $2.1 million of stock-based compensation in 2021, compared to $3.9 million of stock-based compensation and $1.1 million for the Solutions Infini performance bonuses and preference shares amendment in 2020. Excluding such costs, sales and marketing expense would have increased by $11.2 million. Such increase was primarily driven by the impact of sales and marketing expenses of the newly acquired businesses of mGage and Bandyer and the amortization of acquired intangible assets, representing 86% of the increase in sales and marketing expenses, and an increase in headcount compared to same period last year.

In 2021, general and administrative expenses increased by $22.8 million compared to 2020. General and administrative expenses included (i) $14.2 million of stock-based compensation in 2021, compared to $11.2 million in 2020; and (ii) $5.7 million of mGage and Bandyer acquisition transaction costs and $4.9 million of transaction costs and costs pertaining to initial public company compliance in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excluding such costs, general and administrative expenses would have increased by $18.9 million, mainly due to an increase in the headcount compared to the same period of last year and mGage transaction-related advisory costs.

Financial Expense, Net

In 2021, financial expense, net increased by $7.3 million, compared to 2020. Such increase in financial expense is mainly attributable to the accrued contractual interest expense on the Merger Convertible Notes and amortization of issuance costs amounting to $7.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, and to the change in the fair value of the private warrant liability of $546,000, partially offset by the reversal of interest expense of $659,000 previously accrued on a forward share purchase agreement in 2021 compared to 2020. The same period last year accounted for the reversal of interest expense of $417,000 previously accrued on the preference share obligations related to the amendment signed in January 2020. Excluding the change in the fair value of the warrant of $546,000, the interest expense on convertible notes of $8.3 million and the non-recurring reversal of interest expense on a forward share purchase agreement and preference share obligations, amounting to $659,000 and $417,000, respectively, financial expense, net would have decreased by $1.2 million.

Foreign Currency Loss

In 2021, foreign currency loss decreased by $1.3 million, compared to 2020. Such change was mainly attributable to the effects of the fluctuation of the Indian Rupee and Euro against the U.S. dollar.

Income Tax Benefit

In 2021 and in 2020, income tax benefit amounted to $7.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively. As a percentage of loss before income taxes in 2021 and 2020, income tax benefit accounted for 18% and 8%, respectively. The income tax benefit in 2021 is principally due to acquirer valuation allowance reductions as result of ASC 805 purchase accounting adjustments. The income tax benefit in 2020 is principally due to the deferred tax benefit related to the net operating loss carryforwards.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $90.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, $1.7 million of restricted cash and $6.2 million of short-term investments with maturity terms between 4 and 12 months held in India. Of the $97.9 million in cash, restricted cash and short-term investments, $46.2 million was held in U.S. banks, $38.4 million was held in Italy, $10.2 million was held in India with the remainder held in other banks. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $33.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, $4.8 million of short-term investments and no restricted cash.

The consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 includes total current assets of $192.2 million and total current liabilities of $111.4 million, resulting in net current assets of $80.7 million.

On February 18, 2021, and for the purposes of raising the cash portion of the consideration for the Merger,Kaleyraentered into the PIPE Subscription Agreements with the PIPE Investors and the Convertible Note Subscription Agreements with the Convertible Note Investors. Pursuant to these agreements, and prior to the closing of the Merger on June 1, 2021,Kaleyraissued an aggregate of $105 million or 8,400,000 shares ofKaleyracommon stock to the PIPE Investors at $12.50 per share and $200 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured Merger Convertible Notes.

On February 25, 2021, in accordance with the terms of the agreement ("Confirmation"), Nomura Global Financial Products, Inc. ("NGFP") fully terminated the Forward Transaction and made a payment in the aggregate amount of $17.0 million to Kaleyra. Following the cash settlement of the Forward Transaction mentioned above, the Forward Transaction with NGFP has terminated pursuant to the terms of the Confirmation, and as a result the Company has no further obligations.

Management currently plans to retain the cash in the jurisdictions where these funds are currently held. Kaleyra believes its cash, cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings will be sufficient to support its planned operations for at least the next 12 months.

Kaleyra finances its operations through a combination of cash generated from operations and from borrowings under Kaleyra bank facilities primarily with banks located in Italy, as well as proceeds from equity offerings and convertible note arrangements. Kaleyra's long-term cash needs primarily include meeting debt service requirements, working capital requirements and capital expenditures.

Kaleyra may also pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that may impact its future cash requirements. There are a number of factors that may negatively impact its available sources of funds in the future including the ability to generate cash from operations, obtain additional financing or refinance existing short-term debt obligations, including those related to acquisitions completed in prior periods. The amount of cash generated from operations is dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of Kaleyra's business strategies and worldwide economic conditions. The amount of debt available under future financings is dependent on Kaleyra's ability to maintain adequate cash flow for debt service and sufficient collateral, and general financial conditions in Kaleyra's market.

As noted above, Kaleyra entered into the Convertible Note Subscription Agreements with the Convertible Note Investors pursuant to which Kaleyra agreed to issue $200 million in aggregate principal of Merger Convertible Notes. Subject to the terms of the Merger Convertible Notes, Kaleyra may opportunistically raise debt capital, subject to market and other conditions, to refinance its existing capital structure at a lower cost of capital and extend the maturity period of certain debt. Additionally, Kaleyra may also raise debt capital for strategic opportunities which may include acquisitions of additional companies, and general corporate purposes. If additional financing is required from outside sources, Kaleyra may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to it or at all. If Kaleyra is unable to raise additional capital when desired, Kaleyra's business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.

Kaleyra has a number of long-standing business and banking relationships with major Italian commercial banks where it maintains both cash accounts and a credit relationship. Historically, Kaleyra has used cash generated from operations and other sources to fund its growth and investment opportunities. As Kaleyra's management made the decision to expand its operations outside of Italy and acquire additional companies, it took on certain additional financing in order to fund cash payments due on the acquisitions. As of December 31, 2021, Kaleyra's total bank and other borrowings, including amounts drawn under the revolving credit line facilities was $38.7 million ($48.0 million as of December 31, 2020).

Kaleyra has credit line facilities of $6.7 million as of December 31, 2021, of which $5.3 million has been used. As of December 31, 2020, Kaleyra had credit line facilities of $7.7 million, of which $5.3 million had been used. Amounts drawn under the credit line facilities are collateralized by specific customer trade receivables and funds available under the line are limited based on eligible receivables.

Notes Payable - Other

On April 16, 2020, in connection with the Business Combination, Kaleyra entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release (the "Settlement Agreement") with its financial advisory service firms, Cowen and Company, LLC ("Cowen") and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, ("Chardan" and collectively the "Service Firms"), pursuant to which it agreed to pay an affiliate of Cowen, Cowen Investments II LLC ("Cowen Investments"), and

Chardan, in full satisfaction of all amounts owed to the Service Firms as of December 31, 2019, $5.4 million in the aggregate, as follows: (i) $2.7 million in the aggregate in common stock ofKaleyra(the "Settlement Shares") to be issued the business day prior to the filing of a resale registration statement for such Settlement Shares (the "Resale Registration Statement"), (ii) convertible notes totaling $2.7 million in the aggregate with a maturity date three years after issuance and bearing interest at five percent (5%) per annum (but with lower interest rates if the notes are repaid earlier than one year or two years after issuance) and with interest paid in arrears to the payee on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, with such convertible notes to also be issued the business day prior to the filing of the Resale Registration Statement and (iii) in the event that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below) would otherwise be exceeded upon delivery of the Settlement Shares above, a warrant agreement also to be entered into with and issued to the Services Firms the business day prior to the filing of the Resale Registration Statement, whereby the amount of common stock ofKaleyraby which the Beneficial Ownership Limitation would otherwise have been exceeded upon delivery of the Settlement Shares will be substituted for by warrants with an exercise price of $0.01 per share issued pursuant to a Warrant Agreement (the "Warrant Agreement") and the common stock underlying the Warrant Agreement (the "Warrant Shares"). The Beneficial Ownership Limitation shall initially be 4.99% of the number of shares of the common stock outstanding ofKaleyraimmediately after giving effect to the issuance of these shares of common stock. The number of Settlement Shares was calculated using as the price per Settlement Share an amount equal to a fifteen percent (15%) discount to the ten-day (10-day) trailing dollar volume-weighted average price for the common stock ofKaleyraon the NYSE American LLC stock exchange (the "VWAP") on the business day immediately prior to the date on whichKaleyrafiles the Resale Registration Statement. In addition, the price per share for determining the number of shares of common stock ofKaleyrato be issued upon the conversion of the convertible notes shall be a five percent (5%) premium to the ten-day (10-day) trailing VWAP as of the date immediately prior to the issuance date of the convertible notes, rounded down to the nearest whole number.

On May 1, 2020, in connection with the Settlement Agreement, Kaleyra issued: (i) an aggregate of 440,595 Settlement Shares to Cowen Investments and Chardan, consisting of 374,506 Settlement Shares issued to Cowen Investments, and 66,089 Settlement Shares issued to Chardan; and (ii) convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2.7 million to Cowen Investments and Chardan, consisting of a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $2.3 million issued to Cowen Investments (the "Cowen Note") and a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $405,000 issued to Chardan (the "Chardan Note"). The unpaid principal of the Cowen Note was convertible at the option of Cowen Investments into 303,171 shares of common stock of Kaleyra, if there has been no principal reduction, and the unpaid principal of the Chardan Note is convertible at the option of Chardan into 53,501 shares of common stock of Kaleyra, if there has been no principal reduction. As the Beneficial Ownership Limitation was not triggered by the issuance of the Settlement Shares, no Warrant Agreement was necessary and no warrants were issued.

On February 4, 2021, Cowen Investments elected to convert the outstanding amount of the Cowen Note into 303,171 shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the Cowen Note, and as a result the Company has no further obligations with respect to the Cowen Note.

As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding amount of the Chardan Note was $405,000 and accrued interest was $34,000.

Notes Payable to the Sellers

As mentioned above, at the Closing of the Business Combination, Kaleyra issued unsecured convertible promissory notes to each of Esse Effe and Maya in the amount of $6.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively, and also issued other unsecured promissory notes to each of Esse Effe and Maya in the identical respective amounts (the "Notes payable to the Sellers"). The unsecured promissory notes held by Esse Effe and Maya were paid in full during fiscal year 2020 and no amount remains outstanding for such notes as of December 31, 2021. Interest on the Notes Payable to the Sellers shall accrue at a fixed interest rate equal to the one-year U.S. dollar LIBOR interest rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the date of the Business Combination, plus a margin of one percent (1%) per annum.

On the fifteen-month anniversary of the Business Combination date or February 25, 2021, fifty percent (50%) of the previously outstanding amount of the unsecured convertible promissory notes held by Esse Effe and Maya was repaid, with a total of $3.0 million and $750,000 in principal and $176,000 and $44,000 in accrued interest

being paid to Esse Effe and Maya, respectively, pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Convertible Notes.

Under the terms of the unsecured convertible promissory notes, the outstanding principal balance of the notes, plus all accrued and unpaid interest and fees due under these notes, became due and payable, upon the receipt by the Company of cash proceeds of an equity financing in an aggregate gross amount of $105.0 million or 8,400,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock at $12.50 per share issued to the PIPE Investors in the private placement equity financing event immediately prior to the closing of the Merger Agreement of June 1, 2021. The principal amount of $3.8 million plus accrued interest of $84,000 for the unsecured convertible promissory notes held by Esse Effe and Maya was paid in full on June 2, 2021. Following the payment of the previously outstanding amount of convertible notes, the Notes Payable to Sellers terminated pursuant to their terms and no further amounts were due.

Forward Share Purchase Agreements obligations

On February 25, 2021, in accordance with the terms of the Confirmation, NGFP fully terminated the Forward Transaction and made a payment in the aggregate amount of $17.0 million to Kaleyra. Following the cash settlement of the Forward Transaction mentioned above, the Forward Transaction with NGFP has terminated pursuant to the terms of the Confirmation, and as a result the Company has no further obligations.

During the period from January 25, 2021 through March 2, 2021, Yakira provided notice to the Company that it sold all but 219 of the 43,930 shares that it held on December 31, 2020 in the open market at a price above $11.00 per share that were subject to the Third Yakira Amendment. On March 29, 2021 Yakira provided notice to the Company that it would not require the Company to purchase its remaining 219 shares by the term date of March 31, 2021. Following the sale of shares and the lapse of the Third Yakira Amendment mentioned above, the forward share purchase agreement with Yakira terminated pursuant to its terms, and as a result the Company has no further obligations under the Yakira Purchase Agreement. As of December 31, 2021 there are no outstanding obligations under the Forward Share Purchase Agreement.

Merger Convertible Notes

On February 18, 2021, in support of the consummation of the Merger, Kaleyra entered into Convertible Note Subscription Agreements, each dated February 18, 2021, with the Convertible Note Investors. In June 2021, the Company issued the Merger Convertible Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $200 million. The Company incurred $11.4 million of issuance costs as a result of the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notes.

In connection with the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notes pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Note Subscription Agreements, the Company entered into an indenture (the "Indenture") with Wilmington Trust, National Association, a national banking association, in its capacity as trustee thereunder (the "Indenture Trustee"), in respect of the $200 million of Merger Convertible Notes that were issued to the Convertible Note Investors.

The Merger Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.125% per annum, payable semi-annually, in arrears on each June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2021, to holders of record at the close of business on the preceding May 15 and November 15, respectively. The Merger Convertible Notes are convertible into 11,851,852 shares of Parent Common Stock at a conversion price of $16.875 per share of Parent Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, and mature five years after their issuance. The Company may, at its election, force conversion of the Merger Convertible Notes after (i) the first anniversary of the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notes, subject to a holder's prior right to convert, if the last reported sale price of the Parent Common Stock exceeds 150% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter and (ii) the second anniversary of the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notes, subject to a holder's prior right to convert, if the last reported sale price of the Parent Common Stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. Following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if the Company forces a mandatory conversion, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Merger Convertible Notes in connection with such a corporate event or has its Merger Convertible Notes mandatorily converted, as the case may be. In addition, in the event that a holder of the Merger Convertible Notes elects to convert its Merger Convertible Notes prior to the third anniversary of the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notes, the Company will be obligated to pay an amount equal to twelve months of interest, or if on or after such third anniversary of the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notes,

any remaining amounts that would be owed to, but excluding, the fourth anniversary of the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notes (the "Interest Make-Whole Payment"). The Interest Make-Whole Payment will be payable in cash or shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in the Indenture.

Upon the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notes management made the assessment whether the convertible instrument contained embedded conversion features for bifurcation and concluded that such embedded conversion features met the definition of a derivative but qualified for the scope exception under ASC 815-10-15-74(a) as they are indexed to the Company's stock and qualify for classification within stockholders' equity. Management determined that the Interest Make-Whole Payment feature met the definition of a derivative but did not fall within the above scope exception, nonetheless its value was de minimis and as such no amount was recorded at the time of the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notes nor at any subsequent reporting date. Management will continue to monitor the valuation of the Interest Make-Whole Payment provision and assess the need to record a liability in future periods.

As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding amount of the Merger Convertible Notes was $189.7 million, net of issuance costs. During the years ended December 31, 2021, contractual interest expense on the Merger Convertible Notes amounted to $7.1 million, and amortization of the debt issuance costs amounted to $1.1 million. The liability is included in the consolidated balance sheet line item "Long-term portion of notes payable" and the interest expense is included in "Financial expense, net" on the consolidated statements of operations.

Liquidity

The Company evaluated its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has negative cash flows from operating activities through December 31, 2021. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 includes total current assets of $192.2 million and total current liabilities of $111.4 million, resulting in net current assets of $80.7 million.

The Business Combination generated significant obligations including (i) $13.1 million of liabilities related to non-recurring Business Combination transaction related costs; (ii) $15.0 million of deferred consideration to the Sellers in the Business Combination transaction; (iii) $13.2 million of net obligations under certain Shares Purchase Forward Agreements entered into by GigCapital, Inc. prior to the Business Combination; and (iv) $3.6 million of notes payable acquired as a result of the Business Combination. As of December 31, 2021, the Company only had $405,000 of remaining obligations as a result of the Business Combination.

On February 18, 2021, and for the purposes of raising the cash portion of the consideration for the Merger, the Company entered into the PIPE Subscription Agreements with the PIPE Investors and the Convertible Note Subscription Agreements with the Convertible Note Investors. Pursuant to these agreements, and prior to the closing of the Merger on June 1, 2021, the Company issued and sold in private placements an aggregate of $105 million or 8,400,000 shares of the Company's common stock to the PIPE Investors at $12.50 per share, and $200 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured Merger Convertible Notes.

Considering the effects of the financings described above and the typical financial cycle of the Company, the Company's management believes that the Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, debt and equity financings and availability of borrowings, will be sufficient to support its planned operations for at least the next 12 months from the date these consolidated financial statements were issued.

The unpaid principal of the Chardan Note is convertible at the option of Chardan into 53,501 shares of common stock of the Company, if there has been no principal reduction.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Kaleyra did not have any relationships with any entities or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purposes entities established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for other purposes.

Seasonality

Historically, Kaleyra has experienced clear seasonality in its revenue generation, with slower traction in the first calendar quarter, and increasing revenues as the year progresses. Kaleyra typically experiences higher revenues in messaging and notification services during the fourth calendar quarter. This patterned revenue generation behavior occurs due to Kaleyra's customers sending more messages to their end-user customers who are engaged in consumer transactions at the end of the calendar year, resulting in an increase in notifications of electronic payments, credit card transactions and e-commerce.

Taxes

Kaleyra files income tax returns in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions including Italy, Germany, United Kingdom and India.

For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Kaleyra's consolidated effective tax rate was 18% and 8%, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the reductions to valuation allowance under the acquisition method, the increase of costs non-deductible for tax purposes recorded in 2021 compared to 2020 and to the increase in taxes on undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries in 2021 compared to 2020. With the exception of post-acquisition losses occurring after May 31, 2021, domestic net operating loss carryforwards and Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 163(j) deferred interest deductions are subject to change in ownership limitations under IRC Section 382.

As of December 31, 2021, Kaleyra had $4.3 million of undistributed earnings and profits generated by a foreign subsidiary (Solutions Infini FZE) for which deferred tax liabilities have been recorded. Should the above undistributed earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, the distributions would result in $642,000 withholding tax.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company has federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards totaling $157.9 million, $177.8 million and $5.4 million, respectively. If not utilized, federal net operating losses of $78.7 million will expire at various dates from 2026 through 2037, and $79.2 million have an indefinite life. State net operating losses of $168.9 million will expire at various dates from 2023 through 2041, and $8.9 million have an indefinite life. Foreign net operating losses will expire at various dates from 2023 through 2027.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP applicable for an "emerging growth company" as defined in the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides, among others, that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In particular, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would apply to private companies. For the purpose of these consolidated financial statements, Kaleyra availed itself of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, as a result, did not adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for public companies except for ASU2020-06 and ASU 2017-04.

Preparation of these financial statements requires Kaleyra to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. Kaleyra bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable. In many instances, Kaleyra could have reasonably used different accounting estimates and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, the future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. Kaleyra believes that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding the historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving judgments and estimates.

Business Combinations

Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired

and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwillthe Company hasacquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired developed technologies,existing customer relationships,uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.

The authoritative guidance allows a measurement period of the purchase price allocation that ends when the entity has obtained all relevant information about facts that existed at the acquisition date, and that cannot exceed one year from the date of acquisition. As a result, during the measurement period the Company may record adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent that it identifies adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments will be recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.

Revenue Recognition

Kaleyra derives the revenue primarily from usage-based fees earned from the sale of communications services offered through Platforms access to large enterprises, as well as small and medium-sized customers. Revenue can be billed in advance or in arrears depending on the term of the agreement; for the majority of customers revenue is invoiced on a monthly basis in arrears.

Effective January 1, 2019, Kaleyra adopted Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers", and outlines a single set of comprehensive principles for recognizing revenue under US GAAP. Among other things, ASC 606 requires entities to assess the products or services promised in contracts with customers at contract inception to determine the appropriate unit at which to record revenue, which is referred to as a performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services.

Revenue Recognition Policy

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration Kaleyra expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. Kaleyra enters into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally not capable of being distinct and are therefore accounted for as a series of distinct services under a single performance obligation in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-14 and ASC 606-10-25-15. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for any credits and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

Kaleyra determines revenue recognition through the following steps:

• Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;

• Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;

• Determination of the transaction price;

• Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

• Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.

No significant judgments are required in determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations and should be accounted for separately versus together, or to determine the stand-alone selling price.

Kaleyra's arrangements do not contain general rights of return. The contracts do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the applications. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in trade receivables and in revenue or deferred revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.

Nature of Products and Services

Kaleyra's revenue is primarily derived from usage-based fees earned from the sale of communications services offered through Platforms access to large enterprises, as well as small and medium-sized customers.

Platformsaccessservices areconsidered a monthly series comprising of one performance obligation and usage-based fees are recognized as revenue in the period in which the usage occurs. Revenue from usage-based fees represented 93% and 98% of total revenue in the years ended December 31,2021and 2020, respectively.

Subscription-based fees are derived from certain term-based contracts, such as with the sales of short code subscriptions and customer support. Term-based contracts revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning on the date that the service is made available to the customer. Revenue from term-based fees represented 7% and 2% of total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units

Kaleyra measures and recognizes the compensation expense for RSUs granted to employees, directors and advisory board members, based on the fair value of the award on the grant date.

RSUs give an employee an interest in company stock but they have no tangible value until vesting is complete. RSUs are equity classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date and recognized as expense over the related service or performance period. Kaleyra elected to account for forfeitures as they occur. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period.

Stock-Based Compensation

Kaleyra accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance, stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.

As mentioned above, in November 2019, Kaleyra adopted its 2019 EIP. The EIP provides for the award of stock-based compensation. In 2021, Kaleyra granted RSUs to certain employees, directors and advisory board members of the Company for a total of 3,305,796 RSUs shares with an aggregate grant date fair value of $40.0 million, based on a per share weighted-average grant date fair value of $12.10.

Internal-Use Software Development Costs

Certain costs of the technology platform and other software applications developed for internal use are capitalized. Kaleyra capitalizes qualifying internal-use software development costs that are incurred during the application development stage of projects with a useful life greater than one year. Capitalization of costs begins when two criteria are met: (i) the preliminary project stage is completed, and (ii) it is probable that the software will be completed and used for its intended purpose. Capitalization ceases when the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, including the completion of all-significant testing. Costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements are also capitalized when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Any costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades and enhancements are expensed. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation operating activities are expensed as incurred.

Capitalized costs of the platform and other software applications are included in property and equipment. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software of three to five years on a straight-line basis. Management evaluates the useful life of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could affect the recoverability of these assets. The amortization of costs related to the platform applications is included in cost of revenue, while the amortization of costs related to other software applications developed for internal use is included in research and development expenses.

Kaleyra exercises judgment in determining the point at which various projects may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized. To the extent that there is a change in the manner in which Kaleyra develops and tests new features and functionalities related to the platform, assesses the ongoing value of capitalized assets or determines the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized, the amount of internal-use software development costs capitalized and amortized could change in future periods.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Kaleyra has determined that it operates as three reporting units and has selected December 31 as the date to perform its annual impairment test. In the valuation of goodwill, management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows to be derived from Kaleyra's business. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, Kaleyra may be required to record an impairment for these assets. Management may first evaluate qualitative factors to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and to determine if an impairment test is necessary. Management may choose to proceed directly to the evaluation, bypassing the initial qualitative assessment. The impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is allocated to its net book value, including goodwill. A goodwill impairment loss would be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. No goodwill impairment charges have been recorded for any period presented.

Recoverability of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets

Kaleyra evaluates long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If such evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset or the asset group is not recoverable, any impairment loss would be equal to the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value. There was no impairment during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability approach method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the consolidated financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company's accounting for deferred taxes involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of its net deferred tax assets. The Company primarily considered such factors as its history of operating losses, the nature of the Company's deferred tax assets, and the timing, likelihood and amount, if any, of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences and carryforwards become deductible. A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to the annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond Kaleyra's control. Interest rate risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in the level of interest rates and the spread between different interest rates. Kaleyra's interest rates on the bank borrowing held by Italian commercial banks is at market in Italy and well below market in other geographical locations. Therefore, Kaleyra does not believe there is material exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt.

Foreign Currency Risk

Kaleyra's consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars while the functional currency of Kaleyra S.p.A. is the Euro. The functional currency of Solutions Infini is the Indian Rupee, the functional currency of Kaleyra Inc., Buc Mobile, Campaign Registry and Kaleyra US Inc. is the U.S. Dollar, the functional currency of mGage Europe Limited is the Great Britain Pound and the functional currency of Solutions Infini FZE is the United Arab Emirates Dirham.

Each company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than its functional currency at period-end exchange rates and non-monetary items are remeasured at historical rates.

Remeasurement adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as foreign currency income (loss) in the period of occurrence.

For legal entities where the functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar, including Kaleyra S.p.A., adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements into U.S. dollar are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity (deficit). Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollar at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Kaleyra does not engage on a regular basis in any hedging activity to reduce Kaleyra's potential exposure to currency fluctuations, although Kaleyra may elect to do so in the future if use of derivatives would be beneficial to Kaleyra.

On June 1, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of mGage for a total purchase price of $218.0 million, consisting of both cash and common stock consideration. On August 30, 2021, the Company prepared and delivered to the Stockholder Representative a written statement (the "Post-Closing Statement") setting forth the calculation of closing cash and closing net working capital which ultimately resulted in the final Merger consideration to be equal to $217.0 million pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The original cash consideration amounted to $199.2 million of which $198.6 million was paid on June 1, 2021 and the remaining amount was settled through the period ended September 30, 2021. The original cash consideration was reduced by $997,000 due to a working capital adjustment. The common stock consideration was paid with the issuance to Vivial's former equity holders of a total of 1,600,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock at $11.77 per share closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of issuance, equal to $18.8 million.

KALEYRA, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS

Kaleyra, Inc., formerly GigCapital, Inc., (hereinafter "Kaleyra" or the "Company") was incorporated in Delaware on October 9, 2017. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.

On February 22, 2019, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement") by and among the Company, Kaleyra S.p.A., Shareholder Representative Services LLC, (the "Seller Representative") as representative for the holders of the ordinary shares of Kaleyra S.p.A. immediately prior to the closing of the business combination with Kaleyra (the "Business Combination"), and all of the stockholders of all of the Kaleyra S.p.A. stock (collectively, such Kaleyra S.p.A. stockholders, the "Sellers"), for the purpose of the Company acquiring all of the shares of Kaleyra S.p.A.

As a result of the Business Combination, which closed on November 25, 2019, the Company (headquartered in Milan, Italy) became a multi-channel integrated communication services provider on a global scale. Kaleyra operates in the Communications Platform as a Service ("CPaaS") market with operations primarily in Italy, India, Dubai and the United States. In connection with the closing, the Company changed its name from GigCapital, Inc. to Kaleyra, Inc.

Kaleyra provides mobile communication services to financial institutions, e-commerce players, OTTs, software companies, logistic enablers, healthcare providers, retailers, and other large organizations worldwide. Through its proprietary cloud communications platforms (collectively as the "Platforms"), Kaleyra manages multi-channel integrated communication services on a global scale, consisting of messaging, rich messaging and instant messaging (including WhatsApp®), video, push notifications, e-mail, programmable voice services, Interactive Voice Response ("IVR") configurations, and chatbots.

On July 29, 2020, Kaleyra registered a German branch of Kaleyra S.p.A. with the German Chamber Tax Authority of Commerce. Kaleyra established its branch in Germany, by far the most important country in Europe to Kaleyra after Italy, to expand Kaleyra's footprint in Central Europe and the Nordic countries and allow it to leverage Kaleyra's trusted business solutions for customers in additional jurisdictions.

Kaleyra's subsidiary, Campaign Registry Inc., a systems initiative to reduce spam by collecting robotically driven campaign information and processing and sharing that information with mobile operators and the messaging ecosystem, began its soft launch during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, ending up with its first revenue contracts in the second half of the year 2020.

On February 18, 2021, Kaleyra entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Vivial, Inc. ("Vivial") for the acquisition of the business known as mGage ("mGage"), a leading global mobile messaging provider in the United States (the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the "Merger").

On June 1, 2021, Kaleyra completed its acquisition of mGage for a total purchase price of $218.0 million. The Merger consideration consisted of both cash consideration and common stock consideration. On August 30, 2021, the Company prepared and delivered to the Stockholder Representative a written statement (the "Post-Closing Statement") setting forth the calculation of closing cash and closing net working capital which ultimately resulted in the final Merger consideration to be equal to $217.0 million pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The cash consideration amounted to $199.2 million of which $198.6 million was paid on June 1, 2021 and the remaining amount was settled during the period ended September 30, 2021, including a working capital adjustment of $997,000. The common stock consideration was paid with the issuance to Vivial's former equity holders of a total of 1,600,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock at the $11.77 per share closing price of Kaleyra common stock on the date of issuance, equal to $18.8 million. In support of the consummation of the Merger, on February 18, 2021, Kaleyra entered into subscription agreements (the "PIPE Subscription Agreements"), with certain institutional investors (the "PIPE Investors"), pursuant to which, among other things, Kaleyra agreed to issue and sell, in private placements to close immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, an aggregate of 8,400,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock to the PIPE Investors at $12.50 per share. Kaleyra also entered into convertible note subscription agreements (the "Convertible Note Subscription Agreements") with certain institutional investors (the "Convertible Note Investors"), pursuant to which Kaleyra agreed to issue and sell, in private placements to close immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, $200 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible notes (the "Merger Convertible Notes").

On July 1, 2021,Kaleyracompleted a company reorganization of the acquired business ofmGagethrough the initial dissolution of the Delaware single member LLCs of Vivial Holdings, LLC, Vivial Networks, LLC, and the following merger ofmGage, LLC into the surviving holding company, Vivial Inc., which subsequently changed its name intoKaleyraUS Inc., as a result of the reorganization. As a result of the merger,KaleyraUS Inc. became the holding company of the following entities: one hundred percent (100%) direct ownership ofmGageEurope Ltd. (UK) and one hundred percent (100%) direct ownership ofmGageSA de SV (Mexico).

On July 8, 2021, Kaleyra completed the acquisition of Bandyer Srl ("Bandyer") for cash consideration of $15.4 million. Bandyer offers cloud-based audio/video communications services via Web Real Time Communication ("WebRTC") technology to financial institutions, retail companies, utilities, industries, insurance companies, human resources, and digital healthcare organizations. Bandyer provides customers with programmable audio/video APIs and Software Development Kits ("SDKs") based on WebRTC technology for a variety of use cases, including Augmented Reality ("AR") applications for smart glasses.

Effective August 31, 2021, the common stock of the Company ceased trading on the NYSE American and commenced trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "KLR". Kaleyra's warrants continue to trade on the NYSE American under the symbol "KLR WS".

On October 11, 2021, Kaleyra Africa Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kaleyra Inc., was incorporated under the law of South Africa with the registered office in Waterfall City, Gauteng. This newly established subsidiary is part of Kaleyra's broader strategic plan of expanding into emerging markets whereby South Africa will serve as Kaleyra's hub to enter the entire African market.

On November 15, 2021, pursuant to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, Kaleyra Dominicana, S.R.L., ninety-nine percent (99%) direct ownership of Kaleyra US Inc. and one percent (1%) direct ownership of Kaleyra Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the Dominican Republic with the registered office in Santo Domingo. This newly established subsidiary is aimed to provide the Kaleyra group with back-office technology support and engage in product development and innovation.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP applicable for an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ("JOBS Act"). The JOBS Act provides, among others, that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In particular, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would apply to private companies. For the purpose of these consolidated financial statements, the Company availed itself of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, as a result, did not adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for public companies except for ASU2020-06 and ASU 2017-04.

Liquidity

The Company evaluated its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has negative cash flows from operating activities through December 31, 2021. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 includes total current assets of $192.2 million and total current liabilities of $111.4 million, resulting in net current assets of $80.7 million.

The Business Combination generated significant obligations including (i) $13.1 million of liabilities related to non-recurring Business Combination transaction related costs; (ii) $15.0 million of deferred consideration to the Sellers in the Business Combination transaction; (iii) $13.2 million of net obligations under certain Shares Purchase Forward Agreements entered into by GigCapital, Inc. prior to the Business Combination; and (iv) $3.6 million of notes payable acquired as a result of the Business Combination. As of December 31, 2021, the Company only had $405,000 of remaining obligations as a result of the Business Combination.

On February 18, 2021, and for the purposes of raising the cash portion of the consideration for the Merger, the Company entered into the PIPE Subscription Agreements with the PIPE Investors and the Convertible Note

Subscription Agreements with the Convertible Note Investors. Pursuant to these agreements, and prior to the closing of the Merger on June 1, 2021, the Company issued and sold in private placements an aggregate of $105million or8,400,000shares of the Company's common stock to the PIPE Investors at $12.50per share, and $200million aggregate principal amount of unsecured Merger Convertible Notes.

Considering the effects of the financings described above and the typical financial cycle of the Company, the Company's management believes that the Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, debt and equity financings and availability of borrowings, will be sufficient to support its planned operations for at least the next 12 months from the date these consolidated financial statements were issued.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Kaleyra S.p.A., Solutions Infini, Buc Mobile, Campaign Registry and Kaleyra US Inc., which represent its major operations. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are used for, but not limited to, revenue recognition; allowance for doubtful accounts; valuation of the Company's stock-based awards; recoverability of goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets; capitalization and useful life of the Company's capitalized internal-use software development costs; fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill; accruals, including tax related provision and valuation allowance on deferred taxes. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under current circumstances. However, future events are subject to change and best estimates and judgments may require further adjustments; therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Management periodically evaluates such estimates and they are adjusted prospectively based upon such periodic evaluation. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus ("COVID-19").

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade receivables. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities with financial institutions that management believes are financially sound.

The Company sells its services to a wide variety of customers. If the financial condition or results of operations of any significant customers deteriorate substantially, operating results could be adversely affected. To reduce credit risk, management performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of significant customers. The Company maintains reserves for estimated credit losses on customer accounts when considered necessary. Actual credit losses may differ from the Company's estimates. In both of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were zero customers that individually accounted for more than 10%of the Company's consolidated total revenue. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, one individual customer accounted for more than 10%of the Company's consolidated total trade receivables. In particular as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, trade receivables accounted for by that one customer amounted to $9.6 million and $4.5 million, respectively.

Warrant Liability

The Company accounts for warrants for shares of the Company's common stock that are not indexed to its own stock as liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. The warrants are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized in "Financial expense, net" on the consolidated statements of operations. The liability is included in the consolidated balance sheet line item "Other long-term liabilities". The Company will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of the exercise or expiration of the common stock warrants. At that time, the portion of the warrant liability related to the common stock warrants will be reclassified to additional paid-in capital.

Revenue Recognition

Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" ("ASC 606"). Among other things, ASC 606 requires entities to assess the products or services promised in contracts with customers at contract inception to determine the appropriate unit at which to record revenue, which is referred to as a performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services.

Revenue Recognition Policy

The Company enters into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally not capable of being distinct and are therefore accounted for as a series of distinct services under a single performance obligation in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-14 and ASC 606-10-25-15. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for any credits and any taxes collected from customers. Taxes collected are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:

• Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;

• Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;

• Determination of the transaction price;

• Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

• Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.

No significant judgments are required in determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations and should be accounted for separately versus together, or to determine the stand-alone selling price.

The Company's arrangements do not contain general rights of return. The contracts do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the applications. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in trade receivables and in revenue or deferred revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.

Nature of Products and Services

The Company's revenue is primarily derived from usage-based fees earned from the sale of communications services offered through access to the Platforms to large enterprises, as well as small and medium-sized customers.

The Company's revenue is recognized upon the sending of a SMS message or by the authentication of a financial transaction of an end-user of the Company's customer using the Company's Platforms in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services which is generally based upon agreed fixed prices per unit.

Platforms access services are considered a monthly series comprised of one performance obligation and usage-based fees are recognized as revenue in the period in which the usage occurs. After usage occurs, there are no remaining obligations that would preclude revenue recognition. Revenue from usage-based fees represented 93% and 98% of total revenue, in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Subscription-based fees are derived from certain term-based contracts, such as with the sales of short code subscriptions and customer support, which is generally one year. Term-based contract revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning on the date that the service is made available to the customer. Revenue from term-based fees represented 7% and 2% of total revenue, in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Deferred Revenue

Deferred revenue consists of advance cash payments from customers to be applied against future usage and customer billings in advance of revenues being recognized under the Company's non-cancellable contracts. Deferred revenue is generally expected to be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period and is thus recorded as a current liability. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $9.6 million and $3.7 million, respectively, as deferred revenue on its consolidated balance sheets. In the year ended December 31, 2021, the

Company recognized $3.3 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2020.

Disaggregated Revenue

In general, revenue disaggregated by geography is aligned according to the nature and economic characteristics of the Company's business and provides meaningful disaggregation of the Company's results of operations. Refer to Note 17 - Geographic Information for details of revenue by geographic area.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue consists primarily of costs of communications services purchased from network service providers. Cost of revenue also includes the cost of the Company's cloud infrastructure and technology platform, amortization of capitalized internal-use software development costs related to the platform applications and amortization of developed technology acquired in the business combinations.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, the costs of the technology platform used for staging and development, outsourced engineering services, amortization of capitalized internal-use software development costs related to non-platform applications and an allocation of general overhead expenses. The Company capitalizes the portion of its software development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization.

Internal-Use Software Development Costs

Certain costs of the technology platform and other software applications developed for internal use are capitalized. The Company capitalizes qualifying internal-use software development costs that are incurred during the application development stage of projects with a useful life greater than one year. Capitalization of costs begins when two criteria are met: (i) the preliminary project stage is completed, and (ii) it is probable that the software will be completed and used for its intended purpose. Capitalization ceases when the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, including the completion of all-significant testing. The Company also capitalizes costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality and expenses costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades and enhancements. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation operating activities are expensed as incurred.

Capitalized costs of platform and other software applications are included in property and equipment. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software of three to five years on a straight-line basis. Management evaluates the useful life of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could affect the recoverability of these assets. The amortization of costs related to the platform applications is included in cost of revenue, while the amortization of costs related to other software applications developed for internal use is included in research and development expenses.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $1.7 million and $1.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Advertising costs are included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Marketable Securities

Investments in marketable securities are carried at fair value and classified as short-term investments. Realized gains and losses on marketable securities are included in financial expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, on marketable securities are included in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). In the event the fair value of an investment declines below its cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had marketable securities of $6.2 million and $4.8 million, respectively relating to mutual funds and certificates of deposit with no stated maturity.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company measures and recognizes the compensation expense for restricted stock units ("RSUs") granted to employees, directors and advisory board members, based on the fair value of the award on the grant date.

RSUs give an employee an interest in Company stock but they have no tangible value until vesting is complete. RSUs are equity classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date and recognized as expense over the related service or performance period. The Company elected to account for forfeitures as they occur. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period.

In June 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2018-07, "Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting". The aim of the update is to simplify several aspects of the accounting for nonemployee share-based payment transactions resulting from expanding the scope of Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. As a result, nonemployee share-based payment equity awards are measured at the grant date fair value of the equity instruments, similar to employee share-based payment equity awards.

The Company adopted ASU 2018-07 in 2019, following the adoption of Topic 606. At the transition date, there were no nonemployee share-based compensation awards.

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has defined benefit plans, granted to Italian and Indian employees and regulated by Italian and Indian laws, respectively. The defined benefit plans are calculated based on the employee compensation and the duration of the employment relationship and are paid to the employee upon termination of the employment relationship. The costs of the defined benefit plans reported in the Company's consolidated statements of operations is determined by actuarial calculation performed on an annual basis. The actuarial valuation is performed using the "Projected Unit Credit Method" based on the employees' expected date of separation or retirement.

As a part of the purchase agreement relating to the 2018 acquisition of Solutions Infini by Kaleyra, the Company assumed the obligation to purchase a number of preference shares from certain employees in 2020 at a price determined based on the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") of Solutions Infini for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2020. These preference shares represented compensation for future services for the eligible employees. The Company accounted for the liability related to the preference shares over the relevant period from July 2017 to July 2020, charging the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over that period. See Note 14 - Preference Shares Liabilities.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability approach method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the consolidated financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax amounts are determined by using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.

The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit determined on a cumulative

probability basis that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the position.

The Company records interest and penalties related to an underpayment of income taxes in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of the parent company is the U.S. Dollar. The functional currency of Kaleyra S.p.A. is the Euro, the functional currency of Solutions Infini is the India Rupee, the functional currency of mGage Europe Limited is the Great Britain Pound, the functional currency of Buc Mobile, Campaign Registry and Kaleyra US Inc. is the U.S. Dollar and the functional currency of Solutions Infini FZE is the United Arab Emirates Dirham.

Each company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other that its functional currency at period-end exchange rates and non-monetary items are at historical rates. Remeasurement adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as foreign currency (income) loss in the period of occurrence.

These consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars. For legal entities where the functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements into U.S. Dollars are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity (deficit). Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is other than the U.S. Dollar are translated into US Dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) refers to net loss and other revenue, expenses, gains and losses that, under U.S. GAAP, are recorded as an element of stockholders' equity (deficit) but are excluded from the calculation of net loss. See Note 13 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Earnings (Loss) per Share

The equity structure in the consolidated financial statements following a reverse recapitalization reflects the equity structure of the legal acquiror (the accounting acquiree), including the equity interests issued by the legal acquiror to effect the business combination.

Basic earnings (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. In calculating the weighted-average number of common shares during the period in which the reverse merger occurred (fiscal year 2019):

a. The number of common shares outstanding from the beginning of that period to the acquisition date were computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of common shares of the legal acquiree (accounting acquiror) outstanding during the period multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the merger agreement;

b. The number of common shares outstanding from the acquisition date to the end of that period were the actual number of common shares of the legal acquiror (the accounting acquiree) outstanding during that period.

The basic EPS for each comparative period before the acquisition date presented in the consolidated financial statements following a reverse merger were calculated by dividing (i) by (ii):

i. The income of the legal acquiree attributable to common stockholders in each of those periods;

ii. The legal acquiree's historical weighted average number of common shares outstanding multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the acquisition agreement.

Diluted net income (loss) per share is calculated by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock when determining the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. For purposes of the diluted net income (loss) per share calculation, RSUs, options and warrants to purchase common stock are considered common stock equivalents.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of funds deposited into saving accounts.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consisted of cash deposited into an escrow account with a financial institution as collateral for the purchase consideration to be paid by the Company under the provisions of the Price Adjustment for the Bandyer Acquisition. See Note 5 - Business Combination.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 830) - Restricted Cash" ("ASU 2016-18"). This standard provides guidance on the presentation of restricted cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period amounts shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company adopted ASU 2016-18 in the first quarter of 2019 and applied the guidance retrospectively in the prior period's consolidated statements of cash flows.

Other than the revised consolidated statements of cash flows presentation of restricted cash, the adoption of ASU 2016-18 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

The restricted cash balances as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $1.7 million and zero, respectively.

Trade Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the Company's assessment of its ability to collect on customer trade receivables. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering certain factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of trade receivables balances and other known conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay. In cases where the Company is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer's ability to meet their financial obligations, a specific allowance is recorded against amounts due from the customer which reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes will be collected. The Company writes-off trade receivables against the allowance when a determination is made that the balance is uncollectible, and collection of the receivable is no longer being actively pursued.

The allowance for doubtful accounts was $2.1 million and $850,000 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Property and Equipment, net

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization.

Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

The useful lives of property and equipment are as follows:

Internal-use software development costs …………………………….. 3 - 5 years
Servers ………………………………………………………………...                   3 - 6 years
Office equipment ……………………………………………………...              3 -5 years
Leasehold improvements ……………………………………………...           the shorter of 2 years or the remaining lease term (1)
Furniture and fixtures …………………………………………………            5 - 10 years
Vehicles ……………………………………………………………….                    8 - 10 years
Software ……………………………………………………………….                    3 - 5 years
Other assets ………………………………………………………........            4 - 5 years

Including renewal options

Intangible Assets, net

Intangible assets recorded by the Company are costs directly associated with the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations and with securing legal registration of patents.

Intangible assets with determinable economic lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets arising from business combinations, such as customer relationship and developed technology, were initially recorded at estimated fair value, as discussed below under Business Combinations. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of each asset on a straight-line basis, except for customer relationships of

Buc Mobile and Solutions Infini, which are amortized over the best estimate of their expected useful life using an accelerated method ("sum of years' digits method"), in order to better approximate the pattern in which their economic benefit are expected to be consumed. The Company determines the useful lives of identifiable intangible assets after considering the facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors the Company considers when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the asset, the Company's long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset and other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets without determinable economic lives are carried at cost, notamortizedand reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

The useful lives of the intangible assets are as follows:

Developed technology…………………………………………………....  5 - 15 years
Customer relationships…………………………………………………... 7 - 17 years
Patent …………………………………………………………………….           5 - 10 years
Trade names …………………………………………………………..….       8 years
Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has determined that it operates as three reporting units and has selected December 31 as the date to perform its annual impairment test. In the valuation of goodwill, management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows to be derived from the Company's business. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record an impairment for these assets. Management may first evaluate qualitative factors to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and to determine if an impairment test is necessary. Management may choose to proceed directly to the evaluation, bypassing the initial qualitative assessment. The impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is allocated to its net book value, including goodwill. A goodwill impairment loss would be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. No goodwill impairment charges have been recorded for any period presented.

Recoverability of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets

The Company evaluates long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If such evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset or the asset group is not recoverable, any impairment loss would be equal to the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value. There was no impairment during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Segment Information

The Company's Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker, who reviews the Company's financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating the Company's financial performance. Accordingly, the Company has determined that it operates in a single reporting segment.

Derivatives

The Company has not historically entered into hedging derivatives in the ordinary course of its business. These derivatives include interest rate swaps on the bank borrowings entered into by the Company to finance the acquisitions. These derivatives were not designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. Because hedge accounting was not applied, those derivatives have been recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded in financial expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Forward Share Purchase Agreements

During 2019, the Company entered into certain third-party put option arrangements assuming the obligation to repurchase its common stock at a future date by transferring cash to the third-party under certain conditions described in more detail in Note 10 below. Such obligation has been recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded in financial expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Business Combinations

The Company recognizes identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Examples of estimates and assumptions in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill the Company has acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired developed technologies, existing customer relationships, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.

The authoritative guidance allows a measurement period of the purchase price allocation that ends when the entity has obtained all relevant information about facts that existed at the acquisition date, and that cannot exceed one year from the date of acquisition. As a result, during the measurement period the Company may record adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill to the extent that it identifies adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Upon conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments will be recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments, which include cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade receivables and accounts payable are recorded at their carrying amounts, which approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. All marketable securities are considered available-for-sale and recorded at their estimated fair values. Unrealized gains and losses for marketable securities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). In valuing these items, the Company uses inputs and assumptions that market participants would use to determine their fair value, utilizing valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

Impairments are considered other than temporary if they are related to deterioration in credit risk or if it is likely that the security will be sold before the recovery of its cost basis. Realized gains and losses and declines in value deemed to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

The accounting guidance for fair value provides a framework for measuring fair value, clarifies the definition of fair value, and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The accounting guidance establishes a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value as follows:

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.

Level 2: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.

A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Net cash settlements on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in financial income as part of financial expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2021-04 "Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation- Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815- 40) Issuer's Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options" which clarifies and reduces diversity in an issuer's accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. An entity should measure the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange as follows: i) for a modification or an exchange that is a part of or directly related to a modification or an exchange of an existing debt instrument or line-of-credit or revolving-debt arrangements (hereinafter, referred to as a "debt" or "debt instrument"), as the difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged written call option and the fair value of that written call option immediately before it is modified or exchanged; ii) for all other modifications or exchanges, as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified or exchanged written call option over the fair value of that written call option immediately before it is modified or exchanged. The amendments in this update are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the amendments prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01 "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)", which clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. Specifically, certain provisions in Topic 848, if elected by an entity, apply to derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform. Amendments in this update to the expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 capture the incremental consequences of the scope clarification and tailor the existing guidance to derivative instruments affected by the discounting transition. The amendments in this update apply to all entities that elect to apply the optional guidance in Topic 848. The amendments do not apply to contract modifications made after December 31, 2022 or new hedging relationships entered into after December 31, 2022. For existing hedging relationships evaluated for effectiveness in periods after December 31, 2022, an exception is made for those hedging relationships that apply certain optional expedients in which the accounting effects are recorded through the end of the hedging relationship (including periods after December 31, 2022). The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the optional expedients and exceptions of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06 "Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity" which is aimed to address issues identified as a result of the complexity associated with applying generally accepted accounting principles for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. In addressing the complexity, the FASB focused on amending the guidance on convertible instruments and the guidance on the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity. For convertible instruments, the Board decided to reduce the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models results in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current GAAP. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. The Company adopted the amendments in this update as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year 2021, which resulted in the embedded conversion features of the Merger Convertible Note not being separately recognized from the host contract pursuant to their scope exception from derivative accounting under ASC 815-10-15-74(a). Interest Make-Whole Payment feature met the definition of a derivative but did not fall within the above scope exception,

nonetheless itsvalue was de minimis and as such no amount was recordedin the consolidated financial statementsat the time of the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notesnor at any subsequent reporting date.

In June 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-05 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Leases (Topic 842): Effective dates for certain entities" ("ASU 2020-05"), which provides a limited one year deferral of the effective dates of the following updates (including amendments issued after the issuance of the original update) to provide immediate, near-term relief for certain entities for whom these updates are either currently effective or imminently effective: i) ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("Revenue"); ii) ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("Leases"). In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10 "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates" ("ASU 2019-10"). The amendments in this ASU amended certain effective dates for the above ASU 2016-02, Leases (including amendments issued after the issuance of the original ASU). The effective dates for Leases after applying ASU 2019-10 were as follows: public business entities, excluding emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. All other entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early application continues to be allowed. In ASU 2019-10, the FASB noted that challenges associated with transition to a major update are often magnified for private companies and smaller public companies. Those challenges have been significantly amplified by the current business and capital market disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For this reason, the FASB issued the amendments in ASU 2020-05 by deferring the effective date for one additional year for entities in the "all other" category that have not yet issued their financial statements (or made financial statements available for issuance) reflecting the adoption of Leases. Therefore, under the amendments, Leases (Topic 842) is effective for entities within the "all other" category for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early application continues to be permitted, which means that an entity may choose to implement Leases before those deferred effective dates. The Company expects the adoption to have a material impact to the consolidated balance sheets for the recording of the "right-to-use" asset and corresponding lease liability. The Company plans to adopt the ASU utilizing the modified retrospective transition approach, which will result in an estimated current period adjustment on January 1, 2022 related to the recognition of a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability between $3.0 million and $4.0 million on its consolidated balance sheet.

In February 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-02 "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842), Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section on Effective Date Related to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This ASU applies to all registrants that are creditors in loan transactions that, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on the registrant's financial condition. This ASU guidance is applicable upon a registrant's adoption of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 326. On November 15, 2019, the FASB delayed the effective date of ASC Topic 326 for certain small public companies and other private companies. As amended, the effective date of ASC Topic 326 was delayed until fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 for SEC filers that are eligible to be smaller reporting companies under the SEC's definition, as well as private companies and not-for-profit entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10 "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates". The amendments in ASU 2019-10 amend certain effective dates for the following major ASUs (including amendments issued after the issuance of the original ASU):

a)ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Credit Losses) ("ASU 2016-13"). The amendments in this ASU amend the mandatory effective dates for Credit Losses for all entities as follows: Public business entities that meet the definition of a SEC filer, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. All other entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application continues to be allowed. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

b)ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (Hedging). The effective dates for Hedging after applying this ASU are as follows: Public business

entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. All other entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early application continues to be allowed.The Company adopted the amendments, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract". This standard aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The standard is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period, for all entities. The amendments in this ASU should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company adopted the amendments, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, "Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General (Subtopic 715-20)", which modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The amendments are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020 for public business entities and for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2021 for all other entities. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. The Company adopted the amendments, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, "Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment", which removes the second step of the goodwill impairment test that requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The Company adopted the amendments in this update as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year 2021, and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments", which changes the impairment model for most financial assets. The new model uses a forward-looking expected loss method, which will generally result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, "Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments- Credit Losses", which clarifies that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses. Instead, impairment of receivables arising from operating leases should be accounted for in accordance with Topic 842, Leases. These ASUs are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, and for other entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Earlier application is permitted. As noted above, the effective date of this ASU has now been delayed for two years by the issuance of ASU 2019-10. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases", which was further clarified by ASU 2018-10, "Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases", and ASU 2018-11, "Leases-Targeted Improvements", both issued in July 2018. ASU 2016-02 affects all entities that lease assets and will require lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases (except for short-term leases that have a duration of less than one year) as of the date on which the lessor makes the underlying asset available to the lessee. For lessors, accounting for leases is substantially the same as in prior periods. ASU 2018-10 clarifies or corrects unintended application of guidance related to ASU 2016-02. The amendment affects narrow aspects of ASU 2016-02 related to the implicit rate in the lease, impairment of the net investment in the lease, lessee reassessment of lease classification, lessor reassessment of lease term and purchase options, variable payments that depend on an index or rate and certain transition adjustments. ASU 2018-11 adds a transition option for all entities and a practical expedient only for lessors. The transition option allows entities to not apply the new lease standard in the comparative periods they present in their financial statements in the year of adoption. Under the transition option, entities can opt to continue to apply the legacy guidance in ASC 840, "Leases", including its disclosure requirements, in the comparative prior periods presented in the year they adopt the new lease standard. Entities that elect this transition option will still be

required to adopt the new leases standard using the modified retrospective transition method required by the standard, but they will recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption rather than in the earliest period presented. The new standards are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years for a public business entity. For all other entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Earlier application is permitted. As noted above, the effective date of this ASU has now been delayed for two years by the issuance of ASU 2020-05.

5. BUSINESS COMBINATION

Acquisition of mGage

On June 1, 2021, the Company completed its Merger with Vivial and the resulting acquisition of the business owned by Vivial known as mGage, a leading global mobile messaging provider. The acquisition of mGage provided an opportunity for the Company to expand its network operator connections and become one of only four companies providing direct connectivity to all tier-1 US carriers.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated as of February 18, 2021, by and among the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Volcano Merger Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), Vivial and GSO Special Situations Master Fund LP, solely in its capacity as the Stockholder Representative, Vivial was merged with and into Merger Sub, with Vivial surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The name of Vivial was changed to mGage Group Holdings, Inc. ("mGage Group Holdings") as a result of the Merger. Subsequently, on July 1, 2021, mGage Group Holdings changed its name to Kaleyra US Inc.

The Merger consideration consisted of cash consideration and common stock consideration and was subject to post-closing price adjustments as set forth in the Merger Agreement. On August 30, 2021, the Company prepared and delivered to the Stockholder Representative a written statement (the "Post-Closing Statement") setting forth the calculation of closing cash and closing net working capital which ultimately resulted in the final Merger consideration to be equal to $217.0 million pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The original cash consideration amounted to $199.2 million of which $198.6 million was paid on June 1, 2021 and the remaining amount was settled through the period ended September 30, 2021, including a working capital adjustment of $997,000. The common stock consideration was paid with the issuance to Vivial's former equity holders of a total of 1,600,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock (the "Parent Common Stock"). The resulting amount, which was based upon the $11.77 per share closing price of Parent Common Stock as of June 1, 2021, was equal to $18.8 million and has been recognized as part of the consideration transferred.

The Merger was financed through (i) the proceeds from the issuance and sale by the Company, of an aggregate of 8,400,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock to PIPE Investors at $12.50 per share, pursuant to the subscription agreements dated February 18, 2021; and (ii) the proceeds from the issuance in a private placement, of $200 million aggregate principal amount of Merger Convertible Notes to certain institutional investors. See Note 11 - Notes Payable for additional details on the Merger Convertible Notes.

The Merger was accounted for as a business combination and the total fair value of the consideration transferred of $217.0 million was allocated on a preliminary basis to the net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date and the excess was recorded as goodwill. The Company will continue to evaluate certain assets, liabilities and tax estimates that are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). During the quarter ended September 30, 2021, Kaleyra redetermined the estimated fair value of certain identified finite-lived intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and the resulting residual goodwill. The measurement period adjustment was recognized through a decrease of $8.9 million in the quarterly condensed consolidated balance sheet line item "Intangible assets, net" mostly relating the acquired developed technology, a net decrease of $1.9 million in the quarterly condensed consolidated balance sheet line item "Deferred tax liability" and an increase of $5.9 million in the quarterly condensed consolidated balance sheet line item "Goodwill". The measurement period adjustment also included a working capital adjustment of $997,000 as of September 30, 2021. No other measurement period adjustments have been recognized. The acquired entity's results of operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company from the date of acquisition.

The following table summarizes the fair value amount recognized for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date (in thousands):

Customer relationships (1)                     $ 76,256

(1)

Identified finite-lived intangible assets. The estimated fair value of the intangible assets acquired was determined by the Company, which considered or relied in part upon a valuation report of a third-party expert. The Company used income approaches to estimate the fair values of the identifiable intangible assets. The estimated useful life is 7 to 9 years for customer relationships, 6 years for developed technology and 8 years for trade names.

(2)

Goodwill is the excess of fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and represents expected synergies of the combination of the acquired business. Goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.

In 2021, the Company incurred costs related to this acquisition of $5.5 million that were expensed in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

The contribution of mGage to the consolidated revenue and consolidated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $82.0 million, and net income of $3.7 million.

Acquisition of Bandyer

On July 8, 2021, Kaleyra completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of Bandyer, a company based in Italy that offers cloud based audio/video communications services to Italian financial institutions, retail companies, utilities, insurance, human resources and digital healthcare organizations (the "Bandyer Acquisition"). Bandyer's services are extremely suitable for different industries and completely compatible with any device and expand and complete Kaleyra's already wide offering of communication channels.

The consideration for the Bandyer Acquisition consisted of cash consideration of $15.4 million (€13 million) of which $13.3 million (€11.5 million) was paid at the acquisition date and the remaining amount was retained in an escrow account. The above purchase consideration may be increased or decreased by an amount equal to the sum of the acquisition date net debt and the portion of the acquisition date net working capital that will be collected by December 31, 2021 (the "Price Adjustment"). The Price Adjustment has not been considered in the calculation of the provisional goodwill. The acquisition of Bandyer was financed through the available financial resources of Kaleyra.

The Bandyer Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the total fair value of the consideration transferred of $15.4 million was allocated on a preliminary basis to the net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date and the excess was recorded as goodwill. The Company will continue to evaluate certain assets, liabilities and tax estimates that are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The acquired entity's results of operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements of Kaleyra from the date of acquisition.

On February 23, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the existing unsecured loan agreement with Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. (the "Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. - Line 1") and an amendment to the existing unsecured loan agreement with Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. (the "Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. - Line 2"). The amendments each provide that certain financial covenants be amended, in particular as they relate to the previously agreed net financial position/equity ratio and the net financial position/gross operating income ratio. Upon the approval of the audited statutory financial statements of Kaleyra S.p.A. for the year ended December 31, 2020 in June 2021, the calculated net financial position/gross operating income ratio failed to comply with the amended terms of the unsecured loan agreement with Intesa San Paolo S.p.A. As a result of such failure, Intesa San Paolo S.p.A. was entitled to raise the interest rate bearing on the existing financing agreements of Intesa San Paolo S.p.A. by fifty (50) bps. No principal amount was subject to early reimbursement under the amended terms of the loan agreement. On August 3, 2021, the Company was notified by Intesa San Paolo S.p.A. of their resolution to apply the incremental fifty (50) bps to the interest rate bearing on future payments of interest.

On March 9, 2021 and March 10, 2021, respectively, Kaleyra S.p.A. received the approval by UniCredit to postpone repayment of the principal amounts due under the existing Line A Tranche (2), Line B and Line C of the long-term financing agreements with UniCredit S.p.A. for a period of six (6) months starting from March 1, 2021 until August 31, 2021, and under Line A Tranche (1) of the long-term financing agreement with UniCredit S.p.A. starting from February 1, 2021 until July 31, 2021. Consequently, the repayment schedule under all financing agreements mentioned above was extended for the period equal to that of the six (6) month suspension period. Following the suspension period all principal amounts due under the financing agreements mentioned above were paid according to their original repayment schedule.

On April 15, 2021, Kaleyra S.p.A. and Banco Popolare di Milano S.p.A. entered into an agreement to postpone repayment of the principal amounts due under the existing Line 3 of the long-term unsecured financing agreement for a period of six (6) months starting from March 31, 2021 until September 30, 2021, without prejudice

toKaleyraS.p.A.'sobligations to continue to pay interest in relation to the principal amount at the original due dates.Following the suspension period all principal amounts due under the existing Line 3 financing agreement were paid according to their original repayment schedule.

On April 15, 2021, the Company entered into a general unsecured loan agreement with Simest S.p.A for a total of $3.6 million (€3.0 million at the April 15, 2021 exchange rate) relating to the Fund 394/81 (the "Simest Financing") and Fund for Integrated Promotion (the "Co-financing") for implementation of a program to break into foreign markets. The principal amount of $505,000 (€422,000 at the April 15, 2021 exchange rate) of the financing applies to the Co-financing and was granted in accordance with Section 3.1 of the Temporary Framework for State aid measures to support the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak of the European Commission, and as such is non-refundable as long as the funds are used for the purposes stated within the Framework.

The principal amount of $3.1 million (€2.6 million at the April 15, 2021 exchange rate) applies to the Simest Financing. The Simest Financing bears a subsidized interest rate of 0.055% and a reference interest rate of 0.55%. The loan will have a duration of six (6) years starting from the date of disbursement and will have to be repaid in half-yearly installments starting after a two-year pre-amortization period.

On September 15, 2021, the principal amount of $1.3 million (€1.1 million at the September 15, 2021 exchange rate) and $208,000 (€176,000 at the September 15, 2021 exchange rate) relating to the first installment of the Simest Financing and Co-financing, respectively, was disbursed to the Company pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement with Simest S.p.A.

As of December 31, 2021, all of the available long-term facilities were drawn in full except for the Simest Financing as described above.

The above facilities include a series of statements and disclosure obligations, in line with the standard practice for these types of financings, whose breach could result in termination, early repayment or enforcement of acceleration rights. In particular, the UniCredit Facility and the Intesa Sanpaolo Facility include, among other, change of control provisions that may cause the bank to request immediate repayment of the outstanding debt under the relevant facility as a result of such a change of control event. Upon the consummation of the Merger Agreement, Kaleyra S.p.A. formally agreed with UniCredit S.p.A. and Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. that the Merger Agreement does not represent a change of control event with respect to the respective outstanding borrowing.

In addition, some of the above facilities require compliance with certain financial covenants, based on Kaleyra S.p.A.'s EBITDA, net financial position and equity, calculated upon the approved audited statutory financial statements of Kaleyra S.p.A.. Failure to comply with those financial covenants may result in the repayment of the outstanding debt under the relevant facility or the increase in the interest rate bearing on the existing financing agreements. As of December 31, 2021, the Company is in compliance with all the financial covenants.

Interest expense on bank and other borrowings was of $702,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $835,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company is obliged to make payments as follows (in thousands):

The Non-convertible Notes held by Esse Effe and Maya were paid in full during fiscal year 2020 and no amount remains outstanding for such notes as of December 31, 2021.

Business Combination Convertible Notes

As of December 31, 2021, the Business Combination Convertible Notes held by Esse Effe and Maya amounted to zero.

The Business Combination Convertible Notes are classified as "Notes payable due to related parties" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The accrued interest payable is included in "Other current liabilities" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

On the fifteen-month anniversary of the Business Combination date or February 25, 2021, the fifty percent (50%) of the previously outstanding amount of Business Combination Convertible Notes held by Esse Effe and Maya was repaid, with a total of $3.0 million and $750,000 in principal and $176,000 and $44,000 in accrued interest being paid to Esse Effe and Maya, respectively, pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Convertible Notes.

Notes payable - Other

On April 16, 2020, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release (the "Settlement Agreement") with its Business Combination financial advisory service firms, Cowen and Company, LLC ("Cowen") and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, ("Chardan" and collectively the "Service Firms"), pursuant to which it agreed to pay an affiliate of Cowen, Cowen Investments II LLC ("Cowen Investments"), and Chardan, in full satisfaction of

all amounts owed to the Service Firms as of December 31, 2019, $5.4million in the aggregate, as follows: (i) $2.7million in the aggregate in common stock of the Company (the "Settlement Shares") to be issued the business day prior to the filing of a resale registration statement for such Settlement Shares (the "Bank Resale Registration Statement"), (ii) convertible notes totaling $2.7million in the aggregate with a maturity datethree yearsafter issuance and bearing interest at five percent (5%) per annum (but with lower interest rates if the notes are repaid earlier thanone yearortwo yearsafter issuance) and with interest paid in arrears to the payee on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, with such convertible notes to also be issued the business day prior to the filing of the Resale Registration Statement and (iii) in the event that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below) would otherwise be exceeded upon delivery of the Settlement Shares above, a warrant agreement also to be entered into with and issued to the Services Firms the business day prior to the filing of the Resale Registration Statement, whereby the amount of common stock of the Company by which the Beneficial Ownership Limitation would otherwise have been exceeded upon delivery of the Settlement Shares will be substituted for by warrants with an exercise price of $0.01per share issued pursuant to a Warrant Agreement (the "Warrant Agreement") and the common stock underlying the Warrant Agreement (the "Warrant Shares"). The Beneficial Ownership Limitation shall initially be4.99% of the number of shares of the common stock outstanding of the Company immediately after giving effect to the issuance of these shares of common stock. The number of Settlement Shares was calculated using as the price per Settlement Share an amount equal to a fifteen percent (15%) discount to the ten-day (10-day) trailing dollar volume-weighted average price for the common stock of the Company on the NYSE American LLC stock exchange (the "VWAP") on the business day immediately prior to the date on which the Company filed the Resale Registration Statement. In addition, the price per share for determining the number of shares of common stock of the Company to be issued upon the conversion of the convertible notes shall be a five percent (5%) premium to the ten-day (10-day) trailing VWAP as of the date immediately prior to the issuance date of the convertible notes, rounded down to the nearest whole number.

On May 1, 2020, in connection with the Settlement Agreement, the Company issued: (i) an aggregate of 440,595 Settlement Shares to Cowen Investments and Chardan, consisting of 374,506 Settlement Shares issued to Cowen Investments, and 66,089 Settlement Shares issued to Chardan, which resulted in a $0.2 million loss on settlement on the issuance date of May 1, 2020; and (ii) convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2.7 million to Cowen Investments and Chardan, consisting of a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $2.3 million issued to Cowen Investments (the "Cowen Note") and a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $405,000 issued to Chardan (the "Chardan Note"). The unpaid principal of the Cowen Note was convertible at the option of Cowen Investments into 303,171 shares of common stock of the Company, if there has been no principal reduction, and the unpaid principal of the Chardan Note is convertible at the option of Chardan into 53,501 shares of common stock of the Company, if there has been no principal reduction. As the Beneficial Ownership Limitation was not triggered by the issuance of the Settlement Shares, no Warrant Agreement was necessary and no warrants were issued.

As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding amount of the Cowen Note was $2.3 million and accrued interest was $63,000. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding amount of the Chardan Note was $405,000 and accrued interest was $14,000.

On February 4, 2021, Cowen Investments elected to convert the outstanding amount of the Cowen Note into 303,171 shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the Cowen Note, and as a result the Company has no further obligations with respect to the Cowen Note.

As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding amount of the Chardan Note was $405,000 and accrued interest was $34,000. This note payable is included in "Long-term portion of notes payable" and the accrued interest payable is included in "Other current liabilities" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

On June 1, 2021, the Company issued the Merger Convertible Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $200 million. The Company incurred $11.4 million of issuance costs as a result of the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notes.

Association, a national banking association, in its capacity as trustee thereunder (the "Indenture Trustee"), in respect of the $200million of Merger Convertible Notes that were issued to the Convertible Note Investors.

The Merger Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.125% per annum, payable semi-annually, in arrears on each June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2021, to holders of record at the close of business on the preceding May 15 and November 15, respectively. The Merger Convertible Notes are convertible into 11,851,852 shares of Parent Common Stock at a conversion price of $16.875 per share of Parent Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, and mature five years after their issuance. The Company may, at its election, force conversion of the Merger Convertible Notes after (i) the first anniversary of the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notes, subject to a holder's prior right to convert, if the last reported sale price of the Parent Common Stock exceeds 150% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter and (ii) the second anniversary of the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notes, subject to a holder's prior right to convert, if the last reported sale price of the Parent Common Stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. Following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if the Company forces a mandatory conversion, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Merger Convertible Notes in connection with such a corporate event or has its Merger Convertible Notes mandatorily converted, as the case may be. In addition, in the event that a holder of the Merger Convertible Notes elects to convert its Merger Convertible Notes prior to the third anniversary of the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notes, the Company will be obligated to pay an amount equal to twelve months of interest, or if on or after such third anniversary of the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notes, any remaining amounts that would be owed to, but excluding, the fourth anniversary of the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notes (the "Interest Make-Whole Payment"). The Interest Make-Whole Payment will be payable in cash or shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in the Indenture.

Upon the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notes, management made the assessment whether the convertible instrument contained embedded conversion features for bifurcation and concluded that such embedded conversion features met the definition of a derivative but qualified for the scope exception under ASC 815-10-15-74(a) as they are indexed to the Company's stock and qualify for classification within stockholders' equity. Management determined that the Interest Make-Whole Payment met the definition of a derivative, but the value was de minimis and as such no amount was recorded at the time of the issuance of the Merger Convertible Notes. Management will continue to monitor the valuation of the Interest Make-Whole Payment provision and assess the need to record a liability in future periods.

As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding amount of the Merger Convertible Notes was $189.7 million, net of issuance costs. During the year ended December 31, 2021, contractual interest expense on the Merger Convertible Notes amounted to $7.1 million and amortization of the debt issuance costs amounted to $1.1 million. The liability is included in the consolidated balance sheet line item "Long-term portion of notes payable" and the interest expense is included in "Financial expense, net" on the consolidated statements of operations.

12. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATION

The Company sponsors two defined benefit plans covering the majority of Italian employees and all of Solutions Infini's employees. Total costs of the defined benefit plans for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $635,000 and $465,000, respectively.

Rate of compensation increase for Solutions Infini 17.00% 20.00%
(1)

The discount rate for Kaleyra S.p.A. is based on the Euro area composite yields AA with a duration equal to the estimated term of the obligations at the balance sheet date.

(2)

The discount rate for Solutions Infini is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian government securities at the balance sheet date for the estimated term of the obligations.

The Company also has a 401(k) defined contribution plan ("401(k) plan") covering substantially all U.S. domestic employees. The participation in this plan is voluntary. The Company matches plan participants' contributions up to various limits. Participants' contributions are limited based on their compensation and, for certain supplemental contributions which are not eligible for Company matching, based on their age. Contributions for the 401(k) plan were $339,000 and $102,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively.

21. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (DEFICIT)

Common stock

The authorized common stock of the Company includes up to 100,000,000 shares. Holders of the Company's common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock. As of December 31, 2021, there were 44,831,695 shares of common stock issued and 42,033,637 shares outstanding with a par value $0.0001 per share.

On April 29, 2020, as additional consideration for the Business Combination as an earn-out, Kaleyra issued 1,763,633 shares of its common stock to the Sellers.

On June 29, 2020, the Company completed an offering relating to the issuance and sale of 7,777,778 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. In addition, on July 24, 2020, the Company issued an additional 984,916 shares of common stock upon the exercise and close of the overallotment option by the underwriters, pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement.

On June 1, 2021, Kaleyra agreed to pay to Vivial's former equity holders the common stock consideration for the acquisition of mGage business by means of the issuance of 1,600,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Further, in support of the consummation of the Merger, on June 1, 2021, Kaleyra agreed to issue and sell, in private placements to close immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, an aggregate of 8,400,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock, par value $0.0001, under the terms of the PIPE Subscriptions Agreements entered into with certain institutional investors.

Preferred Stock

The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2021, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.

22. WARRANTS

The Company's warrants are only exercisable for whole shares at $11.50 per share. Under the terms of the warrant agreement dated December 12, 2017 (the "Warrant Agreement"), the Company agreed to use its best efforts to file a new registration statement following the completion of the Business Combination, for the registration of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. That registration statement was filed by the Company on May 4, 2020 and declared effective by the SEC on May 8, 2020. No fractional shares are issuable upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, the Company will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number for the number of shares of common stock to be issued to the warrant holder. Each warrant became exercisable 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination and will expire five years after the completion of the Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Once the warrants became exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants in whole and not in part at a price of $0.01 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days' prior written notice of redemption, only in the event that the last sale price of the Company's shares of common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within the 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.

On April 12, 2021, the SEC issued a SEC Staff Statement on "Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies ("SPACs") (the "SEC Staff Statement"). The SEC Staff Statement addresses certain accounting and reporting considerations related to warrants of a kind similar to those issued by the Company at the time of its initial public offering in December 2019. Based on ASC 815-40, "Contracts in Entity's Own Equity", warrant instruments that do not meet the criteria to be considered indexed to an entity's own stock shall be initially classified as liabilities at their estimated fair values. In periods subsequent to issuance, changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative instruments should be reported in the consolidated statements of operations. Following the SEC Staff Statement, management evaluated the fact pattern set forth within the Company's Warrant Agreement and concluded that the warrants issued in connection with private placements that occurred in December 2017 and January 2018 concurrently with its initial public offering (the "Private Placement Warrants") should have been recorded as a liability at fair value as the Private Placement Warrants were not considered to be indexed to the entity's own stock. Because the transfer of Private Placement Warrants to anyone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees would result in the Private Placement Warrants having substantially the same terms as warrants issued in the Company's initial public offering, management determined that the fair value of each Private Placement Warrant approximates the fair value of its publicly traded warrants.

Management analyzed the impact of this error on the Company's prior consolidated financial statements beginning from the date when the Private Placement Warrants were issued and concluded that the adjustments were immaterial to any period presented in previously issued consolidated financial statements. The out-of-period adjustment related to the prior periods was also immaterial to the three months ended March 31, 2021. As a result of this analysis, the Company corrected this error in the three months ended March 31, 2021.

The correction resulted in an increase of $534,000 in other long-term liabilities, a decrease of $344,000 in additional paid-in capital and an increase of $190,000 in financial income (expense), net for the quarter ended March 31, 2021.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company has federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards totaling $157.9 million, $177.8 million and $5.4 million, respectively. If not utilized, federal net operating losses of $78.7 million will expire at various dates from 2026 through 2037, and $79.2 million have an indefinite life. State net operating losses of $168.9 million will expire at various dates from 2023 through 2041, and $8.9 million have an indefinite life. Foreign net operating losses will expire at various dates from 2023 through 2027.

With the exception of post acquisition losses occurring after May 31, 2021, domestic net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation as a result of the Kaleyra US Inc., f/k/a mGage, acquisition and Kaleyra Inc. equity offerings that resulted in multiple changes of ownership as defined under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382. Kaleyra US Inc. accounts for $31.1 million IRC Section 163(j) deferred interest tax attribute that is subject to IRC §382 limitation. IRC §163(j) has an indefinite life, and generally limited to an annual deduction of thirty percent of taxable income and to the extent of business interest income. California net operating loss deductions are limited to a member's contribution to combined California taxable income. The fair market values assigned to the domestic entities exceed the effected tax attributes. The Company's net operating losses are not expected to expire as result of any IRC §382 limitation.

The Company's accounting for deferred taxes involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of its net deferred tax assets. The Company primarily considered such factors as its history of operating losses, the nature of the Company's deferred tax assets, and the timing, likelihood and amount, if any, of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences and carryforwards become deductible. The Company does not believe that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized; accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established for the amount of the deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforward, startup costs, deferred interest expense, stock based compensation and other deferred tax assets in excess of the deferred tax liabilities that will reverse prior to any net operating loss carryforward expiration date and deferred tax assets that are not available to be recognized to reduce future income.

As of December 31, 2020, a $305,000 valuation allowance existed against Solutions Infini's $1.2 million gross deferred tax asset balance. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a $305,000 full-year valuation allowance release related to the Indian tax jurisdiction, partially offset by an increase to the Italian valuation allowance of $584,000, on the basis of management's reassessment of the amount of its deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.

Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, if we identify changes to acquired deferred tax asset valuation allowances or liabilities related to uncertain tax positions during the measurement period, and they are related to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, those changes are considered a measurement-period adjustment, and we record the offset to goodwill. We record all other changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in current-period income tax expense. This accounting applies to all of our acquisitions, regardless of acquisition date.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to an underpayment of income taxes in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company has accumulated $65,000 and $60,000 in interest expense, respectively.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows (in thousands):

                                                                   As of December 31,

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $4.3 million of undistributed earnings and profits generated by a foreign subsidiary (Solutions Infini FZE) for which deferred tax liabilities have been recorded. Should the above undistributed earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, the distributions would result in $642,000 withholding tax.

The Company files income tax returns in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions including Italy, Germany, United Kingdom and India. As of December 31, 2021, the tax years 2007 through the current period remain open to examination in each of the major jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to tax.

On March 27, 2020, the United States enacted the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, permits net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to offset 100% of taxable income for taxable years beginning before 2021. In addition, the CARES Act allows net operating losses incurred in 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. The Company filed an NOL carryback to recover $959,000 prior paid taxes. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 was signed into law and extends several CARES Act provisions. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has determined that neither this Act nor changes to income tax laws or regulations in other jurisdictions is expected to have a significant impact on our effective tax rate.

In the second quarter of 2021, the Company benefited from the measures introduced in Italy by the art. 110 of the Law Decree n. 104/2020, converted in the Law n. 126/2020, enacting "Urgent measures to support and relaunch the economy", which reopened the voluntary step up of tangible and intangible assets, with the application of a substitute tax at a rate of three percent. In particular, Kaleyra S.p.A. benefited from the one-time partial step-up of its trademark for tax purposes of $24.3 million, which resulted in the recognition in 2021 of deferred tax assets for $5.8 million and a substitute tax liability for approximately $730,000, which was full offset by an increase to Kaleyra S.p.A.'s valuation allowance. Budget Law n.234 issued on December 31, 2021, extended the amortization period from eighteen to fifty years retroactively to all elections. The Company's first installment payment for approximately $260,000 was paid in August 2021.

25. NET LOSS PER SHARE

The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted loss per common share during the period presented (in thousands, except share and per share data):

                                                                                     Year Ended December 31,

The Company generated a net loss attributable to the Company's common stockholders for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Accordingly, the effect of dilutive securities is not considered in the net loss per share for such periods because their effect would be anti-dilutive on the net loss per share.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock equivalents, which were excluded from the calculation of the diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as their effect would be anti-dilutive, was 11,053,873 (15,275,403 for the year ended December 31, 2020).

From time to time, Kaleyra may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. Kaleyra is not currently involved in any material legal proceedings as a defendant.

On October 17, 2018, Kaleyra filed a claim against Vodafone Italia S.p.A. ("Vodafone") before the Court of Milan seeking compensation in the amount of €6.1 million ($6.9 million at the December 31, 2021 exchange rate) for all the damages suffered as a consequence of the illicit and anticompetitive conduct of Vodafone, as previously determined by the Italian Antitrust Authority (namely, Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato or AGCM) in their decisions issued on December 13, 2017; Vodafone has appealed that sanctioning resolution before the Italian Regional Administrative Court.

The deadline for filing a counterclaim by Vodafone has passed and according to Italian Law, Vodafone is no longer entitled to file a counterclaim against Kaleyra in these proceedings. Both Kaleyra and Vodafone have filed their final pleadings on October 1, 2019 and October 21, 2019.

The Court of Milan has decided to suspend the procedure, through order no. 1570 on May 18, 2020. The decision of the Court of Milan is based on procedural reasons only (concerning the unprecedented definition of the relationship between administrative and civil proceedings in the case at hand) and does not analyze or take into any consideration the merits of the action brought by Kaleyra. The procedural suspension ordered by the Court of Milan shall last until the appeal brought by Vodafone before the Italian Regional Administrative Court against the decision of the Italian Antitrust Authority (the "ICA") is concluded with a definitive judgment. Accordingly, following the order of suspension issued by the Civil Court of Milan, on August 10, 2020, Kaleyra filed a request to speed up the scheduling of the hearing in relation to the pending appeal before the Italian Regional Administrative Court brought by Vodafone Italia. The Court upheld Kaleyra's request and the hearing took place on February 24, 2021. Accordingly, the parties submitted their final defenses. On September 15, 2021, the Administrative Court issued its first instance decision that upheld Vodafone's appeal and annulled the sanctioning resolution issued by the Italian Competition Authority (decision no. 9803/2021). On December 10, 2021, the ICA filed its appeal to the second instance Court (Council of State) against the Administrative Court first instance decision no. 9803/2021 asking to overrule it.Both Vodafone and Kaleyra submitted their appearances in the judicial proceeding, but no hearing has been scheduled yet by the Council of State.Until a final decision is reached by the Council of State there will be no effect on the civil proceeding that will therefore remain suspended.

The outcome of such action cannot be determined at this time. Therefore, no recognition of these actions has been made in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

On April 16, 2019, Kaleyra filed a claim against Telecom Italia S.p.A. ("Telecom") and Telecom Italia Sparkle S.p.A. ("Sparkle", jointly with Telecom "Defendants") before the Court of Milan seeking compensation in the amount of €8.3 million ($10.2 million at the December 31, 2020 exchange rate) for damages suffered after the illicit conduct of both counterparts, determined by the Italian Antitrust Authority in the decision issued on December 13, 2017.

At the first hearing before the Court of Milan held for the appearance of the parties on December 11, 2019, the judge reserved the decision on the possible suspension of the case in consideration of the appeal brought by Telecom

Italia S.p.A and Telecom Italia Sparkle S.p.A. against the Italian Antitrust Authority's decision of December 13,2017before the Regional Administrative Court, which is currently pending.

By order issued on December 14, 2019, the judge released his reserve and referred the issue concerning the relation between the assessment of the pending administrative case and the one to be carried out in the civil case to a panel composed of three judges. The case was therefore adjourned for a hearing on April 29, 2020 where the parties had to file their final pleadings.

On April 9, 2020, following the measures taken by the Italian legislator for the Covid-19 pandemic, the above-mentioned hearing was postponed to and then held on October 7, 2020. At the hearing of October 7, 2020, the parties exposed their closing arguments and the decision on the preliminary question as to the suspension of the civil proceedings has been reserved to a panel composed of three judges. The parties also submitted written observations concerning the preliminary question.

On January 7, 2021, the Court issued an order by which the civil proceedings have been suspended until the decision in the pending administrative case - which was deemed to be prejudicial to the civil one - becomes final (i.e., it is no longer subject to appeal). The order was communicated to the parties via certified electronic mail on January 11, 2021.

In light of the average duration of cases before the Italian Administrative Courts and the Defendants' interest in both having the Italian Competition Authority's decision annulled and procrastinating the administrative case (on which the civil proceedings now depend pursuant to the above-mentioned order) for dilatory purposes, the civil case is unlikely to proceed in the short term. In order to speed up the administrative proceedings (and thus the civil case), on February 9, 2021, Kaleyra filed an application with the Administrative Court of Latium requesting that the hearing on the merits of the case be held as soon as possible ("istanza di prelievo"). On September 23, 2021, the Defendants filed with the Administrative Court of Latium their "istanza di prelievo" aimed at requesting a prompt schedule of the hearing on the merits of the case. The request is motivated taking into consideration, inter alia, the decision, dated September 15, 2021, by which - in a parallel case - the same Administrative Court annulled the decision by which the Italian Competition Authority (decision no. 9803/2021) ascertained that Vodafone Italia S.p.A. committed an abuse of a dominant position in violation of art. 102 TFEU for margin squeeze (i.e., for behaviors similar to those attributed to the Defendants in the decision). The hearing has been scheduled on March 23, 2022.

Also, in light of the above, the outcome of Kaleyra's civil action nor its duration is predictable at this time.

The outcome of such civil action cannot be determined at this time. Therefore, no recognition of these actions has been made in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

In addition to the above, Kaleyra has appealed the resolutions issued by the Italian Communications Authority (namely, Autorità per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni or AGCom) concerning their request for the annual fee to AGCom for years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

The first instance proceeding against AGCom's resolutions for the 2016 contribution was successful for Kaleyra and the Italian Regional Administrative Court annulled the resolutions Kaleyra had appealed (judgement no. 2161/2019). However, AGCom filed its second instance appeal before the Council of State seeking the overruling of the Court's decision. The appeal has been regularly discussed at the hearing of September 17, 2020 and the Council of State issued its decision number 6175/2020 on October 13, 2020, overruling in part the Regional Court decision. AGCom will have to recalculate the annual contribution due from Kaleyra for year 2016. However, the annual contribution is not considered material to Kaleyra's consolidated financial statements.

For the annual contribution to AGCom relating the years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 the legal proceedings are currently pending before the Italian Regional Administrative Court and no hearing has been scheduled yet. However, the European Court of Justice ("ECJ") has already delivered its decision on the request for a preliminary ruling submitted by the Council of State on the relevant EU law (case C-399/18). Such decision was delivered on April 29, 2020, in accordance with a simplified procedure due to the previous issuance by the ECJ of a number of judgements on the matter.

Finally, Kaleyra took part in two appeals brought before the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio (TAR Lazio) by, respectively, an Association of Content Service Providers ("CSP") for Value Added Services on mobile network ("VAS"), and one singular CSP, against a specific resolution of the Italian Communications Authority regarding the rules for applying a barring mechanism on the SIM of the final users of VAS (resolution no.

10/21/CONS).Kaleyrafiled its interventions in both the judicial proceedings to support the measures issued byAGCom.

Specifically, following the hearing before TAR Lazio that took place on March 17, 2021, the Court has issued two orders (no. 1748 and no. 1751, dated March 18, 2021) that rejected the precautionary measures requested by both the plaintiffs, upholding the position represented by Kaleyra to support the legitimacy of the abovementioned resolution. Following the definition of the precautionary phase, both appeals are likely to be discussed on the merits in the next months. As of today, TAR Lazio has not scheduled any further hearing, hence there is no imminent deadline with regard to those judicial proceedings. For the sake of completeness, the final judgments of TAR Lazio on the two appeals above shall not result in any economic direct impact on Kaleyra.

28. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On January 13, 2022, Kaleyra completed a company reorganization of the acquired business of Bandyer by means of the merger of the Italian legal entity of Bandyer into the holding company, Kaleyra S.p.A.. As a result of the merger, Bandyer ceased to exist as a separate legal entity and all its assets and liabilities have been incorporated under Kaleyra S.p.A. effective January 13, 2022.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2021.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Kaleyra completed the Business Combination on November 25, 2019. Prior to the Business Combination, Kaleyra was a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. As a result, previously existing internal controls were no longer applicable or comprehensive enough since Kaleyra's operations before the Business Combination were insignificant compared to those of the consolidated entity after the Business Combination. Kaleyra's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The design of Kaleyra's internal control over financial reporting after the Business Combination required significant time and resources from management and other personnel during fiscal year 2020 and ultimately resulted in the effective implementation of Kaleyra's framework for implementation and evaluation of internal control over financial reporting enabling management to perform and conclude upon the assessment of Kaleyra's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.

Following the fiscal year 2020 effective evaluation of internal control and further improvements resulting therein, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and our CFO and oversight of the board of directors, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the criteria set forth in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. In accordance with applicable guidance from the SEC for acquisitions, the scope of management's evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the acquired businesses of mGage and Bandyer because those acquisitions were completed on June 1, 2021 and July 8, 2021, respectively. Total assets and revenues of mGage represented 17.9% and 30.6% of our total assets and total revenues, respectively, as reported in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021. Total assets and revenues of Bandyer represented 0.6% and 0.4% of our total assets and total revenues, respectively, as reported in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

As of December 31, 2020, Kaleyra completed the design of its framework for implementation and evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for Kaleyra after the Business Combination in a manner commensurate with the scale of Kaleyra's operations. During fiscal year 2021, following the implementation of Kaleyra's new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, there have been the following main changes in the internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Kaleyra's internal control over financial reporting:

• Implementation of system-based approval workflows that are likely to enable streamlined review and approval protocols over journal entries;

• Implementation of system-assisted account reconciliation controls designed to improve the timeliness, completeness and accuracy of closing the book activities; and

• Implementation of new controls designed to ensure the completeness and accuracy of purchase price accounting in the context of business combinations.

On June 1, 2021, the Merger was consummated between Kaleyra and mGage. As a result of the Merger, the internal control over financial reporting of Kaleyra prior to the Merger will become the internal control over financial reporting of mGage. During the quarter ended December 31, 2021, Kaleyra started to evaluate the integration of its internal control over financial reporting with the internal control of mGage.

On July 8, 2021, Kaleyra completed the acquisition of Bandyer. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, Kaleyra completed the merger of the Italian legal entity of Bandyer into the holding company, Kaleyra S.p.A.. As a result of the acquisition and the subsequent merger, the internal control over financial reporting of Kaleyra prior to the acquisition and the subsequent merger became the internal control over financial reporting of the acquired and subsequently merged business of Bandyer.

The above changes in the internal control over financial reporting of Kaleyra are part of the Company's further improved framework for implementation and evaluation of internal control over financial reporting.

Number, Terms of Office and Election of Executive Officers and Directors

Although our Board is authorized to have seven directors, it is currently comprised of six directors, all of whom have been voted upon by our stockholders. Our two Class I directors were re-elected at the annual meeting held in 2020 and our two Class II directors were re-elected at the annual meeting held in 2021. There is a vacancy for a seventh director that our Board may in the future act with regard to filling when a suitable candidate is identified.

Our Board believes it is in the best interests of Kaleyra for the Board to be classified into three classes, each comprising as nearly as possible one-third of the directors to serve three-year terms. Each Class I director, consisting of Messrs.

Our executive officers are elected by our Board and serve at the discretion of the Board, rather than for specific terms of office. Our Board is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our bylaws provide that our executive officers may consist of a Chief Executive Officer, a President, a Chief Financial Officer, Vice Presidents, a Secretary, Assistant Secretaries, a Treasurer and such other offices as may be determined by the Board.

Code of Ethics

We have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our management team and employees in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. You are able to review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov[http://www.sec.gov]. In addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us, or may be accessed on our company website at https://investors.kaleyra.com/[https://investors.kaleyra.com/]. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K.

Our Board has adopted a written charter for each of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each charter is available on our website at https://investors.kaleyra.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents[https://investors.kaleyra.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents].

Corporate Governance Guidelines

We have adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that address the composition of the board, criteria for board membership and other board governance matters. These guidelines are available on our website at https://investors.kaleyra.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents[https://investors.kaleyra.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents].

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance - Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports

Section 16(a) of the Exchange requires our management team and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our common stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. These reporting persons are also required to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely upon a review of such forms, we believe that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, there was one delinquent filer. The distributions made by each of GigAcquisitions, LLC and GigFounders, LLC on December 1, 2020, for which Neil Miotto was deemed a beneficial owner, were not made by Mr. Miotto until July 2, 2021. They were timely made by Dr. Avi Katz, who was deemed the other beneficial owner of GigAcquisitions, LLC and GigFounders, LLC.

Item 11. Executive Compensation.

Compensation Philosophy and Objectives

Kaleyra has developed an executive compensation program that is consistent with Kaleyra's existing compensation policies and philosophies, which are designed to align compensation with its business objectives and the creation of stockholder value, while enabling Kaleyra to attract, motivate and retain individuals who contribute to its long-term success. Decisions on the executive compensation program are made by the Compensation Committee of the Board.

Decisions regarding executive compensation reflect a belief that the executive compensation program must be competitive in order to attract and retain highly competent executive officers as well as include a significant element of "pay for performance". The Compensation Committee seeks to implement these compensation policies and philosophies by linking a significant portion of Kaleyra's executive officers' cash compensation to the achievement of annual performance objectives and by providing a portion of their compensation as both annual and long-term incentive compensation in the form of equity awards. Further, the Compensation Committee seeks to tie our executive compensation levels to the compensation practices of our peer companies and the shareholder returns achieved by those peer companies by setting our relative executive compensation percentile levels comparable to the relative shareholder return percentile level achieved by Kaleyra as compared to its peer companies.

Compensation for Kaleyra's executive officers has three primary components: base salary, an annual cash incentive bonus and long-term equity-based incentive compensation.

Employment Agreements

On March 13, 2020, Kaleyra has entered into an employment agreement with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Dario Calogero. That employment agreement provides that Mr. Calogero will receive a base salary at an annual rate of $450,000, subject to increase from time to time as determined by the Board or its compensation committee, and a relocation allowance covering the period of time that Mr. Calogero is based in New York of $400,000 per year, as well as that he shall be eligible to receive an annual bonus of 100% of his base salary based upon financial and operational objectives achievable within an applicable fiscal year and long-term equity-based awards. The employment agreement with Mr. Calogero is discussed in more detail below under the caption "Employment Arrangements with Named Executive Officers." However, the base salary for Mr. Calogero as stated in the employment agreement is established based on the scope of his responsibilities, taking into account market compensation paid by comparable companies for equivalent positions.

Prior to June 2021, Kaleyra's EVP and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Giacomo Dall'Aglio did not have an employment agreement with Kaleyra. Instead, in December 2019, the Board determined that Mr. Dall'Aglio will receive a base salary at an annual rate of €250,000, subject to increase from time to time as determined by the Board or its Compensation Committee, a monthly relocation allowance covering the period of time that Mr. Dall'Aglio is based in New York at the annual rate of €175,000 (which ended on June 30, 2021), and that he is eligible to receive a bonus of 50% of his base salary based upon financial and operational objectives achievable within an applicable fiscal year as well as long-term equity-based awards. On June 2, 2021, Kaleyra entered into a formal written employment agreement with Mr. Dall'Aglio. Under the employment agreement, Mr. Dall'Aglio will receive a base salary at an annual rate of $300,000, subject to increase from time to time as determined by the Board or its Compensation Committee and he remains eligible to receive a bonus of 50% of his base salary based upon financial and operational objectives achievable within an applicable fiscal year as well as long-term equity-based awards.

On October 1, 2021, Mr. Mauro Carobene and Kaleyra S.p.A. entered into an employment agreement, in connection with his appointment as Chief Business Officer. Under the employment agreement, Mr. Carobene is to be paid an annual base salary of €240,000, subject to adjustment, and will be eligible to receive variable compensation in the form of a discretionary annual performance and target bonus, with an incentive target amount of 50% of his then-applicable annual base salary, which is subject to the achievement of certain individual performance targets and company results, which will be payable in cash, shares or other form as determined by Kaleyra S.p.A. The employment agreement can be terminated by either party at any time during the six-month probationary period and thereafter in accordance with the notice periods applicable by law. Any severance payment is payable in accordance with Article 8(8) of Legislative Decree no. 252 of December 5, 2005.

On January 14, 2020,KaleyraS.p.A and Mr. Nicola Vitto entered into an employment agreement in connection with his appointment as Chief Product& TechnologyOfficer, effective as of January 16, 2020. The employment agreement provides that Mr. Vitto is to be paid an annual base salary of €180,000,subject to adjustment,payable in 14 instalments and will be eligible to receive a discretionary annual performance and target bonus, with an incentive target amount of 50% of his then-applicable annual gross salary, to be based on the achievement of certain individual targets, as agreed with his manager, and certain company targets. In connection with the entry into his employment agreement, Mr. Vitto also received a signing bonus in the amount of €60,000, payable in two instalments at the end of the first and third month of employment. The employment agreement can be terminated in accordance with the notice periods applicable by law. Any severance payment is payable in accordance with Article 8(8) of Legislative Decree no. 252 of December 5, 2005.

On June 10, 2020, mGgage, LLC ("mGage"), which was not at the time an affiliate of Kaleyra, and Mr. Geoff Grauer entered into an employment agreement in connection with his appointment as Vice President, Operations & Security. With the acquisition of mGage by Kaleyra, this employment agreement has remained in place, except Mr. Grauer's title has changed, as has who he reports to within the Company. The employment agreement terms provide that Mr. Grauer is to be paid an annual base salary of $250,000 and be eligible to receive an annual target bonus, with an incentive target amount of 20% of his then-applicable annual base salary, to be based on the achievement of operating targets, payable at the direction of the then Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of mGage upon his determination in his sole discretion. The employment agreement terms provide for at will employment and the employment relationship may be terminated by either Mr. Grauer or mGage at any time. If Mr. Grauer's employment is terminated by mGage without cause, Mr. Grauer will be entitled to receive the following severance benefits: (A) a lump sum cash payment equal to the aggregate amount of six-months of his then-current base salary, (B) a lump sum payment equal to the company-paid COBRA premium rate for continued coverage for him and his dependents, and (C) the prorated amount of his target bonus, if any. Payment of any severance is subject to Mr. Grauer's signing a release of claims.

Furthermore, the base salaries of Kaleyra's executive officers, including its named executive officers (the "NEOs"), will be reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee to the extent recommended upon advice and counsel of its advisors, and any increases are expected to be similar in scope to Kaleyra's overall corporate salary increase, if any. For comparison purposes, Kaleyra has utilized compensation survey data from Compensia and the peer company proxy filings. Kaleyra's philosophy is to target the NEOs base salaries to be in the range between the 25th percentile up to the 75th percentile of salaries for executives in equivalent positions at comparable companies. Kaleyra believes targeting the NEOs salaries to be in the range between the 25th percentile up to the 75th percentile of salaries relative to comparable companies reflects Kaleyra's best efforts to ensure it is neither overpaying nor underpaying its NEOs.

Annual Bonuses

Kaleyra uses annual cash incentive bonuses for the NEOs to tie a portion of their compensation to financial and operational objectives and key results achievable within the applicable fiscal year. Near the beginning of each year, the Compensation Committee selects the performance targets, or Objectives and Key Results ("OKR") or other bonus performance objectives of Kaleyra, target amounts, target award opportunities and other term and conditions of annual cash bonuses for the NEOs. Following the end of each year, the Compensation Committee will determine the extent to which the OKR or other performance objectives were achieved and the amount of the award that is payable to the NEOs. In addition, on occasion, and at the sole discretion of the Board or the Compensation Committee, Kaleyra may grant special achievement bonuses to the NEOs in recognition of a special event or achievement that has significantly improved the performance, strength or nature of Kaleyra and its business.

On August 9, 2021, Kaleyra granted a special achievement bonus to Dr. Katz, Mr. Calogero and Mr. Dall'Aglio to reward these individuals for their extraordinary efforts during Kaleyra's acquisitions of both the mGage business of Vivial, Inc. and Bandyer Srl. These bonuses to each of these individuals were paid with a combination of cash and restricted stock units ("RSUs"). The Board decided to pay Messrs. Calogero and Dall'Aglio with this combination of cash and RSUs. Dr. Katz elected to have a portion of his bonus not be paid in cash and instead be issued as an RSU in the same manner as Messrs. Calogero and Dall'Aglio, including that such RSUs be subject to vesting, and the Board approved the payments as elected by Dr. Katz.

Equity-Based Awards

Kaleyra uses equity-based awards to reward long-term performance of the NEOs. Kaleyra believes that providing a meaningful portion of the total compensation package in the form of equity-based awards aligns the incentives of its NEOs with the interests of its stockholders and serves to motivate and retain the individual named executive officers. Any awards would be made in accordance with the executive compensation program discussed above. Kaleyra is currently using RSUs to encourage long term performance.

Other Compensation

Kaleyra maintains various employee benefit plans, including medical, dental, life insurance and defined benefit plans, granted to Italian and Indian employees, and 401(k) plans covering substantially all U.S. domestic employees, in which the NEOs will participate. It also provides certain perquisites to its named executive officers, subject to the compensation committee's ongoing review.

Deductibility of Executive Compensation

Section 162(m) of the Code denies a federal income tax deduction for certain compensation in excess of $1.0 million per year paid to the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, the three other most highly paid executive officers of a publicly traded corporation, and anyone previously subject to Section 162(m) as a covered employee for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016. It is the policy of Kaleyra to consider the tax impact of its compensation arrangements as one factor, among others, in evaluating and determining the structure, implementation, and amount of awards paid to its executive officers. However, to retain highly skilled executives and remain competitive with other employers, the Compensation Committee may authorize compensation that would not be deductible under Section 162(m) or otherwise if it determines that such compensation is in the best interests of the company and its stockholders, and maintaining tax deductibility will not be the sole consideration taken into account in determining what compensation arrangements are in our and our stockholders' best interests. The right to grant compensation that is not deductible is expressly reserved, and Kaleyra may do so.

Director Compensation

Kaleyra's Compensation Committee determines the annual compensation to be paid to the members of its Board. Following are the tabular disclosures of Kaleyra's executive officer and director compensation:

Summary Compensation Table

The table below sets forth the annual compensation levels of the NEOs, who as a smaller reporting company consist of the principal executive officer who serves as Chief Executive Officer of Kaleyra, and the next two most highly compensated executive officers. The compensation totals and individual amounts reflect the compensation of such officers by Kaleyra as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in 2020, the Company only has two executive officers). In fiscal year 2022, such totals and amounts may change based, on among other things, changes to the terms of the employment of such persons. The stockholders of the Company approved, on an advisory basis, the 2021 compensation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer at the annual meeting of stockholders in 2020.

Employment Arrangements with Named Executive Officers

Employment Agreement with Dario Calogero

On March 13, 2020, Kaleyra entered into an employment agreement with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Dario Calogero (the "Calogero Employment Agreement"). The Calogero Employment Agreement is for a three-year period commencing on November 26, 2019. It provides that Mr. Calogero shall serve as the Chief Executive Officer of Kaleyra and its subsidiaries, with services to be provided both in New York, New York and in Milan, Italy. The Calogero Employment Agreement provides that Mr. Calogero will receive a base salary at an annual rate of $450,000, subject to increase from time to time as determined by the Board or its Compensation Committee, as well as that he shall be eligible to receive an annual bonus and long-term equity-based awards. The target bonus opportunity for Mr. Calogero is 100% of his base salary (the "Annual Target Bonus"), and at the discretion of the Board, he may also be granted a special achievement bonus in recognition of a special event or achievement that has significantly improved the performance, strength or nature of Kaleyra and its business. Payment of a bonus based upon the Annual Target Bonus shall be done after the Compensation Committee has determined in its sole and absolute discretion whether Mr. Calogero's performance has achieved the OKR, or other performance objectives established for purposes of bonuses. Beginning in 2021, Mr. Calogero is also eligible to receive grants of long-term awards in the form of cash and/or equity awards under the Kaleyra, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan. The Calogero Employment Agreement also provides that Mr. Calogero is eligible to participate in the all employee benefit and insurance plans that Kaleyra maintains for similarly situated executives, and that he will receive a relocation allowance covering the period of time that Mr. Calogero is based in New York of $400,000 per year.

In the event that Mr. Calogero's employment is terminated for "cause" byKaleyraor because he resigns without "good reason" (as such terms are defined in the Calogero Employment Agreement), then he will be paid his base salary for the period prior to the effective date of termination and any accrued but unused vacation time, unreimbursed expenses and other payments and benefits prior to such termination. IfKaleyraterminates his employment without cause or he terminates his employment for good reason, then he will receive additional payments fromKaleyra. If such termination is not within the two-year period following a Change in Control (as such term is defined in the Calogero Employment Agreement), then Mr. Calogero will receive in addition to that which he would receive if his employment is terminated for cause, as a severance an amount equal to two times the sum of (1) his base salary, plus (2) an amount equal to his Annual Target Bonus, plus a bonus for the year of termination, as well as immediate vesting of any service-based vesting conditions applicable to long-term awards previously granted, provided that any performance-vesting conditions shall still apply. Mr. Calogero will also receive insurance coverage for two years. If such termination is within the two-year period following a Change in Control, then the severance amount shall be for three times, rather than two times, the sum of (1) his base salary, plus (2) an amount equal to his Annual Target Bonus. In addition, if Mr. Calogero's employment terminates because he becomes disabled or he dies, then there shall be immediate vesting of any outstanding, unvested long-term awards, including any performance-based awards.

Employment Agreement with Giacomo Dall'Aglio

Prior to June 2021, as approved by the Board in December 2019, Kaleyra's EVP and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Dall'Aglio received a base salary at an annual rate of €250,000, subject to increase from time to time as determined by the Board or its Compensation Committee, a monthly relocation allowance covering the period of time that Mr. Dall'Aglio is based in New York at the annual rate of €175,000 (which ended on June 30, 2021), and eligibility to receive a bonus of 50% of his base salary based upon financial and operational objectives achievable within an applicable fiscal year as well as long-term equity-based awards.

Kaleyra also on March 13, 2020, entered into an amendment of awards with Mr. Dall'Aglio (the "Dall'Aglio Amendment of Awards"). The Dall'Aglio Amendment of Awards provided that if Mr. Dall'Aglio's employment is terminated for "cause" by Kaleyra or because he resigns without "good reason" (as such terms are defined in the Dall'Aglio Amendment of Awards) within the twelve months following a Covered Transaction (as such term is defined in the Kaleyra, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan), then one hundred percent of the remaining unvested long-term awards issued to Mr. Dall'Aglio in accordance with the terms of the Kaleyra, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, shall become vested and immediately exercisable if the award requires exercise, and one hundred percent of the remaining undelivered shares shall be delivered for such awards that are restricted stock units.

On June 2, 2021, Kaleyra entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Dall'Aglio (the "Dall'Aglio Employment Agreement"). The Dall'Aglio Employment Agreement, which is effective as of June 1, 2021, is for a three-year period which extends automatically for successive three-year periods unless either Kaleyra or Mr. Dall'Aglio give prior notice that they elect not to extend the employment relationship. The Dall'Aglio Employment Agreement cancels and supersedes all prior agreements pertaining to the employment and compensation of Mr. Dall'Aglio, including the Dall'Aglio Amendment of Awards, but not any RSUs granted to Mr. Dall'Aglio or his indemnification agreement with the Company. The Dall'Aglio Employment Agreement provides that Mr. Dall'Aglio shall serve as EVP and Chief Financial Officer of Kaleyra and its subsidiaries, with services to be performed at Kaleyra's headquarters in New York or such other location as might be mutually agreed. Under the Dall'Aglio Employment Agreement Mr. Dall'Aglio will receive a base salary at an annual rate of $300,000, subject to increase from time to time as determined by the Board or its Compensation Committee. In addition, Mr. Dall'Aglio will be eligible to receive an annual bonus and long-term equity-based awards. The target bonus opportunity for Mr. Dall'Aglio is 50% of his base salary (the "Dall'Aglio Annual Target Bonus"), and at the discretion of the Board, he may also be granted a special achievement bonus in recognition of a special event or achievement that has significantly improved the performance, strength or nature of Kaleyra and its business. Payment of a bonus based upon the Dall'Aglio Annual Target Bonus shall be done after the Compensation Committee has determined in its sole and absolute discretion whether Mr. Dall'Aglio's performance has achieved the OKR, or other performance objectives established for purposes of bonuses. Beginning in 2021, Mr. Dall'Aglio is also eligible to receive grants of long-term awards in the form of cash and/or equity awards under the Kaleyra, Inc.

2019 Equity Incentive Plan. TheDall'AglioEmployment Agreement also provides that Mr.Dall'Agliois eligible to participate in the all employee benefit and insurance plans thatKaleyramaintains for similarly situated executives.

Additionally, either Kaleyra or Mr. Dall'Aglio may terminate the Dall'Aglio Employment Agreement at any time. Kaleyra's right to terminate Mr. Dall'Aglio's employment is subject to its obligation to make certain severance payments and provide certain other benefits to Mr. Dall'Aglio, depending upon the circumstances under which the employment relationship is terminated. Kaleyra is generally not obligated under the Dall'Aglio Employment Agreement to provide any severance payments if Mr. Dall'Aglio is terminated for cause or if Mr. Dall'Aglio resigns without good reason. If Mr. Dall'Aglio's employment is terminated by Kaleyra without cause, or Mr. Dall'Aglio resigns for good reason, in each case other than in connection with a change in control (as defined in the Dall'Aglio Employment Agreement), Mr. Dall'Aglio will be entitled to receive (A) a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of (i) his then-current base salary and (ii) the amount equal to 100% of his annual target bonus, (B) Mr. Dall'Aglio's then applicable target annual bonus for the year in which the termination occurred, (C) accelerated vesting of any service-based vesting conditions applicable on any outstanding long-term awards, (D) any other benefits Mr. Dall'Aglio is entitled to in accordance with any terms of any plan, arrangement or programs maintained by Kaleyra, and (E) continued coverage under Kaleyra's medical, dental, life and disability insurance for the shorter of (i) the one-year period following termination or (ii) the date on which Mr. Dall'Aglio obtains comparable coverage under a subsequent employer plan. If Mr. Dall'Aglio's employment is terminated by Kaleyra without cause, or Mr. Dall'Aglio resigns for good reason, in each case within a one-year period following a change in control, then Mr. Dall'Aglio will be entitled to receive the same severance amounts as described above. The receipt of any severance is subject to Mr. Dall'Aglio's signing a release of claims in favor of Kaleyra.

The Dall'Aglio Employment Agreement also contains restrictive covenants relating to the protection of confidential information, non-disclosure, non-competition and non-solicitation. The non-compete and non-solicitation covenants generally continue for a period of 12 months following the termination of employment.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.

Notes Payable to the Sellers

At the closing of the Business Combination, Kaleyra issued unsecured convertible promissory notes to each of Esse Effe and Maya in the amount of $6.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively, and also issued other unsecured promissory notes to each of Esse Effe and Maya in the identical respective amounts (the "Notes payable to the Sellers"). The unsecured promissory notes held by Esse Effe and Maya were paid in full during fiscal year 2020 and no amount remains outstanding for such notes as of December 31, 2021. Interest on the Notes Payable to the Sellers shall accrue at a fixed interest rate equal to the one-year U.S. dollar LIBOR interest rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the date of the Business Combination, plus a margin of one percent (1%) per annum.

On the fifteen-month anniversary of the Business Combination date or February 25, 2021, the fifty percent (50%) of the previously outstanding amount of Business Combination Convertible Notes held by Esse Effe and Maya was repaid, with a total of $3.0 million and $750,000 in principal and $176,000 and $44,000 in accrued interest being paid to Esse Effe and Maya, respectively, pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Convertible Notes.

Under the terms of the Business Combination Convertible Notes, the outstanding principal balance of the Business Combination Convertible Notes, plus all accrued and unpaid interest and fees due under these notes, became due and payable, upon the receipt by the Company of cash proceeds of an equity financing in an aggregate gross amount of $105.0 million or 8,400,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock at $12.50 per share issued to the PIPE Investors in the private placement equity financing event immediately prior to the closing of the Merger Agreement of June 1, 2021. The principal amount of $3.8 million plus accrued interest of $84,000 for the Business Combination Convertible Notes held by Esse Effe and Maya was paid in full on June 2, 2021. Following the repayment, the Business Combination Convertible Notes terminated pursuant to their terms and no further amounts were due.

During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Kaleyra S.p.A. purchased legal services by a partner of Studio Legale Chiomenti who is a family member of a key manager of Kaleyra S.p.A. Costs incurred by Kaleyra S.p.A. for the above legal services were $159,000 and $363,000 in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Employee Relationships

Alessandra Levy, the spouse of Kaleyra's Chief Executive Officer, Dario Calogero is an employee within the marketing team of Kaleyra S.p.A. Ms. Levy received salary and benefits in the amount of $245,000 and $237,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Pietro Calogero, the son of Kaleyra's Chief Executive Officer, Dario Calogero is an employee within the marketing team of Kaleyra S.p.A. Mr. Calogero received salary and benefits in the amount of $55,000 and $35,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Solutions Infini Preference shares

As a part of the Solutions Infini purchase agreement, Kaleyra assumed the obligation to purchase preference shares from certain executive managers of Solutions Infini in 2020 at a variable price determined based upon the target EBITDA of Solutions Infini expected for the year ending March 31, 2020. From an accounting perspective, these preference shares represent compensation for future services for the eligible employees. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the outstanding obligation for preference shares due to executive managers was zero. See Note 14 - Preference Shares Liabilities - for further details.

Director Independence

The NYSE requires that a majority of our Board must be composed of "independent directors," which is defined generally as a person other than an executive officer or employee of Kaleyra or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion of our Board would interfere with the director's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.

Dr. Katz, Dr. Hirsch and Messrs. Miotto, Mikulsky and Lodrini are our independent directors. Our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. Dr. Katz presides at these meetings of our independent directors. Any affiliated transactions will be on terms no less favorable to Kaleyra than could be obtained from independent parties. Any affiliated transactions must be approved by a majority of our independent and disinterested directors.

Related Party Policy

Kaleyra's Code of Ethics requires us to avoid, wherever possible, all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interests, except under guidelines approved by the Board of Directors (or the Audit Committee). Related-party transactions are defined as transactions in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year, (2) Kaleyra or any of Kaleyra's subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any (a) executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director, (b) greater than 5% beneficial owner of Kaleyra's shares of common stock, or (c) immediate family member, of the persons referred to in clauses (a) and (b), has or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity). A conflict of interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position.

Kaleyra's Audit Committee, pursuant to its written charter, will be responsible for reviewing and approving related-party transactions to the extent Kaleyra enters into such transactions. The Audit Committee will consider all relevant factors when determining whether to approve a related party transaction, including whether the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable to us than terms generally available from an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction. No director may participate in the approval of any transaction in which he is a related party, but that director is required to provide the Audit Committee with all material information concerning the transaction. Kaleyra also requires each of Kaleyra's directors and executive officers to complete a directors' and officers' questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions.

These procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer.

UniCredit says full Russia write-off would cost 7.4 bln euros

MILAN, March 8 (Reuters) - Italy's second-biggest bank UniCredit said a full write-off of its Russian business, including cross-border exposure, would cost around 7.4 billion euros ($8.1 billion), leaving its capital distribution plans hanging by a thread.

UniCredit, which is one of Europe's banks most exposed to Russia, said it would still be able to pay proposed cash dividends for 2021 even in an extreme scenario where it zeroed its exposure.

That would shave two percentage points off a key capital ratio, which stood at 15.03% at the end of last year - lowering to just above 13%.

"Whilst we do not consider this extreme scenario as our base case, we are taking a prudent and sustainable approach to our distributions," UniCredit said.

Provided the ratio remains above 13%, UniCredit said it remained committed to buying back its own shares for up to 2.58 billion euros under the strategy new CEO Andrea Orcel announced in December.

"An ultimate capital impact from our Russian exposures lower than 200 basis points will enable us to use up to an equivalent amount for the share buyback," it said.

Orcel's payout pledge had lifted UniCredit shares to a four-year high of 15.85 euros a share last month, before tensions over Ukraine mounted.

The stock closed up 6% at 9.017 euros on Tuesday, having lost more than 40% from last month's highs.

Analysts had warned Russian exposure cast a shadow over Orcel's payout plans, which in turn are a key element in the former UBS banker's M&A strategy.

Before Russia invaded Ukraine, Orcel had been poised to launch a takeover offer for smaller rival Banco BPM in an all-share deal that aimed to capitalise on the share price recovery, sources have previously told Reuters.

UniCredit said its Russian client cross border exposure stood at 4.5 billion euros, net of guarantees of around 1 billion euros by non-Russian state export agencies.

Around 30% of the exposure is to oil and gas companies with sanction-hit counterparties accounting for less than 5% of the total.

UniCredit Bank Russia, its local arm and Russia's 14th largest lender, had risk-weighted assets of 9.4 billion euros at the end of 2021.

"Net of forex exchange hedges, our direct exposure to UniCredit Bank Russia is reduced to around 1.9 billion euros," it said.

UniCredit could potentially suffer an up to 1 billion euro loss due to its derivatives exposure to Russian banks under the extreme scenario.

RIYADH: The war between Russia and Ukraine continues to affect countries, firms, and industries worldwide with concerns focused on energy supplies and rising prices.

While solar and renewable stocks are gaining wider attention, chip supply chain issues are seen lingering as a result of the war.

Countries such as Italy are pursuing initiatives to back certain industries in the sector such as electric vehicles, while firms such as KKR & Co are looking to expand into clean energy.

Looking at the bigger picture:

· Solar and renewable stocks have jumped in trading as the US and UK are moving to sanction Russian oil, Bloomberg reported.#

This is on the back of soaring oil prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to reach $100 per barrel.

· Italy will subsidize as much as 6,000 euros ($6,570) of the price of new electric cars in its attempt to back the country’s auto sector, Reuters reported.

The European country has also pledged a total of 8.7 billion euros until the year 2030 to boost its automotive industry. Of the total budget, an average of 700 million are set aside for 2022 alone.

· The UK plans to ramp up oil and gas production as it moves to ban Russian imports by the end of 2022.

“We don't buy proportionately very much Russian oil and gas and we do also produce our own so we'll step that up as well," Transport Minister Grant Shapps told Sky News.

Through a micro lens:

·German motor vehicle manufacturer Volkswagen has announced that it will stop taking orders for several plug-in hybrid models starting from Wednesday due to the chip supply crunch which was deepened by the military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, Reuters reported.

The plug-in hybrid models include Golf, Tiguan, Passat, Arteon, and Touareg.

·American global investment company KKR & Co. is contemplating the acquisition of French independent renewable energy producer Albioma SA, Bloomberg reported.

This comes as the investment firm is seeking to expand into renewable energy.

Mystery £532million superyacht rumoured to be Putin's swarmed by Italian cops

A massive superyacht, rumoured to be owned by Russian president Vladimir Putin is being investigated by Italian officials as Europe continues to seize Russian assets

Italian officials[https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/police] are investigating the ownership of a superyacht anchored on the Tuscan coast.

The yacht, worth £532 million, and measuring a staggering 459 feet, is believed to be owned by Russian[https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/russia] president Vladimir Putin[https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/vladimir-putin], but has never been confirmed.

But now Italian law enforcement has been spotted swarming the boat, called Scheherazade, in an attempt to clarify the situation.

The boat's captain Guy Bennett-Pearce told the New York Times: “They are looking hard.

“They are looking at every aspect.

“This isn’t the local coppers coming down, these are men in dark suits -I had no choice but to hand over documents.

“I have never seen him. I have never met him.

“I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that this will clear the vessel of all negative rumours and speculations”

If it's proven to be owned by the man who ordered the invasion of Ukraine[https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/ukraine], the boat will be seized as part of a Europe-wide crackdown on Russia[https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/russia] and Russian assets.

It comes off the back of Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich [https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/breaking-roman-abramovich-sanctioned-chelsea-26431843]– who is a known close ally of Putin -being been sanctioned by the UK government early today due to his ties to the president.

The UK government said it was targeting him for being one of the "few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin" and his stakes in steel company Evraz, and the sanction has significant consequences for Chelsea.

Evraz steel -it is claimed -is used to make the Russian tanks currently attempting to sweep across Ukraine in Vladimir Putin's bloody war.

Abramovich is known to have ties to Putin, according to an 2021 High Court hearing in which a judge said the Chelsea owner had "very good relations" with and "privileged access to" the Russian president.

Solaris is tracked off coast of Sicily, joining hurried sailings of Russian yachts to avoid seizureUkraine-Russia war – latest updatesThe oligarchs and business figures on western sanction lists

Roman Abramovich’s superyacht Solaris was heading east across the Mediterranean on Thursday after sanctions were extended to the Chelsea FC owner.

His $600m vessel, tracked off the coast of Sicily on Thursday, appeared to have joined the hurried sailings of Russian oligarchs moving their superyachts across the world to avoid seizure by governments enforcing sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The Solaris left the Barcelona port where it had been undergoing repairs on Tuesday, according to Reuters, and by Thursday afternoon it was rounding the southern coast of Sicily. Abramovich’s other yacht, the even more luxurious Eclipse – estimated to be worth more than $1bn after extensive renovations[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/29/superyacht-sales-surge-prompts-fresh-calls-for-curbs-on-their-emissions] – set sail east from the Caribbean island of St Maarten towards international waters shortly after other oligarchs’ yachts were seized.

The Eclipse had crossed much of the Atlantic by midday Thursday when it was located to the west of the Canary Islands according to vesselfinder.com.

Abramovich was sanctioned by the US in 2018 but joined the UK list on Thursday morning. A spokesperson for Abramovich said earlier this week: “We never comment on the movements of the yacht or any other vehicles or vessels.”

The 163-metre Eclipse, which includes nine decks, two helipads and a 16-metre swimming pool that can be converted into a dancefloor, is the most expensive vessel owned by individuals on the growing US, EU and UK sanction lists.

Many super-rich Russians – including some not yet on the sanctions list, but with links to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin – appear to be attempting to move their superyachts to countries without formal extradition agreements with western governments.

French and Italian authorities last week seized three yachts worth more than $225m (£170m).

Tracking data from the shipping intelligence service MarineTraffic[https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:-12.0/centery:25.0/zoom:4] shows that Titan, a $100m superyacht owned by Alexander Abramov, a billionaire iron and steel magnate, arrived in Maldives waters last week after sailing from Fethiye in Turkey. Its owner, who holds a big stake alongside Abramovich in the London-listed coal and steel group Evraz, is not on any sanctions lists.

Clio, a $65m superyacht owned by the aluminium billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who has been subject to US sanctions since 2018, was reported last week to be heading for Raa Atoll in the Maldives. The Maldives is an Indian Ocean island nation with no extradition treaty with the US or the EU.

The US president, Joe Biden, said last week the US was actively working to seize the superyachts, luxury apartments and private jets of oligarchs linked to Putin. “We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,” he said in his State of the Union address[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/mar/01/joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-putin-russia-ukraine-live-latest].

The White House spokesperson, Jen Psaki, added: “We want [Putin] to feel the squeeze, we want the people around him to feel the squeeze.”

Grant Shapps, the UK transport secretary, said the government would detain any yachts suspected of being Russian-owned if they entered UK waters. “I want to make it impossible for individuals with links to Putin to use their aircraft in UK airspace, at UK airports or airfields, and any aircraft suspected of being linked to Russia will be detained,” he said. “Likewise, their yachts. Any of these floating gin palaces with an identifiable Russian connection will be detained if it attempts to dock in a British port.”

France detained Amore Vero[https://www.superyachtfan.com/yacht/amore-vero/], a 280ft, $120m superyacht they said was owned by Igor Sechin, in the Mediterranean port of La Ciotat. Sechin, who is also facing sanctions, is the chief executive of the Russian oil producer Rosneft and a close ally of Putin. Amore Vero, which means “true love” in Italian, can accommodate 14 guests and 28 crew.

French police, who boarded the vessel at night last week, said the ship was in port for repairs, but its crew were “making arrangements to leave in a hurry, without having completed the planned work”.

Italy’s Guardia di Finanza boarded and impounded Lena[https://www.sanlorenzoyacht.com/uk/superyacht/lena.asp], a 41-metre, $45m yacht owned by Gennady Timchenko, a close friend of Putin who has an estimated $21bn fortune held in several large Russian raw materials companies, in Sanremo. Lady M, a 64-metre, $60m yacht owned by Alexei Mordashov, was seized in the nearby Ligurian port of Imperia.

Dilbar[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbar_(yacht)], the world’s largest superyacht by gross tonnage, which the US government said is owned by Alisher Usmanov[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/03/alisher-usmanov-ex-fencer-who-solves-putin-business-problems-sanction-eu-oligarch], was reported to have been seized in Hamburg. However, German authorities later clarified that the 156-metre vessel, which has been valued at $600m, has not been impounded but requires an export waiver to leave the port.

Usmanov, who reportedly owns Witanhurst, the second biggest private home in the UK after Buckingham Palace, was added to the EU’s sanction list on Wednesday. The US imposed sanctions on him last week after the White House described him as a “one of Russia’s wealthiest individuals and a close ally of Putin”.

The yachts identified by the Guardian as linked to oligarchs are worth more than $3bn. The ultimate ownership of superyachts can be difficult to confirm as many are owned through shell companies registered in tax havens.

Russian ban leaves Gazprom cyclists in 'total uncertainty'

The ban on Russian cycling has left riders on the Gazprom/RusVelo team in "total uncertainty", Italian rider Marco Canola told AFP on Saturday.

"Some of us risk ending our careers there, which would be very unfair," the 33-year-old, a Giro d'Italia stage winner in 2014, said in a phone interview.

The International Cycling Union (UCI) responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by banning Russian and Belarusian teams and riders.

Gazprom, in UCI's second-tier 'Pro Teams' category, was the highest-level Russian team.

Canola, and the team, were slated to ride this week in the Tirreno-Adriatico, a race that ends Sunday.

"If there is no alternative by March 27, we will be forced to close," said Renat Khamidulin, the team's sporting director, told Italian media.

Gazprom has 21 riders, including nine Russians and seven Italians.

Canola argued that Gazprom was in a "sorry situation" because "we are a very European team".

"The team headquarters are in Switzerland, the language spoken internally is Italian and among the riders there are many Italians, a Spaniard, a Norwegian, two Czechs," he said.

"The only thing that connects us to Russia is the name, because Gazprom is the main sponsor."

But he said, after the invasion "the team "removed the name from the jerseys and we were ready to go racing without sponsorship".

"It is obviously unnecessary to say that none of us want this war. And obviously none of us are responsible for anything. This decision has thrown us all into total uncertainty," added Canola.

He said "the team has never stopped" since the sanction, with riders continuing to train in groups or alone.

"We must continue to fight and start again from where we left off, with a victory in the UAE Tour", where 19-year-old Czech Mathias Vacek won a stage.

While the Gazprom team could not be reached for comment on Saturday, Canola was echoing many points made by Khamidulin, a Russian former cyclist, to Italian cycling media.

"Our team could be a messenger of peace. We don't want war, we want peace," Khamidulin said.

"We had already prepared our cars to be neutral, in white. As well as the jerseys, which are white, to bring a message of peace," he said. "We were ready to do our part, but the IOC and then the UCI cut our legs off, but not our hope."

He said the team was in dialogue with the UCI and made it clear that they were looking for a new backer.

"We have a healthy, competitive, winning team with an effective staff. I think this could be an important starting point for interested sponsors."

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HALA GORANI, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Welcome to our viewers around the world and in the United States this hour. I'm Hala Gorani coming to you live from Lviv in Ukraine.

A number of developments we're following this hour as Russia's invasion of this country pushes well into its third week. In the hours ahead, we are expecting the next round of talks between Ukraine and Russia in the latest effort to find a diplomatic way out of this war.

Right now, though, unfortunately there is no end in sight. Mariupol is among the cities under heavy bombardment and concerns are mounting for the civilians who remain trapped there. Still, we are learning that Moscow may be looking for help as senior U.S. official says Russia has asked China for military assistance in Ukraine, including for some drones. And Moscow could soon find itself even under more pressure.

France says that the President, Emmanuel Macron, and the American President, Joe Biden, spoke by phone on Sunday yesterday and agreed to strengthen sanctions against Russia. Mr. Macron says he spoke with the Ukrainian leader who took to social media to rally his country.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): We are going through the worst or deal in our history, in our lives. We protect the most precious thing we have. We must hold on. We might fight and we will win. I know that. I believe in that.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GORANI: As the conflict grinds on, one thing seems increasingly clear. Russia's military attacks against Ukraine are growing more destructive.

Here's CNN's Oren Liebermann with more.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: The attack on the Yavoriv military base is the closest Russian attack to a NATO member. The barrage of missiles hit just about 11 miles from Poland killing at least 35 people. According to Lviv military administration and wounding more than 100 others. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine grows more destructive by the day.

Near the city of Mykolaiv on the Black Sea, nine people were killed in a Russian bombardment according to the regional administration. And satellite images show the city of Mariupol burning. Russia has besieged the city for days Ukrainian officials say, leaving hundreds of thousands without power and water. Nearly 2,200 people have been killed there since Russia's invasion began according to the city council.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says help is on the way if it can get through.

ZELENSKYY (through translator): Our humanitarian convoys two hours away with only 80 kilometers remaining. We are doing everything possible to fight the resistance of the occupants who block even the Orthodox church priests who are escorting the convoy with food, water, medication. Ukraine has supplied 100 tons of the basic necessities for its citizens.

LIEBERMANN: Among those killed in this war, American journalist Brent Renaud. Russian forces shot him outside of Kyiv according to regional police. Another journalist was wounded.

JUAN ARREDONDO, PHOTOJOURNALIST: So, the driver turned around and they kept shooting. It's two of us.

LIEBERMANN: The widening attack on Ukraine has not deterred the U.S. and NATO allies from shipping in weapons and equipment that are proven effective in slowing down Russia.

JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: We believe we will continue to flow substantial amounts of military assistance and weapons to the front lines to help the Ukrainians ensure that Ukraine is a strategic failure for Vladimir Putin.

LIEBERMANN: Multiple rounds of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine have led to few, if any breakthroughs. Another round of talks is set for Monday.

WENDY SHERMAN, U.S. DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE: We are seeing some signs of a willingness to have real serious negotiations, but I have to say, as your reporter said, so far it appears that Vladimir Putin is intent on destroying Ukraine.

LIEBERMANN: Ukraine's resistance has slowed the Russian advance toward the capital city of Kyiv. Russia has so far been unable to encircle the city. Meanwhile, the U.S. is watching for any threat of chemical weapons from Russia in a possible false flag operation.

JOHN KIRBY, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: It is of the Russian playbook that that which they accuse you of they are planning to do. Now, again, we haven't seen anything that indicates some sort of imminent chemical biological attack right now, but we are watching this very, very closely.

LIEBERMANN: A Russian air-strike Saturday night damaged the Holy Dormition Svyatogorsk Lavra monastery in the Donetsk region, according to Ukraine's parliament the historic church sheltered more than 500 displace people, the parliament said.

[03:04:55]

In Kherson, the first major Ukrainian city to fall to Russia, protest was held a mass rally. Marching amid armed Russian troops, a brazen show of spirit for Ukraine in Kherson's Svobody Square, which means freedom square.

Another $200 million in security assistance approved by the White House over the weekend. That's after they approved 350 million just a couple of weeks ago. So we see the White House and the Biden administration moving very quickly here.

Again, within just a couple of weeks more than half a billion dollars. And where these used to take weeks if not months to get in, it's now getting in within days. Anti-tank, anti-armor, anti-aircraft missiles and more.

Oren Liebermann, CNN, at the Pentagon.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

GORANI: Well, against this backdrop, the White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan will meet his Chinese counterpart in Rome in the next few hours. This comes amid reports that Russia is asking China for economic and military assistance in Ukraine.

CNN's Nina Dos Santos will be joining us in a little bit unless she's with us now. I know she will be in a little bit. First, let's of go to Steven Jiang in Beijing. Apologies, Steven. Hi again. Any response from China to this reported call for assistance from Russia?

STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: Well, Hala, the Chinese foreign ministry is going to start its daily press briefing in just a few minutes. Let's see what their spokesman will say. But I expect officials to very much stick to their long-standing talking points to stress China's imposed partiality in this conflict and probably denouncing the U.S. effort to, quote, unquote, "smear China" and, again, blaming the U.S. and NATO's eastward expansion for causing this war which, of course, is very much parroting a key Kremlin talking point.

But this leak from Washington, the timing of this is very interesting as you mention because this is putting China under a spotlight for its role in this war just as Jake Sullivan is about to meet Yang Jiechi, who is a key adviser to President Xi Jinping in Rome in the coming hours. Perhaps in anticipation of Washington those exerting more pressure over Beijing, Chinese state media has been trying to push back warning the U.S. against this approach and also cautioning the U.S. not try to assert division between Moscow and Beijing.

Obviously since the war broke out, China has been trying to strike an almost impossible balance. They try to stand behind Russia especially when it comes to parroting a lot of the propaganda, some would say disinformation from the Kremlin, but also trying to say the right thing at least in public in terms of respecting all countries sovereignty and calling for peace talks.

But at the same time, they're also trying to minimize the impact of severe western sanctions. Chinese entities, which, of course, have a lot of exposure to the western markets. That's why in the past few days, some analysts have pointed to some subtle signs of changes from Beijing, including China sending humanitarian assistance on a very small scale to Ukraine, and also some indication from some Chinese entities of their willingness to comply with western sanctions.

But at the end of day, experts we talk to say China is very much very pragmatic. Their self-interest is paramount. At this stage the leadership just simply does not see a lot of upsides in getting deeply involved in a war not fought on their soil. Because the way they see it, no matter what happens on the battlefield eventually a weakened and bitter Russia would have no choice but to move ever closer into China's orbit as a junior partner in this so-called no limits partnership.

That's why a lot of experts are still very skeptical at this stage that China would be willing to getting involved directly in this war, especially militarily. Hala?

GORANI: Steven, I mean, I wonder, though, China is suffering tremendously economically from the rise in commodity prices, from this war that is having a big negative impact on its much hoped for post COVID recovery. So, it really would not, I mean logically speaking, want this war to continue. Can it put actually do the reverse and put pressure on Russia to back down? Does it have that ability? And does it have that will and desire?

JIANG: I think from western leaders -- western government's perspective, China certainly can. But the question is whether they will. At this stage from what they've been saying, which is a lot, but what they have been doing is very little, it seems their strategy is not take that approach. Our suggestion from the west. And that could be because of several reasons.

One of them which, of course, is this relationship between Xi Jinping and Putin has been portrayed in such a personal kind of way, you know. Xi has called Putin his best friend. And given Xi's supremacy and his power here, it's very difficult for him to climb down from that for now. But also, as I mentioned pragmatically speaking, they just don't see a lot of benefits for them to getting involved directly and deeply at this stage, Hala.

[03:10:01]

GORANI: All right, Steven Jiang, thanks very much. Ukraine's president is warning that it's only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on people in NATO territory if the western block does not close the skies above Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday renewed his call for a no-fly zone over his country to help stop Russia's attacks. However, that move would be an escalation that the U.S. and its allies have so far been unwilling to make.

Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby gave this frank explanation.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KIRBY: Look, I mean, no-fly zone has a nice air policing kind of sound to it. But I participated in one as a young officer on an aircraft carrier way back in the early 90s. It is combat. You have to be willing to shoot and to be shot at. President Biden has made it clear that U.S. troops are not going to be fighting in Ukraine.

And there is a good reason for that, because the United States getting involved in combat in Ukraine right now or over the skies of Ukraine right now leads to war with Russia. And there is very little that you can see that would make sense for this war to be escalated between two nuclear powers.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GORANI: The Pentagon spokesperson there. Now I'd like to bring in Orysia Lutsevich joining me from London. She is the director of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House where she is also a research fellow. Thanks for joining us.

So, what options do the Ukrainians have right now? The no-fly zone is a non-starter for western allies and NATO countries. They've been quite clear about that. What do they need the west to do in order for their fight against Russia to have -- in order to be able to repel the Russian invader at this point?

ORYSIA LUTSEVICH, RESEARCH FELLOW, CHATHAM HOUSE: Well, look, we are moving in again in a critical -- what is happening in the ground in Ukraine especially in the east around Mariupol and possibly Odessa, and eventually, the battle for Kyiv. And I think what is critical is that there is more forceful imaginative provision of military assistance. And there a couple of principles that are important.

Obviously, Ukraine is quite successfully prevailing on the ground defending its territory. But anti-aircraft missile systems are key because Russia is increasingly using aviation to bombard civilian infrastructures, civilian cities in order to put pressure on Ukraine's political leadership to concede.

So, it's important that there is a lot of confidentiality about what kind of armament is being provided and where are the roots of those. Because we have seen over the weekend an assault on a military training ground all the way in the western part of Ukrainian/Polish border.

But what Ukraine needs, again, is military and economic assistance to persevere. Because every day Ukraine stands, it will get a better deal at the negotiating table with Russia eventually.

GORANI: And when you say that, you say a better negotiating position with Russia. What will it take to get to that, to that stage, to get to the negotiating stage where seriously there is talk of ending this senseless war here?

LUTSEVICH: Well, what has to happen is the Kremlin must understand that it simply cannot win. It simply cannot achieve those ridiculous objectives that Putin identified, such as, you know, complete demilitarization, some imaginative denotification of Ukraine.

And actually, one of Putin's objectives is to slice Ukraine into some kind of region and reconstitute Ukrainian state to take over Kyiv and install a puppet government. But also, Ukraine has to understand that militarily it will be difficult to persevere for too long. So, as long as Ukraine keeps the fences of its key cities and it's able to keep the negotiating open, but also let's remember all those economic warfare efforts that the west is imposing on Russia will eventually weaken Russian access to funds to support military -- support war in Ukraine. War costs money.

GORANI: Yes, war costs money. Vladimir Putin is going to have a very hard time raising money. His central bank is unable now to raise funds outside of just printing rubles, not able to raise funds outside of Russia. The stock market has crashed. The currency has crashed. The economy is going to crash as well.

At what point is this too expensive for the Russian president, or is he so determined because he believes ideologically that he'd rather just level this country to rubble if it means getting control over it rather than just letting it go and saving his own country?

[03:14:57]

LUTSEVICH: Well, it sounds horrific, but leveling country to rubble and having control of it are two very different things. If you level the country by bombardment, you eventually recognize that you cannot take over the cities.

So clearly, Putin is determined, there's no doubt about it. The defeat by Ukrainian armed forces would be deeply humiliating to Putin. But we must remember that Putin completely controls media space in Russia, and he can turn around --

GORANI: Yes.

LUTSEVICH: -- whatever he needs as a ramp for his population to present it as a victory. He could say, I already bombed military infrastructure. I have achieved my objective. But we should be, you know, clear that Putin's objectives and messaging will be changing as long as Ukraine shows military success and backing of the west of what we discussed at the beginning maintains.

GORANI: But from the outside looking in, I mean, very few of us -- I don't know if you did -- even expected an invasion. And then in the first few weeks when it was clear the Russian military was not making lightning advances and taking Kyiv and other big cities quickly, the thinking was, well, Putin is going to realize that this is too costly in men, in money, in weaponry. And he'll back down and there will be some sort of diplomatic off-ramp. But that, too, doesn't seem to be happening. So, are you puzzled at all by this behavior?

LUTSEVICH: Well, I'm not puzzled because we do know that for the last eight years since the annexation of Crimea and limited war in Donbas, Putin was not achieving his objective which is to take over control of political decision making in Kyiv and to salvage all relations that Ukraine has with its western partners.

I'm not surprised he embarked on that war of terror. But like everybody else, I am astounded by this courage and total mobilization of Ukrainian society and resolve actually to make Putin fail. And I think the whole Europe will be better off if Putin's strategy militarily and Putin's ideology of this expansion fails, and Ukraine is determined to make its token of, you know, contribution to this victory.

GORANI: Yes, absolutely. It's something we witnessed here as well. We are even doing a story later on Ukrainians who left the country, but are returning to help with the war effort in their country. Orysia Lutsevich, thank you very much for joining us.

Another area of concern is Chernobyl. The international Atomic Energy Agency says the staff at the nuclear power plant is so tired that workers have stopped carrying out repairs and maintenance of safety equipment. The IAEA says the physical and psychological fatigue of working nonstop for nearly three weeks is to blame partly. The agency's director general has proposed a plan to deliver assistance, but it has to be approved by Ukrainian and Russian authorities before it's implemented. And remember Russia is controlling now Chernobyl.

Just ahead, Ukraine's train system is a reliable main stay of daily life even now. How rail operators are keeping people and supplies moving despite the Russian invasion.

Plus, hear from Kyiv's mayor and his brother as they vow to stay in the city and defend it from Russian soldiers.

[03:20:00]

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GORANI: Refugees fleeing the violence in Ukraine are braving brutal weather conditions during their journey to safety. Take a look at some of this video here. Temperatures are well below freezing as hundreds of refugees, including some very, very elderly people, wait in long lines to cross the Ukrainian border into Moldova.

According to the U.N. now, in total, 2.7 million people have fled, and Moldova's officials say more than 328,000 of them have arrived into their country. But many Ukrainians who have been forced to evacuate are hoping to return home.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN (through translator): We want to come back home. We have relatives there. Sisters, brothers, mothers. What is our plan? We will look if something remains from our house and we will rebuild it little by little, and we will build our city again for the people to come back and live calmly under peaceful sky.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GORANI: Well, despite the bombardments, Ukraine's railway system continues to be a reliable lifeline for its people. You can believe it. You can still take a train to Kyiv from here in Lviv. But obviously fears of being targeted by Russia are a challenge for all of its operators.

CNN's Scott McLean has their story.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: First light in Ternopil, Ukraine is the rising sun. The city's lights have been kept off since the war began. More than two weeks that have exhausted, overwhelmed and completely upended normal life. But through it all, Ukraine's rail network has kept running.

Every morning, the railway's executives led by 37-year-old Oleksandr Kamyshin gather for a morning call. No cell phones, no Zoom, just a Soviet era closed circuit phone system that connects every station. They won't stay here long. They can't. They believe they're a prime Russian target.

OLEKSANDR KAMYSHIN, CHAIRMAN, UKRAINIAN RAILWAYS: The strategy is to move fast so that they don't catch you.

MCLEAN: How long can you stay in one place?

KAMYSHIN: Hours.

MCLEAN: Instead, their work managing 230,000 employees continues on a single-car train headed west for now. Often their work is aboard ordinary passenger trains to blend in with the masses. Since the war began, they've been in near constant motion crisscrossing the country to keep the Russians guessing.

[03:25:03]

The decision to leave their headquarters in Kyiv was made in the early morning hours of February 24th. Kamyshin snapped one last picture with his two young kids, one still asleep.

Are they still in Ukraine? How does that make you feel?

KAMYSHIN: For me it's easier when I know that they are safe, and I have time to do my job.

MCLEAN: The country's rail network, one of the largest in the world, has been a lifeline in war, moving desperately needed supplies in and desperate people out of danger. More than two million since the invasion began. Schedules are drawn up the night before, and changed in response to panic scenes like this one in Kharkiv or in Lviv in the early days of war.

How on earth have people still been able to use the trains in a war zone?

KAMYSHIN: That's something which is surprising for the whole country and for the president as well.

MCLEAN: Surprising because every day the network is hit by Russian bombs. Small damage breaks the link between cities temporarily, a downed bridge indefinitely. Near Kharkiv, an undetonated bomb fell next to the tracks.

ROMAN CHERNITSKYI, UKRAINIAN RAILWAYS (through translator): We are reacting and repairing a railway even under artillery shelling every day. Unfortunately, some of my colleagues have been killed and injured during shelling.

MCLEAN: Thirty-three killed, 24 injured, and counting. The difficulty working aboard a moving train is that the cell phone signal is not always great. Now they do have Starlink internet systems now courtesy of Elon Musk, but they barely ever turn them on because they say it makes it easier for the Russians to target their location.

The Russians have taken control of rail links in cities like besieged Mariupol, Sumy, Kherson, and Chernihiv. But for now, all of the major hubs are still connected by Ukrainian rail.

How bad would it be if the Russians took these major stations?

KAMYSHIN: Really bad. Don't ask me how much, but really bad.

MCLEAN: When the train reaches Lviv, Kamyshin makes a quick visit to the main station. And more calls and meetings and a message for the rest of the world.

KAMYSHIN: What we can do, we already do. What west can do, close the sky and all the rest we'll do ourselves.

MCLEAN: Scott McLean, CNN in western Ukraine.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

GORANI: Ukrainian leaders and citizens alike are desperate to find a peaceful end to the war in this country. They also remain determined to defend their country until the Russian attacks stop. Kyiv's mayor and his twin brother spoke to CNN earlier about their country's united front.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

WLADIMIR KLITSCHKO, KYIV BRIGADE OF UKRAINIAN DEFENSE FORCE: The whole country is highly motivated to stop Russian aggression and the war. There is nothing that is possibly can break the will of our women and men. We all stand together and we are highly motivated to defend our country because this is our home. That's where our children were going to school. That's where our relatives buried in the ground.

This is our home, and there's no other way that we're going to leave. And why? Because this is our home. So, we will defend the country until last drop of the blood.

VITALI KLITSCHKO, MAYOR, KYIV, UKRAINE: And regarding -- and regarding how much time we have, we have a lot of time. It's we never lose the fight for our home for our future because whole population against Russian aggressors. And whole population, every one, and we never give up. And that why, that why we continue this war.

But the key which can stop this war is the unity of all world. We have make pressure, political pressure, sanction pressure, and please, weapon deliverance to Ukraine within to fight. Not just for our city, not just for our country. We're fighting for exactly the same world, for same principles. It's this war can touch anyone, everyone, everyone in the European Union, in Europe, and can touch everyone in the world.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

GORANI: And that was the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko along with his brother vowing to stay in the city and defend it.

Still ahead, as Russia's invasion grinds on, Ukraine's president is pleading for more help. Addressing the council of Europe later today. Details on that next.

[03:30:00]

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GORANI: Recapping the latest on our top story. Russia and Ukraine are expected to hold another round of diplomatic talks later today. Officials on both sides have signaled that they are making some progress. But, so far, negotiations have pretty much completely failed to yield any major breakthroughs.

In Ukraine, the fighting rages on. This video is from the besieged city of Mariupol and it shows Russian tanks firing right into the city.

Officials say hundreds of thousands of civilians are trapped in Mariupol still. And aid workers say food, water, and medicine are running out fast. But heavy fighting has prevented humanitarian convoys from reaching the city.

Meanwhile, Russia has expanded its offensive into Western Ukraine Sunday, carrying out a very deadly strike on a military base that is just 25 kilometers from the border with Poland, which is a NATO ally. Ukrainian officials say at least 35 people were killed and more than 130 injured.

In the coming hours, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to address a special session of the Council of Europe. He was invited to speak to the group as it begins its two-day extraordinary session on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

CNN's Natasha Bertrand joins us from Brussels with more on what Zelenskyy is expected to say, and also at this stage of the Russian invasion, how European countries are thinking of maybe adapting their strategy and their response, Natasha?

NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN REPORTER: Yeah, Hala.

[03:34:59]

BERTRAND: So, President Zelensky today is expected to reiterate the message that he has been sending for the last few weeks and months, which is that Ukraine wants to be a member of the European Union. And, of course, a couple weeks ago, we saw that Zelenskyy actually filled out a formal application to become a member.

The European Union have met on that last week over two days, and they decided to not actually fast-track that E.U. membership application as Zelensky had wanted.

So, obviously, he has been disappointed. The country feels at this moment that it will be very, very important for them to be a member of the E.U., if not only symbolically, because of the message that it would send to Russia during this war.

But the E.U. has said, look, we can't fast-track this right now, this is not a process that we really have in place, and it's not really a priority for us at this point, we believe that the priority is to give you a lethal aid and humanitarian assistance that you need in order to fend off the Russians.

But Zelenskyy has been very passionate about this. He spoke to the European Parliament a few weeks ago and gave this passionate speech about why Ukraine fills European about how they are fighting not only for themselves but also for the future of Europe.

And so, what they're going to be hearing today from Zelenskyy is likely more of that as well as, of course, the urgency of the European countries sending more lethal aid to Ukraine to help them fight off the Russians as well as, of course, economic assistance and humanitarian aid.

But the E.U. has really stepped up in terms of imposing sanctions on Russia. That right now seems to be a strategy, along with the United States. They are kind of trying to squeeze Russian President Vladimir Putin and his inner circle.

They announced just last week that they're imposing a new round of sanctions on Russia. They are revoking the most favored nation status in terms of imposing new restrictions on that trade relationship with Russia. They also banning the export of luxury goods from the European Union as well as banning many imports in the iron and steel sector from Russia into Europe. And importantly, they're also proposing a ban on additional European investments on Russia's energy sector, essentially saying that the Europeans need to step away from that dependence on Russian energy, on Russian oil and gas.

And so, they, in that sense, understand that this is one of Russia's most important sectors and if they impose new sanctions on the energy sector, then that could really have an impact here. But, of course, the sanctions that they imposed need to be increasing, right? So far, they have not really had an impact on Putin's calculus here. He has continued to war. If anything, it has become more brutal.

So, anything that comes now, I think Zelenskyy is going to say, we will need to be even tougher. And, of course, the weaponry here is really key. They feel that they need that in order to continue fighting effectively against the Russians. Hala?

GORANI: All right, Natasha Bertrand in Brussels, thanks very much.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will host Nordic and Baltic leaders for a summit on European defense in the coming days. Representatives will meet in London Tuesday to discuss -- quote -- "shoring of Europeans security and increasing defensive military support to Ukraine," according to a statement. The leaders are also expected to talk about joint military exercises in the high north and Baltic regions.

And, inside Russia, dissent, not tolerated. More than 850 people were detained in anti-war protests across Russia on Sunday, according to an independent human rights group. It says Russian security forces are no longer detaining, just protesters. They also trying to identify -- quote -- "unreliable people" in the places where demonstrations were announced. Overall, the group says almost 15,000 anti-war protesters have been detained in Russia since the invasion of Ukraine began.

And that's it for me for now -- for me for now, I should say. Rosemary Church in Atlanta picks up our breaking news coverage. Rosemary?

ROSEMARY CHURCH, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you so much, Hala, for your reporting. Appreciate it.

Well, some Ukrainians living abroad are now returning home to fight for their country. We will meet one such family in the U.S. after the short break.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CHURCH (on camera): Well, many Ukrainians are facing an increasingly dire situation, cut off from humanitarian aid, and running out of supplies. But Ukrainians around the world are coming together to help.

CNN's Paul Vercammen is at a Los Angeles church with that story.

PAUL VERCAMMEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Here at St. Andrew Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Los Angeles, they are rallying for the people of Ukraine. They're collecting supplies, medical supplies here, some supplies for soldiers over there, including thermal underwear because it's so cold. They put together other kits. If you look behind me, they've got toiletries, hand sanitizer.

Now, there's about 14,000 Ukrainian-Americans here in the Los Angeles area, and the scene is being played out at other Ukrainian churches. And the father here is what is astounding. It is not only are the Ukrainians helping out so much, but other people in the community from all walks of life are also contributing.

VASILE SAUCIUR, REVEREND, CATHEDRAL OF ST. VLADIMIR UKRANIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH: Well, it started so small. And then, I am overwhelmed with phone calls. People asking about Ukraine and crying over the phone and supporting Ukraine. Whatever they can. Clothing, medical supplies, money, everything. They -- prayers as well.

VERCAMMEN: And the father said, as people have been reaching out to him, they asked him, what is it that you need in Ukraine right now? And he said, think of it like camping, like backpack amping. Anything that you would take on that sort of trip is what people could use right now in Ukraine.

Reporting from Los Angeles, I'm Paul Vercammen. Now, back to you.

CHURCH (on camera): Thanks for that report.

And we, of course, have heard countless stories of courage in Ukraine since Russia's invasion began. Every day, people bravely staying behind to fight for their country. And now, some Ukrainians living overseas are returning home to lend their support.

CNN's Gary Tuchman spoke with the family in the U.S., worried for their loved ones who chose to go back to their native Ukraine.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

GARY TUCHMAN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At this house in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, these Ukrainian-American family members give each other comfort. All of these adults left Ukraine for America more than two decades ago. But once this war started, things changed.

Yuliya Penchak's husband, Andriy, has gone back to Ukraine. Gone back to help his native country.

YULIYA PENCHAK, UKRAINIAN-AMERICAN: I don't have any more tears left. I feel like I've cried them all out. It's very emotional.

TUCHMAN (voice-over): But Yuliya's husband did not go alone. Her 62- year-old father, Valentin, flew with him. And they both met up with her younger brother, Arsen (ph), who recently married.

So, in this room, (INAUDIBLE) Penchak are the parents of Yuliya's husband. And Yuliya's mother, Oleskandra Drobakha, has her husband and son in Ukraine. It's complicated. And sometimes, overwhelming.

TUCHMAN (voice-over): Before Yuliya's husband, Andriy, flew to Ukraine, he was presented with helmets and bulletproof vests by one of the local police departments. Andriy and his two relatives are now part of supply distribution network to Ukrainians.

Yuliya, her family and friends arrange for cases of supplies to be flown into Poland several days a week. Andriy and his two family members pick up the supplies and drive them across the border to Ukraine and distribute them. They also drive refugees from Ukraine to Poland.

PENCHAK: We have packed things like armored vests, helmets, gauze, tourniquets, two-way radios, medicine.

TUCHMAN (voice-over): Their primary location for delivering the items? The Ukrainian military base that was just hit by deadly Russian attack. When she heard about the attack, Yuliya was extremely frightened.

PENCHAK: I started falling. I couldn't think. I couldn't think. I feel like I had white (ph) noise in my ears.

TUCHMAN (voice-over): A short time later, she heard from her husband. They were all okay. But the fears for her family, which include cousins in the Ukrainian Army and her fears for Ukrainian civilians, have resulted in --

PENCHAK: Panic attacks, unfortunately. Just unbelievable sadness and sorrow for the suffering.

TUCHMAN (voice-over): Yuliya and Andriy's (ph) three children are nine, seven, and three. Their parents are very (INAUDIBLE) with them about what is going on.

(On camera): Do you think your dad is brave?

ZLATA PENCHAK, FATHER IN UKRAINE: Yes.

TUCHMAN (on camera): Are you worried about him?

Z. PENCHAK: Yes.

TUCHMAN (on camera): You're a good daughter to be worried about him, but he promised he will be okay, right?

Z. PENCHAK: Yes.

TUCHMAN (on camera): And that makes you feel good?

Z. PENCHAK: Yes.

TUCHMAN (voice-over): Before we leave, Yuliya tries to call her husband. But there's no answer. She knows he's probably just fine. Once again, she worries and hopes for a call back soon.

Y. PENCHAK: I will keep watching Ukrainian soldiers telling us that they're winning and telling us that everything will be over soon. So, this is what gives me strength, and I don't fall spiral into this panic.

TUCHMAN (voice-over): Do you believe that in your heart, that it will be over soon and victory will be Ukraine's?

Y. PENCHAK: Victory will be Ukraine's. I believe that will all my heart. I hope it will be over soon.

Andrey’s yacht, bought with money from Murmansk businesses, is seized by Italy

The highest mast on Andrey Melnichenko’s eight decks large yacht “A” is taller than Hotel Arktika (Azimut) in the centre of Murmansk.

It was unlikely at the Seven Skies bar on the top floor of Hotel Arktika Andrey got the idea to build the world’s tallest sailing yacht. From the bar, however, guests can overlook the central harbour of Murmansk, Russia’s largest port in the north where he is majority shareholder.

The 19-floor Hotel Arktika is 72 meters, 19 meter shorter than the 91 meter tall mid-mast on board sailing yacht “A”.

Together, the eight decks and the tallest mast, the vessel is three times higher than Alosha, the WWII monument on the hill just outside Murmansk city centre. The 35,5 meter tall statue is the highest in northern Russia.

It is also war that brought an end to Andrey Melnichenko’s ownership of the 468-feet superyacht valued at €417 million.

Italian police boarded the superyacht on Friday in the port of Trieste as part of the Western crackdown on wealthy oligarchs linked with dictator Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/italy-seizes-russian-oligarch-melnichenkos-sailing-yacht-2022-03-12/] reported.

Andrey Melnichenko os by the European Union described to be one of the most influential in Putin’s circle of Russian businesspeople.

“On 24 February 2022, in the aftermath of the initial stages of Russian aggression against Ukraine, Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko, along with other 36 businesspeople, met with President Vladimir Putin and other members of the Russian government to discuss the impact of the course of action in the wake of Western sanctions,” the EU Council writes in its March 9 decision[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32022D0397] to sanction the oligarch.

On the Kola Peninsula, Andrey Melnichenko owns EuroChem’s mining and metallurgy subsidiary Kovdorskiy GOK. Being one of the top-ten agrochemical companies globally by nutrient capacity, big money comes from producing nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers. In Kovdor, the company also mines iron ore.

Andrey Melnichenko’s assets also includes Siberian Coal Energy Company (SUEK), the leading coal producer in Russia and owner of 75% of the shares in Murmansk Commercial Sea Port, as reported by the Barents Observer[https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/industry-and-energy/2017/01/company-boosts-control-over-murmansk-coal-exports] in 2017.

Russian Billionaires Reshape Their Fortunes While They Can

(Bloomberg) -- In the dark of night on March 4, Italian police in the Ligurian port of Imperia encircled a 215-foot superyacht belonging to Russia’s fourth-richest person, Alexey Mordashov.

The European Union had sanctioned the billionaire on Feb. 28, days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. His extensive holdings in Europe -- including “Lady M,” with its swimming pool and beauty salon -- were seemingly frozen by authorities.

Mordashov, however, had already made moves of his own.

The same day the steel tycoon was sanctioned, he shifted[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-02/alexey-mordashov-shifts-control-of-nordgold-stake-to-wife] control of a roughly $1.1 billion stake in London-based mining company Nordgold to his wife, Marina Mordashova. He also moved[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-05/russian-tycoon-mordashov-transfers-1-4-billion-tui-stake] a chunk of his $1.7 billion stake in holiday tour-business TUI AG from a Cyprus holding company to one incorporated in the British Virgin Islands.

As lawmakers worldwide ratchet up pressure on some of Russia’s elite as a way to pressure President Vladimir Putin, they’ve often pointed to blocked superyachts[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-12/italy-seizes-580-million-russian-superyacht-over-sanctions], luxury real estate and sports clubs as signs their efforts are working.

But the truth is murkier -- revealed in arcane corporate filings that can take days before becoming public. They show Russian billionaires shifting ownership stakes, ditching board roles and giving up control, all part of a race to get ahead of officials in the U.S., U.K. and EU and restructure their assets while they still can.

One example is Mikhail Fridman, who was sanctioned by the EU alongside Mordashov and his business partner Petr Aven. Filings show he ceded[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-10/sanctioned-russian-billionaire-fridman-cedes-u-k-company-stakes] control two days later of at least three companies in the U.K., where he’s not sanctioned. He transferred those shares to a former employee at LetterOne, the investment firm he co-founded.

The list goes on -- and includes those subject to a new round[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-09/new-eu-sanctions-hit-wealthy-russians-including-race-driver] of EU sanctions this week.

Vadim Moshkovich cut his stake in agricultural conglomerate Ros Agro Plc to below 50% before the sanctions hit. Andrey Melnichenko withdrew as a beneficiary of his roughly $17 billion stake in fertilizer producer EuroChem and thermal coal supplier Suek effective March 9 -- the day he and others were sanctioned.

That didn’t stop Italian authorities from seizing Melnichenko’s $580 million-euro superyacht in Trieste, Italy. There is no justification for Melnichenko to be on an EU sanctions list, and he will be challenging the measures, a spokesman for Melnichenko said in an email Saturday after the seizure was announced.

Read More: Italy Seizes $580 Million Russian Superyacht Over Sanctions[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-12/italy-seizes-580-million-russian-superyacht-over-sanctions]

Sanctions require compliance from industries, and companies have to quickly dig through corporate ownership layers to find, freeze and report relevant accounts. In the U.S., they share findings with the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC.

It may take time for financial institutions to identify associated accounts of a sanctioned individual that aren’t already widely known, said Howard Mendelsohn, chief client officer at Kharon, which uses technology and experts to construct the network of relationships around sanctioned parties.

Shuffle Time

Someone who is sanctioned can use that as a window to hire lawyers, consider ownership changes and otherwise move assets around, he said.

“They might be thinking, ‘I might have a little time here before anyone figures out what all my companies are, especially those that are majority-owned,’” Mendelsohn said. “I’m going to shuffle. I’m going to take my daughter, my wife, my employee or employees, and I’m going to put this stuff in other names. It’s going to show up and it’s going to be documented that I’m not the majority owner.”

In the U.S., there’s a clear incentive to drop majority control: OFAC’s so-called 50% rule.

It states that property or interests owned by sanctioned individuals must be blocked if people named on the government’s list have a 50% or greater aggregate stake. That makes divesting shares a popular maneuver to get under that threshold.

The U.S. Treasury has the power to name and sanction spouses or adult children of sanctioned individuals under a 2021 executive order.

Prior Shifts

It’s not the first time Russian tycoons have resorted to shuffling assets. Oil mogul Gennady Timchenko sold[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-16/russian-billionaire-cut-stakes-beyond-gunvor-before-sanctions] an almost 50% stake in a Finnish petroleum distributor days before being sanctioned following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Oleg Deripaska was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2018[https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0338]. To ensure aluminum company En+ Group International PJSC’s was removed from OFAC’s list, he shrunk his stake to 45% from 70% through a complex array of transactions involving a share tender to a state-owned bank, stock transfers and charitable donations.

OFAC lifted sanctions on En+, citing that the majority of board directors were independent.

“When you’re talking about, say, a Russian oligarch, if Oleg Deripaska still has a 33% voting stake, would you vote against him?” said Eric Sohn, director at Dow Jones Risk & Compliance.

Transactions have multiplied in recent days as Russia’s richest sense a closing window. For some, it may be too late.

Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea Football Club, said[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-02/billionaire-abramovich-says-he-s-selling-chelsea-football-club] on March 2 that the storied sports franchise was up for sale. Yet a week later, the U.K. sanctioned him and six other Russians, leaving the team in limbo.

As for Mordashov, the major shareholder of one of Russia’s biggest steelmakers, he’s called the Ukraine conflict “a tragedy”[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-01/russian-billionaires-war-doubts-go-nowhere-as-eu-freezes-assets] and said he doesn’t understand why the EU imposed sanctions on him.

A spokesperson for Mordashov confirmed the recent share transfers, declining to comment further. He’s worth $19.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Russia’s ultra-wealthy have lost more than $90 billion in the fallout from the Ukraine invasion. With no letup in sight, wealthy and connected Russians are likely trying to protect and shield their interests as authorities’ targets get broader, Kharon’s Mendelsohn said.

“If they’re not listed now, they’re definitely anxious,” he said.

‘The warnings are very clear’: Council adopt climate change plan

Wollongong Council unanimously adopted its Climate Change Adaptation Plan (CCAP) at Monday night’s meeting.

The plan outlines the key risks the city is facing as a result of climate change while putting in place steps that can guide the council in responding to risks and reducing the potential impacts.

Former Wollongong councillor and Illawarra Green George Takacs spoke to the council at the beginning of its meeting, urging them to see the plan as the starting point, rather than an end point.

“Climate change is something that will be with us for eternity,” he said.

“It’s not something that will be done and dusted after tonight.

“Council must integrate climate change adaptation into everything it does otherwise it runs the risk of adapting on one and maladapting on the other.”

Mr Takacs also called on the council to avoid making “shrines of concrete” as well as avoiding synthetic turf and playing surfaces which can “easily” raise surface temperatures about 50 degrees.

The CCAP focused on 73 actions for council to implement, 27 of which are expected to be delivering over the next four years.

These actions are broken into short (2021-2030), medium (2030-2050) and long-term (2050—2070) goals.

The goals are divided into a number of categories including heat, emergency and bushfire management, flood plain management, coastal management to minimise the impacts of rising sea levels and more intense storms, and urban greening.

Greens councillor Mithra Cox said she was encouraged by the council’s adoption of the plan, but she said climate change was an issue which is already causing havoc across the country.

“The report is bleak, unambiguous and terrifying,” Cr Cox said.

“Too many people, including people here on council put climate change into a little box … it frustrates me no end when [bushfires and floods] are referred to as unprecedented, unexpected or one in 1000 year events – they’re not unexpected, scientists have been telling us this is to be expected, climate change if fuelling these weather events.

“The warnings are very clear. It takes time to adapt, it will take decades to adapt.”

Pressure of rogue construction sites

Wollongong Mayor Gordon Bradbery pushed through a motion to pressure building sites to better manage sediment and run-off, especially during rain events.

This came in the wake of weeks of rain which led to waterways throughout the region being filled with waste from construction sites, with the orange-stained rock shelf in Wombarra as a result of run-off from the Wombarra Vista townhouse construction site one of the most alarming examples.

“There is the situation at Wombarra, but it was multiplied many times through our region last week,” Cr Bradbery said.

“It needs to be brought to the attention of the building industry.

“There is a moral obligation on those who stripped the land of vegetation to think beyond their development and their obligation to the community – it’s selfishness on their part.

“You just don’t clear a block of land and then walk away from it and wait for months until construction starts.”

Wombarra Vista townhouse construction site was fined $8000 in accordance with NSW Government‘s Protection of the Environment Operations Act, the maximum penalty.

Councillor Cath Blakey said the sanction was “pretty cheap” and asked for Council to write to the Environment Minister Matt Kean to seek an increase in the penalty that was “appropriate to the community’s expectation of seriousness”.

The mayor agreed with Cr Blakey and the motion was unanimously passed.

Council shows support for Ukraine

Cr Figliomeni put forward an emergency motion on the eve of the meeting calling for council to express its support for the people of Ukraine during the ongoing conflict with Russia.

The independent councillor asked for the council to condemn the violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty by Russian forces and communicate the stance to the appropriate embassies.

“The world has witnessed the most horrendous destabilisation event in the last 70 years,” Cr Figliomeni said.

“The West has been complicit akin to Nero playing the fiddle while Rome burnt.

“It’s the least and the little we can do to show our support to the Ukrainians in our community and the Ukrainian people.”

The motion was carried unanimously with a number of councillors speaking in support of it, even though councillor David Martin’s assessment of the conflict was, by his own admission, depressing.

“We shouldn’t really take on international affairs,” the Labor councillor said.

“But it wouldn’t take much for this to turn into World War III which we may not come out alive quite frankly and we might not be here for our next meeting which is a depressing thought for a Monday night.”

Pedestrian safety in Austinmer

Austinmer local Katherine Watson addressed council at the start of the meeting about community concerns regarding the intersection where Hill St meets with Balfour Rd and Railway Ave in the northern Illawarra suburb.

Ms Watson said she wanted infrastructure put in place to make it safer for people, particularly children, to more safely walk to and from school, the train station and the nearby Sublime Point walking track.

Three other concerned Austinmer residents attended the meeting in support of Ms Watson who indicated it was an issue the community has wanted to address for more than a decade.

Ms Watson said the group would like to see more signage and footpaths put in around the area as well as raised pedestrian crossing or roundabout as “something motorists would see and know pedestrians were around”.

Summary

Another oligarch has had his yacht taken away, this time by authorities in Spain.

The 85-metre (279ft) superyacht Valerie, worth an estimated £140m, was seized in Barcelona where it has been docked since February.

It is believed to belong to Sergei Chemezov, a former KGB officer who heads state conglomerate Rostec, two sources told Reuters.

“Today we seized – the technical term is provisionally immobilised – a yacht belonging to one of the principal oligarchs,” Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez said on La Sexta television on Monday. “We are talking about a yacht that we estimate is worth $140m.”

Beijing urges 'maximum restraint'

Beijing has released its readout of the high level meeting between the US national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, and China’s foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, in Rome overnight.

The meeting was long planned as a follow-up to the bilateral talk between Xi Jinping and Joe Biden last November, but came amid reports that Russia was requesting China supply it with weapons for its assault on Ukraine. The reports, citing US officials, were met with anger from Beijing, and were expected to be a key focus of the meeting with the US expected to urge China not to give Russia the support.

Beijing’s read out of the meeting, released a few hours ago, said Yang had urged all parties to exercise “maximum restraint”, protect civilians, and prevent a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, noting Beijing had sent humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. It also reiterated messaging from Beijing stressing there were “legitimate concerns” on all sides which should be listened to.

It said China advocated for respecting the “sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries”, and the history of the Ukraine issues “should be straightened out”.

“China is committed to promoting peace talks, and the international community should jointly support the Russia-Ukraine peace talks, achieve substantive results as soon as possible, and promote the cooling of the situation as soon as possible,” it said.

It also did not specifically refer to the claims of Russia’s weapons request but did reference accusations its foreign ministry had made on Monday that the US claims were false, and designed to smear China.

The US side said the meeting was “an intense seven-hour session, reflecting the gravity of the moment, as well as our commitment to maintaining open lines of communication”, but did not detail discussions about the weapons reports.

Russia has lined up more than 40,000 Syrian militiamen to join the war in Ukraine pn rthe promise of a “salary and privileges”, according to the respected Syrian Observatory for Human Rights[https://www.syriahr.com/en/243086/].

The SOHR, which has been reporting on the war in Syria for years, said no Syrian fighters had reached the front but around 400 were undergoing training in camps in Russia close to the Ukraine border.

“So far, more than 40,000 fighters have signed up for enlistment,” said SOHR, adding that these are not “volunteers” but have signed up on promises to receive “a salary and privileges”.

SOHR said recruitment is underway in Damascus and Aleppo through various Syrian government structures that have been co-opted for years by the Russian military system in Syria.

Russian forces have been fighting for years on the side of the Assad regime against rebels in the Syrian civil war.

The SOHR report tallies with comments made in the last few hours[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/14/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-talks-resume-blockade-black-sea-coast-zelenskiy-putin-live?page=with:block-622ffc748f080ca36791946d#block-622ffc748f080ca36791946d] by a Ukrainian government adviser that Russia might try to bring Syrian fighters into the country because it was suffering heavy casualities.

War should be over by May when Russia runs out of troops – Zelenskiy adviser

The war in Ukraine should be over by May because Russia will run out of resources to keep the invasion going, Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, has claimed.

Citing a video published by several Ukrainian media outlets, Reuters reports that Arestovich said the exact timing would depend on how much resources the Kremlin was willing to commit to the campaign.

“I think that no later than in May, early May, we should have a peace agreement, maybe much earlier, we will see, I am talking about the latest possible dates,” Arestovich said.

“We are at a fork in the road now: there will either be a peace deal struck very quickly, within a week or two, with troop withdrawal and everything, or there will be an attempt to scrape together some, say, Syrians for a round two and, when we grind them too, an agreement by mid-April or late April.”

A “completely crazy” scenario could also involve Russia sending fresh conscripts after a month of training, he said.

Still, even once peace is agreed, small tactical clashes could remain possible for a year, according to Arestovich, although Ukraine insists on the complete removal of Russian troops from its territory.

I’ve been looking at Zelenskiy’s claims about Russian casualties in Ukraine now exceeding those suffered in the Kremlin’s two wars in Chechnya.

Ukraine reckons more than 12,000 Russians[https://kyivindependent.com/uncategorized/ukraines-military-updates-report-on-russian-losses/] have been killed in the current conflict. The Kremlin is estimating the number at around 500.

According to some rapid reseach, the official estimate is that 5,732 Russians were killed in losing the first Chechen war between 1994 and 1996. Some estimates say the figure is more than double that.

The official figure for the second war, which was prosecuted by Vladimir Putin between 1999 and 2009 and ended in “victory” for the Kremlin, is that 7,425 were killed, although that includes more than 1,000 Chechen police.

Here’s the final part of Zelenskiy’s address, in which he updates Ukrainians on his diplomaic efforts and says talks contin ue on Tuesday:

On March 14, we managed to evacuate 3,806 Ukrainians from [encircled] cities and towns. Our convoy of trucks with 100 tons of much needed humanitarian aid for Mariupol is still held up in Berdyansk. For a third day. However, we will keep trying to deliver food, water, and medication to the people of Mariupol. Every aggressive action of the invaders only pushes the world for more sanctions. I spoke to Ursula von der Leyen, Andrzej Duda, Xavier Bettel. There’s 100% of mutual understanding. I spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Bennett as part of negotiations effort to finish this war as soon as possible with honest peace. Our delegation has also worked on it at the talks with the Russian side. Pretty well, as it was reported to me. But we will see. They will continue tomorrow.

Cabinet of ministers approved a support package for the economy and businesses so that people had work where it is safe. We are launching a fiscal reform. Instead of an added-value tax and income tax, we will introduce a 2% turnover tax and simplified accounting. For small businesses, individual entrepreneurs, we make the payment of the unified tax voluntary. If you can, pay. You can’t, no questions. Secondly, maximum deregulation of business. We cancel all state inspections for all businesses so that they keep working and everyplace where there is no fighting continued to live. We have only on condition: You have to ensure your business operates within the Ukrainian law. And it’s only the beginning of our fiscal reform.

[In the end he said he signed an order to award Ukrainian soldiers]

More from Zelenskiy’s latest address, in which he also claims that Russia has lost more troops in Ukraine than it did in two Chechen wars. “What for?” he asks.

As we noted earlier[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/14/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-talks-resume-blockade-black-sea-coast-zelenskiy-putin-live?page=with:block-622fdbb38f080ca3679192ee#block-622fdbb38f080ca3679192ee], he also thanked the Russian TV worker who interrupted a broadcast on Channel One on Monday night with an anti-war protest.

[In Ukrainian]: Our brave defenders continue causing the Russian forces devastating losses. Very soon, the number of downed Russian helicopters will reach 100. They have already lost 80 military places, hundreds of tanks, thousands of other military vehicles and equipment. In 19 days, the Russian army had more soldiers killed than in two bloody wars in Chechnya. What for?

[In Russian] I’m thankful to those Russians who don’t stop trying to deliver the truth, who are fighting against disinformation and tell real facts to their friends and families, and personally to that woman who went in the studio of Channel One with an anti-war poster. Those who aren’t afraid to protest. As long as your country isn’t completely closed from the rest of the world, turning into a huge North Korea, you have to fight, you don’t have to miss your chance.

[In Ukrainian] The EU has approved the fourth package of sanctions against Russia. I’m sure it’s not the last one. We are working with partners on new restrictions that will be imposed against Russia. Every person who is responsible for the war, who is responsible for destroying a democracy and repressions against people. Everyone will get a retaliation from the world. And it’s only the beginning. Accountability for war crimes is inevitable. Accountability for deliberately manufactured humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine is inevitable. The whole world is seeing what’s happening in Mariupol, Kharkiv, Sumy, Okhtyrka, Hostomel, Irpin. All our partners are informed about crimes of the occupants against civilians and local governments in Kherson and Zaporizhia regions.

'Choose dignity': Zelenskiy urges Russian troops to surrender

Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has used his latest address to urge Russian troops to choose giving up arms over the “shame” of continuing with the war.

Speaking in Russian, Zelenskiy said: “On behalf of the Ukrainian people, we give you a chance to live. If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you as humans have to be treated: with dignity. The way you have not been treated in your army. And the way your army doesn’t treat our people. Choose.”

He also said the war had become a “nightmare” for the Russians,and claimed that their troops were fleeing the battlefield and leaving arms and equipment for the Ukrainians.

Here is the first part of his speech. It’s a long address so I’ll post the rest in two more chunks.

Free people of the free country, the 19th day of our resistance has come to end. Another hard day that made us closer to the victory and peace for Ukraine. As before, the enemy is perplexed. They didn’t expect such resistance. They believed their propaganda that lied about us for decades.

They still can’t recover but have begun realizing that they won’t achieve anything by war. Their soldiers know it. Their officers understand it. They flee from the battlefield, leaving behind their vehicles and equipment. We take the trophies and use them for defence of Ukraine. Russian forces have de-facto become a supplier of equipment for our army. They couldn’t imagine it in a nightmare.

[In Russian] I want to tell Russian soldiers, those who have already entered our lands and those who are only being sent to fight against us. Russian conscripts, please, listen to me attentively. Russian officers, you have already understood everything. You won’t be able to take anything from Ukraine. You will take lives – you are many – but yours will be taken too.

What are you dying for? I know, you want to survive. We hear in your intercepted calls what you really think of this war, of this shame, and of your state. Your conversations with each other, your calls home to your families, we hear everything. We make conclusions. We know who you are. That’s why I offer you a choice: On behalf of the Ukrainian people, we give you a chance to live. If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you as humans have to be treated: with dignity. The way you have not been treated in your army. And the way your army doesn’t treat our people. Choose.

Our world affairs editor Julian Borger has just filed more on the US-China talks in Rome, saying that Washington fears Beijing has already decided to supply aid to Russia.

He writes:

China has already decided to provide Russia with economic and financial support during its war on Ukraine[https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine] and is contemplating sending military supplies such as armed drones, US officials fear.

The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, laid out the US case against Russia’s invasion in an “intense” seven-hour meeting in Rome with his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, pointing out that Moscow had feigned interest in diplomacy while preparing for invasion, and also that the Russian military was clearly showing signs of frailty.

“The key here is first to get China to recalculate and re-evaluate their position. We see no sign of that re-evaluation,” said a US official familiar with the discussions. “They’ve already decided that they’re going to provide economic and financial support, and they underscored that today. The question really is whether they will go further.”

Russia-Ukraine talks will continue on Tuesday, says Zelenskiy

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest address on Monday that negotiations with Russia are to continue on Tuesday.

Zelenskiy also said he spoke with Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett as part of a negotiation effort to end the war with Russia “with a fair peace”.

“Our delegation also worked on this in negotiations with the Russian party,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. “Pretty good, as I was told. But let’s see. They will continue tomorrow.”

Marina Ovsyannikova also held up a placard[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/russian-tv-employee-interrupts-news-broadcast-marina-ovsyannikova] saying “Don’t believe the propaganda.

Still on economics, and the price of oil slipped more than 5% during Monday’s session and could come under more pressure in Tuesday’s trading. The prospect of more constructive talks between Russia and Ukraine was the reason, according to analysts.

Brent futures – the international benchmark – fell 5.1% to settle at $106.90 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 5.8% to settle at $103.01.

Good chart here shows how much it has fallen from the recent peak last Monday:

A sovereign default basically means that a country can’t repay the debts it owes on bonds sold on the open market. As you might expect if you didn’t pay your debts, it means borrowing new money is much harder and way more expensive. Although given reports about requests for arms supplies from China, Russia might find a lender across its eastern border.

The IMF chief has repeated her view[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/russian-default-on-debts-no-longer-improbable-says-imf-head] that a Russian default was not “improbable” but would not cause another 2008-style financial crash.

Summary

Hello, I’m Martin Farrer taking over the blog from Lois Beckett. Thanks very much for joining us and to make sure we’re all on the same page here are the main developments you need to know about:

* The United States told allies that Russia has requested military equipment from China, including missiles, drones, and armoured vehicles, and that China “responded positively” to the request, the Financial Times reports. China denies the story.[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/us-will-try-to-convince-china-not-to-supply-arms-to-russia-at-key-rome-meeting] The US is believed to have told Beijing it would be a “historic mistake” during an “intense” session of talks in Rome on Monday.

* An employee of Russian interrupted a Russian state TV broadcastby shouting “No to war”[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/russian-tv-employee-interrupts-news-broadcast-marina-ovsyannikova] and holding a sign that read “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” The poster held up by Marina Ovsyannikova on Monday evening also said, in English, “Russians against the war”.

* “Almost all” of the Russian advances in Ukraine “remain stalled”, a senior US defence official said during a background briefing, CNN reports. Russian forces moving on Kyiv have not appreciably progressed over the weekend. A close ally of Putin, national guard chief Viktor Zolotov, blamed[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/14/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-talks-resume-blockade-black-sea-coast-zelenskiy-putin-live?page=with:block-622f28658f08d64fa95ebacd#block-622f28658f08d64fa95ebacd] the slower than expected progress on what he claimed were far-right Ukrainian forces hiding behind civilians.

* US president Joe Biden is considering travelling to Europe for in-person meetings with Nato allies, Reuters reports[https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-may-go-europe-meet-allies-over-russia-ukraine-source-2022-03-14/]. Biden could meet other leaders in Brussels on 23 March and then travel to Poland, the report said.

* A convoy of more than 160 cars departed from Mariupol today, local officials said, in what appeared to be the first successful attempt to evacuate civilians from the encircled Ukrainian city. After several days of failed attempts to deliver supplies to Mariupol and provide safe passage out for trapped civilians, the city council said[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/14/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-talks-resume-blockade-black-sea-coast-zelenskiy-putin-live?page=with:block-622f4fd98f08928a93adf678#block-622f4fd98f08928a93adf678] a local ceasefire was holding and the convoy had left for the city of Zaporizhzhia.

* The mayor of Ukraine’s frontline city of Kharkiv said the city had been under constant attack by Russian forces, Reuters reports. Speaking on national television, Ihor Terekhov said Russian troops had fired at central districts[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/14/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-talks-resume-blockade-black-sea-coast-zelenskiy-putin-live?page=with:block-622f7a118f080ca367918e11#block-622f7a118f080ca367918e11] causing an unspecified number of casualties.

* A Russian airstrike hit a residential building in Kyiv as Moscow’s forces stepped up their brutal campaign to capture Ukraine’s capital and other major cities. One person was found dead in the nine-storey apartment building, officials said, with three more people hospitalised as air raid sirens sounded in the capital[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/14/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-talks-resume-blockade-black-sea-coast-zelenskiy-putin-live?page=with:block-622f2b668f08527b36856514#block-622f2b668f08527b36856514] and other cities hours before Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were set to resume talks.

* The Antonovaircraft plant in Kyiv was shelled by Russian forces, the Kyiv city administration said in an update[https://t.me/KyivCityOfficial/2557] on its official Telegram account on Monday morning. At least two people were killed and seven injured, it said.

* Ukrainian authorities have denied accusations by Russia after a Ukrainian missile allegedly exploded in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk killing 20 civilians. Ukrainian military spokesman Leonid Matyukhin said the missile, that carried warhead shrapnel, was in fact a Russian rocket. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/14/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-talks-resume-blockade-black-sea-coast-zelenskiy-putin-live?page=with:block-622f71418f08963051184acc#block-622f71418f08963051184acc] The Russian and Ukrainian claims cannot be independently verified.

* There are reports that Russian forces blew up explosives at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s parliament earlier said Russian troops[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/14/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-talks-resume-blockade-black-sea-coast-zelenskiy-putin-live?page=with:block-622f63138f080ca367918c5f#block-622f63138f080ca367918c5f] planned to begin “disposal” of ammunition in front of the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe’s largest nuclear power station.

* At least nine people were reportedly killed and nine more wounded in an airstrike on a television tower in Ukraine’s northern Rivne region today. “There are still people under the rubble,” governor Vitaliy Koval said in an online post, Reuters reports.[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/14/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-talks-resume-blockade-black-sea-coast-zelenskiy-putin-live?page=with:block-622f71e08f08963051184ad7#block-622f71e08f08963051184ad7]

* Ninety children have been killed and more than 100 wounded in Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February, the Ukrainian general prosecutor’s office said. “The highest number of victims are in the Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kherson, Mykolayiv and Zhytomyr regions,” it said in a statement.[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/14/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-talks-resume-blockade-black-sea-coast-zelenskiy-putin-live?page=with:block-622f09bb8f087f6d099f6a66#block-622f09bb8f087f6d099f6a66]

* Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said Russian forces were “behaving like terrorists” and Putin had started a “full-scale war” in the centre of Europe that could “become a third world war”. Addressing the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, he said Europe “chose the road of pacifying the aggressor”[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/14/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-talks-resume-blockade-black-sea-coast-zelenskiy-putin-live?page=with:block-622f5c4d8f08928a93adf758#block-622f5c4d8f08928a93adf758] for years instead of “defending the values of democracy, the rule of law and human rights”.

New Zealand says it will take 4,000 family members of its current Ukrainian residents

New Zealand will take 4,000 family members of Ukrainian residents, as part of its humanitarian response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“This is the largest special visa category we have ever established to support an international humanitarian effort,” Immigration Minister Kris Faafoi said.

“Our Ukrainian community in New Zealand has... asked us to help in sheltering their family members who have been forced to flee their homes due to Russia’s unprovoked attack,” he said. “It’s a two-year visa to help people escape the current conflict and to shelter here in the hope they can return home when the war ends.”

The policy will be open for a year and allow the estimated 1,600 Ukrainian-born citizens and residents in New Zealand to sponsor parents, grandparents and adult siblings or adult children and their immediate family who are ordinarily resident in Ukraine to shelter in New Zealand.

More than 2 million people have fled the war in Ukraine.

In this context, Russia “could possibly be planning” a “false-flag” operation, involving a staged attack or discovery of biological or chemical weapons, the defence ministry wrote.

‘Living a nightmare:’ daily life in a Russian-occupied Ukrainian town

My colleague Shaun Walkers and Isobel Koshiw have a report on the situation in Berdyansk, a city in southern Ukraine, which has been controlled by Russian troops for the past two weeks.

Local residents and city officials in occupied cities such as Berdyansk are not facing airstrikes, but they are facing waves of propaganda. The local radio station plays Soviet ballads and Russian pop songs, interspersed with excerpts from Vladimir Putin’s speeches and news items about Ukraine being “liberated from Nazis,” they report.

“We feel like we’re living a nightmare, and we don’t know when this awful dream will end,” said one local councillor in the city, who asked to remain anonymous, citing security fears. “We still can’t believe that this could have happened.”

White House officials are discussing the possibility of US President Joe Biden traveling to Europe in the coming weeks to discuss Russia and Ukraine with allies, two sources familiar with the situation said on Monday.

One plan under discussion calls for Biden to meet with other leaders from the Nato alliance in Brussels on 23 March and then travel to Poland, said one of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity since details were still being finalised.

John Kirby, the spokesman for the Department of Defense, in Washington, DC, a little earlier said that Ukrainian forces “continue to fight bravely and skillfully” and were using to maximum advantage possible their “knowledge and situational awareness” against Russia’s multi-pronged attacks.

Kirby called out “how little progress the Russians have been able to make” in the almost three weeks “they have been at this” and he said that Ukraine was making “good use” of extra military equipment supplied by the US and other nations.

Worth reminding here that the US and its Nato allies have refused to acquiesce to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenzkiy’s repeated pleas to impose a no-fly zone over his skies, because of the risk of wider war precipitated by Nato pilots inevitably being obliged to engage with and shoot down Russian aircraft.

Old Nato fighter jets[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/poland-mig-29-jets-us-ukraine] have also not been supplied to Ukraine after a disagreement between Poland and the US about how such an arrangement would work and what it would risk.

Kirby earlier today said of the relatively limited progress by Russia that: “A lot of this is due to their own stumbles and missteps but a lot of it, a lot of it, is down to the Ukrainian resistance and how adaptive they are proving to be in the field and on the streets.”

The United States has held “intense” high-level talks with China in an effort to try to dissuade Beijing from supplying arms to Russia, at a meeting in Rome which the White House sees as critically important not just for the war in Ukraine[https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine] but also for the future of the global balance of power.

Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, met his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, for all-day talks in the Italian capital on Monday amid reports that Russia[https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia] has asked China for weapons to bolster its faltering invasion of Ukraine.

“It was an intense seven-hour session, reflecting the gravity of the moment, as well as our commitment to maintaining open lines of communication,” a senior administration official said.

“This meeting was not about negotiating specific issues or outcomes, but about a candid direct exchange of views.”

Asked if it had been successful, the official replied: “I suppose it depends on how you define success, but we believe that it is important to keep open lines of communication between the United States and China[https://www.theguardian.com/world/china], especially on areas where we disagree.”

The official would not describe the Chinese response to US arguments in Rome, nor comment on reports that the US had briefed allies on Monday, before the meeting, that Beijing had shown willingness to provide military assistance to Russia.

The Rome meeting had been planned since before the Russian invasion, and covered other topics, including North Korea’s nuclear arsenal and Taiwan.

China reacted angrily to the reports in multiple media outlets citing US officials. Its foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said the US was spreading “malicious disinformation”, with “sinister intentions”, according to translations by journalists in the room.

More on the anti-war protest[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/14/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-talks-resume-blockade-black-sea-coast-zelenskiy-putin-live?page=with:block-622fa1b48f080ca367919061#block-622fa1b48f080ca367919061] on live TV news in Russia by Channel 1 employee Marina Ovsyannikova, who burst on screen holding a sign and had also pre-recorded a statement.

That statement also included her saying of the invasion of Ukraine: “The responsibility of this aggression lies on the shoulders of only one person, Vladimir Putin,” she said, referring to the Russian president.

Ovsyannikova’s father is Ukranian. She also urged Russians to attend anti-war protests in the country to demand an end to the war, despite crackdowns on protesters.

“Only we have the power to stop all this craziness…They cannot put us all in prison,” she said.

OVD-Info rights group said that Ovsyannikova had been detained in Moscow shortly after her protest.

Ovsyannikova could face prison time under newly-introduced Russian legislation which criminalised spreading anything deemed ‘fake news’ about the Russian military. Those found guilty under the law could face up to 15 years in jail.

She could also face legal consequences for encouraging “civil unrest” by telling Russians to protest.

“Wow, that girl is cool,” Kira Yarmysh, spokeswoman for jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny[https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexei-navalny] , wrote on Twitter, Reuters reported.

Russian state television has largely portrayed Russia’s invasion into Ukraine as a defensive “special military operation” aimed at “liberating” Ukraine and protecting citizens in the Donbas area annexed by Russia from what Putin falsely alleges to be Ukrainian “genocide.”

Russia has meanwhile moved to ban Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as well as number of independent Russian outlets that have critically reported on the war.

A Russian TV news staffer launched an audacious lone anti-war protest on live television a little earlier.

The employee, from the Russian state-run Channel One, burst onto the set of the live broadcast of the nightly news on Monday evening, shouting: “Stop the war! No to war!”

The protester, who was identified by Russian media as Channel One employee Marina Ovsyannikova, was also holding a sign in Russian which can be interpreted as: “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.”

Ovsyannikova recorded a separate message beforehand in which she said she was “ashamed to be” a Channel One employee.

“What is happening in Ukraine is a crime and Russia is the aggressor,” said Ovsyannikova, adding that her father was Ukrainian.

It appeared that producers scrambled to cut her off during the live news broadcast.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has announced that it will rule this Wednesday in the case brought by Ukraine that Russia falsely justified its invasion by making accusations that Ukraine had engaged in genocide.

Kyiv filed the case at the ICJ, the United Nations ’ top court, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, demanding that the tribunal order an end to the offensive, Agence France-Presse reports.

AFP further writes that Ukraine:

Accuses Russia of illegally trying to justify its war under an international convention by falsely alleging that Ukraine committed genocide in regions held by pro-Russian separatists.

Russia declined to turn up to a hearing at the United Nations court on 7 March.

The court in The Hague, in the Netherlands, said in a statement it would announce its judgment on Wednesday at 1500 GMT.

The ICJ was set up after World War II to rule on disputes between UN member states, based mainly on treaties and conventions.

Although its rulings are binding, it has no real means to enforce them.

The case is separate from a Ukraine war crimes investigation launched by the International Criminal Court (ICC), a different, intergovernmental, international tribunal, also based in The Hague that typically tries individuals accused of war crimes.

A poignant note of defiance comes from, of all places, the Eurovision song contest.

The organisers of the international annual music competition have announced that Ukraine will participate in this year’s contest, in May, Agence France-Presse reports.

The contest is in Italy’s northern city of Turin this year. Russia had already been disinvited.

AFP further reports:

Eurovision executive producer Simona Martorelli said the delegation from Ukraine had confirmed and sent in all required materials, even on time.

“This is absolutely admirable, given the situation,” Martorelli said.

Ukraine’s pick this year is the Kalush Orchestra, with the rap lullaby Stefania.

Sung to a mother, the song incorporates traditional Ukrainian music and includes the line: “I’ll always find my way home even if all the roads are destroyed.”

Martorelli added that the artists would try to tape a “backup video” required by all those invited to the contest in case they cannot participate live.

“Hopefully they will be able to make it,” Martorelli said.

Eurovision’s executive board decided on 25 February - the day after Russia invaded Ukraine - to exclude Russia from this year’s contest.

The flamboyant annual musical event, which has millions of viewers in Europe and even Australia, is scheduled for 10-14 May in Turin. Organizers said this year’s contest would focus on the theme of peace.

* Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said Russian forces were “behaving like terrorists” and Putin had started a “full-scale war” in the centre of Europe that could “become a third world war”. Addressing the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, he said Europe “chose the road of pacifying the aggressor”[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/14/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-talks-resume-blockade-black-sea-coast-zelenskiy-putin-live?page=with:block-622f5c4d8f08928a93adf758#block-622f5c4d8f08928a93adf758] for years instead of “defending the values of democracy, the rule of law and human rights”.

France has denied it breached European sanctions by continuing to sell military equipment to Russia after its 2014 annexation of Crimea, AFP reports.

Around €152m euros (£128m) of gear had been approved for export since 2015, investigative journalism outfit Disclose reported, citing “top secret” documents and public sources.

Most of the equipment was “thermal cameras to equip more than 1,000 Russian tanks, as well as navigation systems and infrared sensors for fighter planes and helicopters” manufactured by Thales and Safran, companies whose largest shareholder is the French state, Disclose said.

Tanks and aircraft of the types involved had been used in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine since 24 February, it added.

Following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, the European Union imposed arms sanctions. But successive governments “made the most of a chink in the European embargo: it isn’t retroactive,” Disclose charged.

In response, French defence ministry spokesperson Herve Grandjean said:

France complies strictly with its international engagements as concerns exports of military equipment.

Nevertheless, the so-called “grandfather” clause meant that “a contract signed before the annexation of Crimea can run its course... this possibility is clearly provided for in the sanctions regime,” he added.

No new contracts have been made with Russia since 2014. No deliveries have been made to Russia since the beginning of the war in Ukraine.

The US state department spokesman, Ned Price, has been speaking about the Rome meeting between the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi.

The meeting had not finished by the time Price began his briefing, so he did not have a readout on the results, but he said:

The national security adviser and our delegation raised directly and very clearly, our concerns about the PRC’s [People’s Republic of China’s] support to Russia in the wake of the invasion, and the implications that any such support would have for the PRC’s relationship not only with us, but for its relationships around the world, that includes our allies and partners in Europe, and in the Indo Pacific.

A Fox News journalist has been injured outside of Kyiv, Fox News reported on Monday, Maya Yang writes.

According to the network, there are still “very few details but teams on the ground are working as hard as they can to try to gather more information”.

The reports come after the Facebook page of Ukraine’s Prosecutor General, Irina Venediktova, announced on Monday that a British journalist has been seriously wounded in Ukraine and is currently in “intensive care under the supervision of doctors.”

The post added:

This man was not at a military facility, where according to Russian officials, they are constantly targeting. Not being at a military facility, he suffered serious injuries.

The information surrounding the case is being brought to Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau where it “will be properly investigated,” according to the prosecutor.

Accompanying the post is a picture of congressional press accreditation that said “Radio & TV” and “Fox News.” The accreditation features an image of a Caucasian male in a suit with the date “3/31/2022” written underneath.

Air raid sirens sent people running for shelter in Ukraine’s besieged south-eastern city of Mariupol on Sunday as the Russian defence ministry said its forces had advanced 11km (7 miles) and reached five towns north of the city – a claim Ukraine denied.

Drone footage posted by Ukraine’s Azov battalion on social media showed a powerful explosion destroying a high-rise building on Monday.

The footage shared by the special forces unit, which includes members of a far-right political group, also showed fires blazing and thick, dark plumes of smoke rising from several buildings in the city.

No discussions are taking place about the possibility of a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden, Russian state news agency Tass cited Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying.

It comes as multiple sources said White House officials are having early discussions about having President Biden travel to Europe in the coming weeks, as reported by NBC News.

The trip, which would focus on the war in Ukraine and aim to reassure US allies in the region, would come on the heels of visits by several top aides, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

One US official said Brussels is under consideration as a possible location. The White House is also exploring a potential stop in Poland as well as other places in Europe, CNN cited a person familiar with the planning.

Ukraine is working on obtaining some of the seized assets of Russia, said the minister of finance, Sergei Marchenko, during an information telethon.

“I would not like to disclose details right now, but such work is under way. On sanctions, we also joined. We are working with leading investment banks. Already leading banks, in particular Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and other banks have actually stopped operations in Russia, they are withdrawing from assets, and this is quite painful for the aggressor economy,” he said.

Anton Herashchenko, official adviser and a former deputy minister at Ukraine’s ministry of internal affairs, said the total value of the seized assets was equivalent to $415bn (£319bn).

'Almost all' of the Russian advances in Ukraine 'remain stalled', US defence official says

Russian forces moving on Kyiv have not appreciably progressed over the weekend, a senior US defence official said during a background briefing with reporters, CNN reports.

The official noted that the US believed Russia was trying to “flow in forces behind the advance elements” moving to the north of the Ukrainian capital.

The assaults on the cities of Chernihiv and Kharkiv also remain stalled, the official said, but Russia has split off a force of 50 to 60 vehicles to move towards the town of Izium.

Ukraine continues to defend Mariupol, though the city remains isolated, they said. Russian forces have also not moved closer to the town of Mykolaiv.

An official told reporters:

We still maintain the airspace is contested, that the Russians have not achieved air superiority over all of Ukraine.

Vladimir Putin has “100% of his assembled forces inside Ukraine”, the official said.

Ukrainian authorities have denied accusations by the Russians after a Ukrainian missile allegedly exploded in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk killing 20 civilians, Lorenzo Tondo reports.

On Monday, Russian defence ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said that ‘’a Soviet-made Tochka-U missile hit the central part of the eastern city of Donetsk’’ after it was intercepted by the pro-Russian rebels’ forces.

According to Russian-backed separatists, cited by Russia’s TASS news agency, fragments of the missile landed in the city centre, killing 20 people. Another 28 civilians, including children, were seriously wounded by the missile, Konashenkov added, describing the attack as a “war crime”.

“People were waiting in line near an ATM and were standing at a bus stop,” local separatist leader Denis Pushilin told the Rossiya 24 network. “There are children among the dead,”

However, Ukrainian military spokesman Leonid Matyukhin denied the accusations, saying that the missile, that carried shrapnel warhead, was in fact a Russian rocket.

“It is unmistakably a Russian rocket or another munition, there’s not even any point talking about it,” Matyukhin told the press.

The new scheme would allow more people to come, he said, and would benefit Ukrainians with no families ties with the UK. Ukrainians with close relatives in the country can use the existing visa system.

Ukraine’s prime minister Denys Shmyhal has urged the Council of Europe to expel Russia from its ranks in what would be a historic first at the human-rights body, Jennifer Rankin reports.

Addressing parliamentarians from across Europe via video link at an emergency meeting of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, Shmyhal said:

The right to life is one of the key fundamental rights and today at the centre of Europe this right is being violated every minute and every second.

Ukraine demanded Russia to be ousted from the Council of Europe, he said, because they could not stay “in this single European family where human life is the highest value”.

Russia announced on Friday it would leave the Council of Europe, shortly before it was stripped of its voting rights. But no country has ever been expelled from the human rights body, founded in the ashes of world war two in 1949.

The Ukrainian prime minister criticised the Council of Europe for reinstating Russia’s voting rights in 2019, after relations were restored [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/17/council-of-europe-votes-to-maintain-russia-membership-crimea] in a decision that attempted to draw a line under the seizure of Crimea in 2014. The decision to bring Russia back “showed a poor understanding by the world of the real threat that Putin’s regime is”, he said, adding that Europe had chosen “the road of pacifying the aggressor rather than defending the values of democracy, the rule of law, of human rights”.

After the annexation of Crimea, many governments baulked at expelling Russia completely because they did not wish to deny Russians the protection of the European Court of Human Rights.

Ukraine could also lose a legal avenue to pursue Russia, but Shmyhal said the Kremlin could not hide from the consequences of its actions: “We all know that punishment for genocide and terrorism cannot be avoided.”

He repeated Ukraine’s pleas for a no-fly zone, that Nato countries have so far refused, in a speech that recounted the appalling toll of the war on Ukrainian civilians. Almost 90 children had been killed, he said, and thousands of people were without food, water and heat; hundreds of schools and hospitals had been destroyed and nuclear power plants were “on the brink of disaster”.

Citizens in Crimea were being forcibly conscripted into the army of the “enemy state”, he said, adding one anecdote without additional details:

A Russian military pilot is dropping bombs on his own mother in Poltava region. It’s hard to believe that, but even such crazy things become normal life for the aggressors.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenkskiy had been due to address the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe earlier on Monday but pulled out due to “urgent unforeseen circumstances” and asked the prime minister to take his place.

The Council of Europe is due to take a decision on Russia’s future in the organisation on Tuesday.

EU agrees to freeze Roman Abramovich's assets – diplomatic sources

The EU is to sanction Roman Abramovich and other oligarchs in its latest round of punishment of Russian billionaires who have been seen as supporting Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, AFP cites three diplomatic sources as saying.

Abramovich and the others are being added to a list of individuals whose assets in the EU - including superyachts and mansions - can be seized and entry into the bloc refused, the diplomats said.

According to one source, the stated reason for sanctioning Abramovich was because he “is a Russian oligarch who has long and close ties to Vladimir Putin,” to whom he has “privileged access”.

Sanctions will be effective only after publication on the EU’s official journal, which usually happens within hours or the day following formal approval.

Rafal Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw, said that 300,000 people had arrived in the capital and pledged to continue to support refugees. But, he said on Twitter: “Our city remains the main destination for Ukrainian refugees. [The] situation is getting more and more difficult every day.”

More than 2.8 million people have fled Ukraine[https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine] since 24 February, when the Russian invasion began. According to UN Human Rights Council data, more than half have travelled to Poland.

Refugees arriving to the Polish capital[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/over-1-million-people-have-fled-ukraine-for-poland-since-invasion-says-border-guard] are mainly being accommodated in private residences, as well as two large sports arenas. Signs are now being posted in central train stations in Warsaw to direct people to other parts of Poland where there is more space to accommodate and provide for them. “Big cities in Poland are already overcrowded,” says one sign, “don’t be afraid to go to smaller towns: they are peaceful, have food, infrastructure and are well adapted.”

“I have this feeling that Warsaw is full and I hear it from many people. The reception points in Warsaw are also overcrowded,” said Marianna Ossolinska, a coordinator at the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia, which is working with refugees in Poland. Ossolinska is managing their hostel, which offers 70 beds and has been full since shortly after it opened on 2 March.

“Many refugees try to come to Warsaw, probably because they believe it will be easier to find transport to western Europe[https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news] from a capital city, or to find a job or make connections,” she said.

Convoy of cars 'leaves' encircled Ukrainian city of Mariupol - Reuters

A convoy of more than 160 cars departed from Mariupol on Monday, local officials said, in what appeared to be the first successful attempt to arrange a “humanitarian corridor” to evacuate civilians from the encircled Ukrainian city.

Civilians have been trapped in the Black Sea port city for more than two weeks and are running out of supplies after being surrounded by Russian forces, the Ukrainian authorities say.

After several days of failed attempts to deliver supplies to Mariupol and provide safe passage out for trapped civilians, the city council said a local ceasefire was holding and the convoy had left for the city of Zaporizhzhia.

“It is known that as of 1pm (11am GMT) more than 160 private cars managed to leave,” it said in an online post. It said the convoy had reached the nearby city of Berdyansk and was heading on towards Zaporizhzhia.

“There is also confirmation that a ceasefire is currently holding along the humanitarian corridor that has been established,” it said. Reuters was unable immediately to verify the convoy’s progress.

Germany has said an immediate boycott of Russian gas and oil supplies could hurt its own population more than Vladimir Putin, bringing mass unemployment and poverty.

“If we flip a switch immediately, there will be supply shortages, even supply stops in Germany,” the economic and energy minister Robert Habeck told public broadcaster ARD on Sunday, as Europe’s largest economy intensely searches to diversify its energy supplies in the medium term.

The Green party politician predicted “mass unemployment, poverty, people who can’t heat their homes, people who run out of petrol” if his country stopped using Russian oil and gas.

Few other western economies are as dependent on Russian energy as Germany: 55% of the natural gas, 52% of the coal and 34% of mineral oil used in the country comes from Russia, for which it pays hundreds of thousands of euros daily, financially supporting the war machine devastating Ukraine.

Habeck said his government was working hard to ensure Germany would be in a position to give up Russian coal by the summer, and to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year, but that a short-term ban on Russian gas could leave his country exposed.

Squatters have occupied a mansion belonging to the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska in central London, Diane Taylor reports.

The five squatters in the building in Belgrave Square – two from eastern Europe, though not from Ukraine – say they feel their countries are also under threat from Vladimir Putin. Their plan is to open up the mansion, which they say “has too many rooms to count” including a cinema and a wine cellar, to Ukrainians fleeing the war, along with other refugees needing shelter.

In a message to Russian oligarchs, the squatters said: “You occupy Ukraine, we occupy you.”

A significant police presence barred entry to the cream-coloured stone building with a black front door and pillars at the entrance. Officers were later seen using a drill to break through the front door and entering the building. The squatters shouted: “Criminal damage” from the balcony above.

This part of London has been nicknamed “oligarchs’ quarter” because so many wealthy Russians have bought properties here, a stone’s throw from Buckingham Palace.

The line that supplies the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the town of Slavutych was damaged by the occupying forces.

Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University, said he believed the chance that China would supply weapons to Russia was “small”, Helen Davidson reports.

“Doing it would be both too late to help the distant war in Ukraine, and would look very bad for Beijing. It’s not worth it,” he said.

However Sung said the US’s public airing of Russia’s requests - which were still of real concern - also allowed it to pressure Beijing on its civilian trade with Russia, which could include non-military parts and components which could be used in weapons production.

By flagging the possibility of the Chinese providing military aid, Washington actually is laying down talking points to nudge China into limiting ‘civilian trading relationship’ with Russia and semi-joining (however partially) the international economic sanctions against Russia.

If it works, it will reduce China-Russia trade and further weaken Russia; if it doesn’t, it will help shore up the ‘China is Russia’s enabler’ image, and claim moral high ground for the US vis-a-vis China.

Professor Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute, said Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, would not want to put China’s economy at risk during a year when his top priority is securing a third term.

China under Xi will give whatever support it can to help Putin but it will not allow itself to suffer from secondary sanctions as it does so, despite the [agreement] of ‘rock solid’ support and a friendship ‘without limits.

A former Russian foreign minister has joined a call for all sides in the Ukrainian war to return to diplomacy and reduce “the dramatically elevated risk” of a catastrophic nuclear war, Patrick Wintour reports.

The appeal co-authored by Professor Igor Ivanov, the president of the Russian International Affairs Council, may be a sign that some in the Russian foreign policy establishment believe the risks of Russia pursuing a purely military solution to its grievances in Ukraine is a strategic mistake.

Ivanov was the Russian foreign minister under Boris Yeltsin from 1998 to 2004 and resigned following Vladimir Putin’s appointment as President. Ivanov was succeeded by Sergei Lavrov, but has retained a status in Russian foreign policy circles.

The statement urging all sides to back a ceasefire, and end the unjustifiable loss of civilian lives, is signed by Ivanov and a group of foreign policy heavyweights such as Wolfgang Ischinger, the former chair of the Munich Security Conference, Sam Nunn, the co-chair, Nuclear Threat Initiative, and former US Senator, and Lord Browne, the former UK defence secretary.

Ivanov as a former Yeltsin era minister is hardly part of Putin’s inner circle, but he may reflect unease in the marginalised Russian ministry of foreign affairs.

The statement comes as negotiators from Russia and Ukraine met for a third round of bilateral talks. Both sides ahead of the talks sounded more optimistic than before, but the cause for their optimism was unclear.

The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy is pressing for a direct meeting with the Russian president Vladimir Putin. France, the UK and the US remain sceptical that Russia is yet willing to negotiate a settlement that the Ukrainian leadership would find acceptable.

The German chancellor Olaf Scholz flew to Turkey for talks with the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkey has been offering to act as a mediator and hosted talks between Lavrov and the Ukrainian foreign minister Dmitry Kulaba.

The joint statement avoids attributing responsibility for the war but instead focuses on the responsibility of nuclear weapon states to eliminate nuclear risks, adding the ongoing conflict in Ukraine elevates such risks dramatically.

They warn:

The firefight at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine was the latest reminder of how nuclear catastrophe can quickly rise to the surface in the ‘fog of war.’ The leaders of China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States together affirmed in January that ‘a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.’

The first and most essential step toward reducing the risks of a consequential accident, mistake, or miscalculation is a ceasefire to end the unacceptable and unjustifiable loss of human lives, including innocent civilians.

Dialogue, diplomacy and negotiations are the only acceptable route to resolving the conflict in a way that can stand the test of time. We must return to diplomacy and dialogue to ensure current disputes on core issues are negotiated and not fought. We welcome the first attempts of Russia and Ukraine to start such negotiations. We also welcome the efforts of world leaders aimed at finding a political settlement.

In telephone talks, Mitsotakis expressed Greece’s “undivided support” for Kyiv, emphasising that despite Russian fury Athens was committed to sending further assistance to Ukraine as well as taking in refugees from the war-torn state.

Mitsotakis’ office said in a statement:

The dramatic situation in areas where the Greek diaspora live and the need for the opening of humanitarian corridors for the safe exodus [of people] and access of humanitarian aid was also discussed.

The plight of the Greek general consul - the last remaining EU diplomat in the besieged southern city of Mariuopol - was also raised, it said.

The envoy has been holed up with local staff in the Mariupol offices of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) after the rest of the diplomatic mission fled earlier this month. The strategic port city is home to some 120,000 expatriate Greeks, a community with roots in the region for more than 2,000 years.

The Greek leader told Zelenskiy that the “wholehearted implementation of sanctions by partners and allies” would play a vital role in pressuring Moscow to stop the attacks.

Greece, which traditionally has enjoyed strong relations with fellow Orthodox Russia, has spectacularly fallen out with Moscow over Ukraine with the centre-right government going so far as to include weapons among the assistance it has sent to Ukraine in the 19 days since the invasion began.

Russia denies asking China for military help in Ukraine

Russia could take full control of major Ukrainian cities and has sufficient military clout to fulfil all of its aims in Ukraine without any need for help from China, the Kremlin said.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russian troops could take “major population centres under full control” in Ukraine.

When asked by Reuters about remarks by US officials who had said Russia had asked China for military equipment, Peskov denied the claims.

He replied:

Russia possesses its own independent potential to continue the operation. As we said, it is going according to plan and will be completed on time and in full.

Russian airstrike hits residential building in Kyiv

A Russian airstrike has hit a residential building in Kyiv as Moscow’s forces stepped up their brutal campaign to capture Ukraine’s capital and other major cities, even as a fourth round of peace talks between the two sides got under way, Jon Henley reports.

A day after Russia attacked a military base near the Polish border[https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2022/mar/13/russia-sends-message-with-yavoriv-strike-but-attack-on-poland-unlikely], an airstrike in Kyiv’s Obolon district killed one person and wounded several others, emergency services said on Monday, revising an earlier death toll down by one.

One person was found dead in the nine-storey apartment building, officials said, with three more people hospitalised as air raid sirens sounded in the capital and other cities hours before Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were set to resume talks.

Kyiv city authorities also said on Monday that the Antonov aircraft plant, also known as Hostomel, about 11km north-west of the centre, had been shelled. The site is the country’s most important international cargo airport, as well as a key military airbase. They said the city was stockpiling two weeks’ worth of food for the 2 million people who have not yet fled.

The fourth round of formal talks – held via videoconference – would focus on achieving a ceasefire, securing Russian troop withdrawals and establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, a Ukrainian negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Monday, after both sides gave positive assessments for progress.

“The parties actively express their specified positions,” Podolyak tweeted.

Communication is being held yet it’s hard. The reason for the discord is two different political systems.

Podolyak had said earlier that Russia was “beginning to talk constructively” and he thought “we will achieve some results literally in a matter of days”. A Russian delegate, Leonid Slutsky, also said daily contact between the two teams had allowed significant progress and draft agreements could be possible soon.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said one aim of the “difficult negotiating work” was to set up a meeting between himself and Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, with the ultimate goal of “Ukraine getting the necessary result for peace and for security”.

The country’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called on the west on Monday to supply Ukraine with weapons and apply further sanctions on Russia to help prevent other countries being dragged into a wider conflict.

Kuleba tweeted:

To those abroad scared of being dragged into WWIII: Ukraine fights back successfully. We need you to help us fight. Provide us with all necessary weapons.

Apply more sanctions on Russia and isolate it fully. Help Ukraine force Putin into failure and you will avert a larger war.

A close ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin has admitted Russia’s military operation in Ukraine has not gone as quickly as the Kremlin had wanted, Reuters reports.

National Guard chief Viktor Zolotov blamed the slower than expected progress on what he said were far-right Ukrainian forces hiding behind civilians, an accusation repeatedly made by Russian officials.

Speaking at a church service led by Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on Sunday, Zolotov said:

I would like to say that yes, not everything is going as fast as we would like.

But we are going towards our goal step by step and victory will be for us, and this icon will protect the Russian army and accelerate our victory.

Zolotov is a powerful security official who was once in charge of Putin’s personal security and who now heads the National Guard.

His comments signalled the strongest public acknowledgement from Moscow that Russia’s advances have not gone to plan. They also appeared to be at odds with an assessment on Friday, by Russia’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu, who told Putin that “everything is going according to plan”.

China’s foreign ministry has reacted angrily to reports of US government claims that Russia had asked China’s government for military equipment, Helen Davidson writes.

The reports in multiple US outlets cited US officials saying Moscow had been seeking weapons from Beijing[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/us-will-try-to-convince-china-not-to-supply-arms-to-russia-at-key-rome-meeting] for some time.

At the regular press briefing in Beijing on Monday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said the US was spreading “malicious disinformation”, with “sinister intentions”, according to translations by journalists in the room.

Zhao said:

China’s position on the Ukraine issue is consistent and clear, and China has been playing a constructive role in promoting peace talks.

It is imperative that all parties exercise restraint and cool down tensions, not add fuel to the fire.

The comments came just hours before a meeting in Rome began between US national security advisor Jake Sullivan and China’s most senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, where Sullivan was expected to urge Yang not to supply arms to Moscow.

Zhao earlier said the meeting was to “implement the important consensus reached in the video meeting between the heads of state of China and the United States in November last year”.

Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday the full implementation of sanctions by European Union countries would help put pressure on Russia to stop attacks.

The two leaders discussed the impact of Russia’s invasion by phone, the Greek premier’s office said.

“The [Greek] prime minister stressed... that the full implementation of sanctions by all member states and allies will help increase pressure on Russia to stop the attacks,” Mitsotakis’ office said.

Mitsotakis assured Zelenskiy the Greek government fully supports Ukraine, Reuters reported. Greece was sending aid and was ready to host refugees.

The two leaders also agreed on the need for a humanitarian corridor in stricken regions such as Mariupol, where hundreds of ethnic Greeks live. Athens is also making efforts to evacuate its consul general and other people from Mariupol.

Mitsotakis discussed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday.

Allies of the Ukrainian president Voldymyr Zelenskiy say Vladimir Putin will only accept a compromise on Ukraine’s future neutrality if he is facing a credible threat to his economic power base by a rapid and permanent exclusion of Russia’s oil and gas exports [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/russia-threatens-europes-gas-supplies-as-west-mulls-oil-import-ban-over-ukraine-invasion] from its lucrative European markets.

The Russian government receives 40% of its budget revenues from energy exports.

But Ukraine is meeting stubborn resistance from Germany[https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany], which insists its economy would be plunged into recession if it suddenly lost access to Russian gas and oil.

In an interview reflecting the moral pressure Germany is under to do more, Germany’s Green economics minister, Robert Habeck, admitted Europe in the past had fed Ukraine[https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine] false promises, but said Germany could not afford “the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs” that a full energy embargo would require. He said Germany at best could be freed of Russian coal by the autumn, of its oil by the end of the year, but could set no date for ending German reliance on gas.

The impasse is leaving senior allies of Zelenskiy feeling frustrated, and appealing to the UK and the US to use the G7 to try to persuade the Germany chancellor Olaf Scholz to sign up to a western timetable to end dependence on Russian energy.

A pregnant woman and her baby have died after Russia bombed the maternity hospital where she was meant to give birth, the Associated Press has learned.

Images[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/ukraine-mariupol-civilians-russia-war] of the woman being rushed to an ambulance on a stretcher had circled the world, epitomising the horror of the attack.

In video and photos after the bombing of the hospital in Mariupol last Wednesday, the woman was seen stroking her bloodied lower abdomen as rescuers rushed her through the rubble.

The woman was taken to another hospital, closer to the frontline, where doctors laboured to keep her alive. Realising she was losing her baby, medics said, she cried out to them: “Kill me now.”

Timur Marin, a surgeon, said he found the woman’s pelvis crushed and hip detached. Medics delivered the baby via caesarean section but it showed no signs of life, Marin said. Then they focused on the mother.

“More than 30 minutes of resuscitation of the mother didn’t produce results,” Marin said. “Both died.”

Vladimir Putin will be “held responsible” for war crimes in Ukraine at the international criminal court in The Hague, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, has pledged, saying the UK would help gather the necessary evidence.

The justice secretary, Dominic Raab, was travelling to The Hague on Monday to help make sure that “when that prosecution comes, the court will have what it needs”, Javid told BBC One’s Breakfast programme.

Javid was asked for his response to the news that a pregnant woman shown in a much-used photograph being stretchered out of a bombed maternity hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol had reportedly since died[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/14/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-talks-resume-blockade-black-sea-coast-zelenskiy-putin-live?page=with:block-622edc218f08527b3685632d#block-622edc218f08527b3685632d], as had her baby.

“It fills me with rage to see something like that. These are appalling atrocities committed on innocent civilians in Ukraine[https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine] by the Russians,” Javid said, saying the World Health Organization had documented 31 attacks so far on health facilities.

“These are war crimes and Putin will be held responsible,” he added. Asked how, Javid said: “He will be ultimately held responsible for sure by the international court. Today, the justice secretary, my colleague, is going to The Hague and he’ll be meeting there with the chief prosecutor and others, offering UK support to gather evidence.”

The German multinational pharmaceutical company Bayer has suspended advertising and investments in Russia, it announced today.

In a statement, the Bayer group said:

As a response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Bayer stopped all spending in Russia and Belarus that is not related to supplying essential products in health and agriculture. This includes:

Suspending all advertising and other promotional activities.

Halting capital investment projects indefinitely.

Not pursuing any new business opportunities.

We have also heard voices calling for a complete stop of delivery of all our products to Russia and Belarus. We understand these concerns as the war raises moral and ethical issues for every company.

Our position is that this senseless war has already taken many lives. As a Life Science company, we have an ethical obligation – in every country we operate in. Withholding essential health and agriculture products from the civilian populations – like cancer or cardiovascular treatments, health products for pregnant women and children as well as seeds to grow food – would only multiply the war’s ongoing toll on human life.

The Tate has severed relations with Viktor Vekselberg and Petr Aven after the Russian billionaires were sanctioned[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-oligarchs-business-figures-west-sanction-lists-us-eu-uk-ukraine] by the US and EU after the invasion of Ukraine.

Vekselberg, the founder of a Russian energy conglomerate and an associate of Vladimir Putin, was an honorary member of the prestigious Tate Foundation[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/01/tate-faces-call-to-cut-ties-with-russian-oligarch-viktor-vekselberg-and-vladimir-putin-associate], a fundraising charity for acquisitions, exhibitions, education and capital projects.

“Mr Vekselberg donated to Tate seven years ago and no longer holds his honorary membership title,” the London gallery group said. Vekselberg has already been the target of US sanctions imposed in 2018.

On Friday, he was again among a list of Russian billionaires facing US sanctions, with the government saying he has “maintained close ties” with Putin. His jet and yacht have been identified as “blocked property”.

As well as the Tate, he has donated in the US to the Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall – prior to sanctions being imposed.

Vekselberg’s fortune is estimated to be as much as $9.3bn (£6.9bn), which he began amassing after Russia’s oil and aluminium industries were privatised.

Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoganwill discuss the war in Ukraine with German chancellor Olaf Scholz at talks in Ankara on Monday, his office said.

It comes as both countries press on with efforts to secure a ceasefire 19 days into Russia’s invasion, Reuters reported.

Nato member Turkey shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has good ties with both. It has said the invasion is unacceptable and voiced support for Ukraine, but has also opposed sanctions on Moscow, while offering to mediate.

Ukraine said on Sunday it was working with Turkey and Israel as mediators to set a place and framework for talks with Russia, after Turkey hosted the foreign ministers of the warring nations for the first high-level talks last week.

Monday’s visit will mark Scholz’s first trip to Turkey since taking office in December 2021 and comes amid efforts by Germany to engage with Russian president Vladimir Putin to end Moscow’s invasion. Germany and France have taken leading roles within the European Union to end the war.

“Aside from bilateral ties, an exchange of views is expected to be held on other regional and international issues, primarily Ukraine and Turkey-EU relations,” the Turkish presidency said.

Turkey says it can facilitate peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, but says that a ceasefire and humanitarian corridors are needed first.

The British health secretary Sajid Javid said the Ukraine family scheme for refugees was “being made easier and more straightforward” from Tuesday.

He told Times Radio the latest information from Saturday revealed “just over 3,000” visas had been granted through the programme.

But he said:

As well as that particular scheme, the extended family scheme being made easier and more straightforward by our online-only process from tomorrow, there’s the new homes for Ukrainian families scheme, which will also go live later this week.

Javid said there would be a basic level of security checks in both schemes, and he added:

I think that is right because you want to get the right balance between sort of speed and the people that we’re trying to help are in a desperate situation, and you want to bring that help as quickly as possible, but also do some basic checks and I think what we have done here is the right balance.

The health secretary said those offering a place for refugees to stay would be subject to Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks.

Australia and the Netherlands have launched legal proceedings against Russia through the International Civil Aviation Organization for the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.

The legal action could compel Russia to take part in stalled negotiations with the two countries, and could also result in it being penalised by the United Nations-linked organisation that is responsible for the administration of international aviation law.

Australia and the Netherlands have been seeking compensation and an apology from the Russian federation for the MH17 disaster, in which 298 people, including 38 Australians, died when it was shot down over Ukraine in 2014.

Ria van der Steen, who lost her father and stepmother in the MH17 crash, is preparing to give testimony in court in the trial of four men charged with murder over the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.

However, Russia, which has denied involvement despite the findings of an international investigation, unilaterally withdrew from negotiations with the two countries in October 2020.

Germany will reportedly purchase up to 35 F-35 fighter jets, a government source said on Monday, after sources told Reuters earlier that the government in Berlin had decided in principle to buy the US fighter jets.

Desperately needed medical gear and equipment, including trauma kits, is reaching Ukraine to prop up a healthcare system grappling with a shortage of supplies amid Russia’s invasion, the World Health Organization has said.

Supply chains have been severely disrupted, with many distributors knocked out, some stockpiles out of reach because of military operations, supplies of medicine running low, as hospitals struggle to care for the sick and wounded, it said.

“The current estimated number of people impacted in Ukraine is 18 million, of which 6.7 million are internally displaced,” the agency said in a statement[https://www.euro.who.int/en/media-centre/sections/press-releases/2022/who-is-working-day-and-night-to-keep-medical-supply-chains-open-and-preserve-ukraines-health-system]. “Nearly 3 million people have fled the country.”

WHO was working with partners to alleviate shortages of critical equipment and medication such as oxygen and insulin, surgical supplies, anaesthetics, and transfusion kits, it added.

Items being shipped included oxygen generators, electrical generators, defibrillators, monitors, anaesthesia drugs, rehydration salts, gauze and bandages.

WHO said supplies were being distributed in coordination with Ukraine’s health ministry, backed by a support hub in neighbouring Poland.

The coming days and weeks will see a constant flow of medical supplies, as part of an effort to ensure people’s access to essential drugs and medical care.”

Pregnant woman seen in images fleeing Ukrainian hospital bombing has died with her baby: reports

A pregnant woman seen in widely circulated images after Russian bombing of Ukrainian hospital has died with her baby, the Associated Press is reporting.

The woman was escaping the bombing of the maternity hospital where she was meant to give birth in the besieged city of Mariupol.

Images of the woman being rushed to an ambulance on a stretcher had circled the world as rescuers rushed her through the rubble.

The woman was rushed to another hospital where doctors laboured to keep her alive. Medics delivered the baby via cesarean section, but it showed “no signs of life”, surgeon Timur Marin said.

“More than 30 minutes of resuscitation of the mother didn’t produce results,” Marin said on Saturday. “Both died.”

In the chaos after Wednesday’s airstrike, medics did not have time to get the woman’s name before her husband and father came to take away her body, AP reports.

Leader of Russia’s Chechnya region claims to be outside Kyiv

Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Russia’s Chechnya region, is reportedly in Ukraine alongside Russian forces, according to footage shared by Chechen television channels and posted to Kadyrov’s Telegram account.

Kadyrov posted a video on Telegram of himself on Monday in military uniform studying plans around a table with soldiers in a room.

In a message[https://t.me/RKadyrov_95/1448], he said that the video had been taken at Hostomel, an airfield near Kyiv, Agence France-Presse reports.

“ The other day we were about 20km from you Kyiv Nazis and now we are even closer,” Kadyrov reportedly wrote as he called on Ukrainian forces to surrender “or you will be finished”.

“We will show you that Russian practice teaches warfare better than foreign theory and the recommendations of military advisers,” he added.

The Chechen television channel Grozny also posted a video on its Telegram channel earlier on Sunday that showed Kadyrov in a darkened room discussing with Chechen troops a military operation they said took place 7km (4.3 miles) from the Ukrainian capital.

The videos could not be independently verified.

Kadyrov and his forces have been accused by international NGOs of serious human rights violations in the tightly controlled Caucasus republic. He is a former rebel turned Kremlin ally who has previously described himself as Putin’s “foot soldier” with a paramilitary force at his command.

Russia’s coal and fertiliser tycoon Andrei Melnichenko has urged for a ceasefire in Ukraine, calling the war a tragedy that must be stopped and describing a looming global food crisis amid rising fertilizer prices.

“The events in Ukraine are truly tragic. We urgently need peace,” Melnichenko, 50, who is Russian but was born in Belarus and has a Ukrainian mother, told Reuters in a statement emailed by his spokesman on Monday.

“As a Russian by nationality, a Belarusian by birth, and a Ukrainian by blood, I feel great pain and disbelief witnessing brotherly peoples fighting and dying.”

5.21am GMT

We have seen how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine - coming after the Covid supply disruptions - has sent food prices soaring to record highs, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation.

The supply gap from the war could push global food and feed prices as much as 22% above their already elevated prices, the FAO said late last week.

Wheat prices have led the rises, not least because Ukraine itself accounts for about one-eighth of global trade in the commodity, or about 25 million tonnes in a normal year. Russia exports too, are likely to face more sanctions.

The more immediate risk - which is not as priced into commodity markets - is in the spring crops that are not yet planted in Ukraine, namely corn and sunflowers, according to Stefan Vogel, head of the Australian unit of RaboResearch.

The European Union, for instance, sources 40-60% of its feed grain for animals from Ukraine. The US would be a potential supplier but the EU restricts genetically modified crops, making Brazil the only major alternative source, Vogel said.

Global #foodprices[https://twitter.com/hashtag/foodprices?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] rise to record high in February, led by vegetable oils & dairy products.

The @FAO[https://twitter.com/FAO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] Food Price Index averaged 140.7 points in Feb, up 3.9% from Jan, & 3.1 points higher than in Feb 2011.

— FAO Newsroom (@FAOnews) March 4, 2022[https://twitter.com/FAOnews/status/1499793252056195074?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]

Brazil’s grain crops were poor last year, so there is an expectation that supplies won’t be as low.

“Brazil needs to be exceptionally good - and it doesn’t look like it for now, but we’re in early stages - to really bring price pressure on the corn market,” Vogel said.

While richer nations can shuffle supplies and substitute crops, poorer ones don’t have that luxury.

Assuming the disruptions are prolonged, the global number of undernourished people could increase by 8 to 13 million people in 2022/23, with the most pronounced increases taking place in Asia-Pacific, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, and the Near East and North Africa”, the FAO said.

Vogel expects the impact on food prices prices to be sustained, particularly because energy prices are likely to stay high, pushing up the cost of inputs including fertilisers.

“I think the grain market has to work through this [shock] not only in the next two months, but probably the next two years,” he said.

Belarusian armed forces are pushing asylum seekers from the Middle East who became trapped in the country after they were promised passage to the EU to cross the border into war-torn Ukraine[https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine], according to the testimony of people in Belarusian camps.

Dozens of asylum seekers stuck for months in a makeshift dormitory in Bruzgi, a village in Belarus[https://www.theguardian.com/world/belarus] less than a mile from the Polish border, were ordered by a group of Belarusian soldiers on 5 March to leave the building at gunpoint and given two options: crossing the border into Poland, where guards have beaten them back, or entering Ukraine, one of them said.

“A group of seven border guard officers that we had never seen before entered the building,” said a man who arrived in Belarus last autumn, and whose name and nationality cannot be disclosed for security reasons.

“They wore military clothes and, for the first time, they entered the camp holding weapons, beating us and telling us that we had two choices – either crossing into Poland[https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland] or going to Ukraine.”

US to convince China not to supply arms to Russia

The Guardian’s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, talks through the state of play between the US, China and Russia.

The United States will try to persuade China not to supply arms to Russia at a high-level meeting in Rome which the White House sees as critically important not just for the war in Ukraine[https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine] but also for the future of the global balance of power.

Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, will meet his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, in the Italian capital amid reports that Russia[https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia] has asked China for weapons to bolster its faltering invasion of Ukraine.

Sullivan will point out that the US briefed Beijing on Vladimir Putin’s intentions months ahead of the invasion, but that the Chinese leadership ignored those warnings, mistakenly believing that Putin was bluffing to gain leverage, according to sources familiar with plans for the Rome meeting. Sullivan will also argue that if China[https://www.theguardian.com/world/china] supplies weapons to Moscow it will be a further, historic mistake, and a turning point in global politics.

The White House is anxious to prevent the Ukraine war further cementing a division of the world into two opposing blocs. In an interview with CNN[https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/13/politics/jake-sullivan-meeting-chinese-counterpart-ukraine/index.html], Sullivan said:

We also are watching closely to see the extent to which China actually does provide any form of support – material support or economic support – to Russia.

It is a concern of ours. And we have communicated to Beijing that we will not stand by and allow any country to compensate Russia for its losses from the economic sanctions.”

Sullivan said the US had made clear to Beijing that there would “absolutely be consequences” for “large-scale” efforts to help Russia sidestep sanctions.

Russia has also asked China for economic help as it faces severe western sanctions, but Sullivan told CNN the US was “communicating directly, privately to Beijing that there will absolutely be consequences” if China helps Russia evade sanctions.

The Financial Times[https://www.ft.com/content/30850470-8c8c-4b53-aa39-01497064a7b7?desktop=true&segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content], New York Times [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/13/us/politics/russia-china-ukraine.html] and Washington Post[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/13/russia-ukraine-war-news-live-updates/] reported on Sunday about the Russian request for weapons, amid claims from US officials that the Russian military was running short on certain kinds of armaments.

The spokesperson for the US embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, told CNN he had “never heard” of the Russian arms requests.

“The current situation in Ukraine is indeed disconcerting,” he said in a statement. “The high priority now is to prevent the tense situation from escalating or even getting out of control.”

Talks are set to continue between Ukraine[https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine] and Russiatoday with officials on both sides offering cautious optimism despite little evidence that Russian president Vladimir Putin’s position has changed.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podoliak confirmed talks will take place with Russia[https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia] on Monday via video link.

“Again. Negotiations go non-stop in the format of video conferences. Working groups are constantly functioning. A large number of issues require constant attention. On Monday, March 14, a negotiating session will be held to sum up the preliminary results…” Podoliak said in a Twitter post on Sunday.

“Russia is starting to talk constructively,” Podolyak later added over Telegram[https://t.me/nexta_live/21529], noting that Russia “is much more sensitive to Ukraine’s position”.

In a video message, the senior advisor said Ukraine’s proposals are “very tough” and concern “above all the withdrawal of troops, the cessation of hostilities”.

“I think we will reach some concrete results, literally, in a few days,” he added.

In the face of increasingly bloody attacks on Ukrainian cities, and as civilians continue to die there, [Foreign Minister] Luigi Di Maio said: "A humanitarian truce is needed right away, under the aegis of the UN , to save as many people as possible. Not just a ten-hour break, not one lasting just an office hours shift: a number of days are needed." The Foreign Minister spoke with us in video conference from the Farnesina [Foreign Ministry] upon his return from Turkey and immediately before leaving for Congo together with ENI CEO Claudio Descalzi . The two will also travel to Angola on the following day. These trips aim to secure additional energy supply sources besides those that Italy has from Qatar, Algeria, Libya.

[Cuzzocrea] The energy issue was at the heart of the Versailles summit. What was decided?

[Di Maio] The plan that Prime Minister Mario Draghi has submitted to the EU Commission calls for establishing a ceiling on the price of gas, which will no longer have to be affected by the cost of energy produced from renewable sources. This will also have the effect of a sanction against Russia: the revenues to finance this war will be lower and lower.

[Cuzzocrea] Do you rule out the possibility of banning Russian gas?

[Di Maio] There were no vetoes on our part. [EU Commission] President [Ursula] von der Leyen spoke of a fourth package of sanctions and we do not rule anything out. In the meantime, we are working on energy diversification, which will allow us to lower prices. In a short time, we will be able, with due prudence, to overcome the problems holding back re-gasification plants in Italy.

[Cuzzocrea] Is this backtracking on the path of energy transition?

[Di Maio] We are trying to unlock more renewable energy sources by granting wind permits. In the meantime, we must make the most of domestic gas production and we have had to restart some coal-fired power plants, but just for as long as the emergency lasts. We need to compensate for the 29 billion cubic metres [of gas] that come from Russia. In two months, we will be able to cover for half of it. I am optimistic about the possibility of going even further.

[Cuzzocrea] Will it be necessary to force the EU 's hand to let Ukraine become an EU member?

[Di Maio] I would avoid the word forcing. There are countries that have been waiting for their EU membership for 10 years, as those in the Western Balkans have. However, the issue of Ukraine must be tackled, in compliance with the Treaties, with the utmost speed. Italy is ready to lend its strong support. I am just back from Turkey, where two important pieces of news arrived as we sat at the mediation table: the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers are willing to meet again and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is willing to meet [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy. The meeting must be prepared, but for the first time there is a glimmer of hope that a compromise might be reached. Ukraine's EU membership should not be part of the negotiation since it is a divisive issue. However, it must be clear that the EU is ready to welcome Ukraine and that the ambitions of its president and its people are more than legitimate.

[Cuzzocrea] Russia continues to demand the country's "neutrality" as its first condition.

[Di Maio] Should neutrality turn out to be essential in order to reach a compromise, one will need an international agreement with guarantors. Instead, the issue concerning the territories of Donbas and Crimea must be addressed through different mechanisms.

[Cuzzocrea] Do you not think that the message that came out of the Versailles summit was weak?

[Di Maio] When you initiate an in-depth analysis of common defence and common indebtedness to finance it, you are giving the EU Commission a mandate to address the gas issue in the short and medium term, including deciding to finance new investments setting aside the Stability Pact. Thus, the foundations were laid for decisions that could come as early as the next meeting of the EU Council. It took us four months to come up with Next Generation EU. It is very different; I do not want to draw comparisons. We just have to work on speeding up things. But never before has the EU been as united as it is at this moment. The speed with which the temporary protection directive was implemented is unprecedented. This is a historical course of action, one that meets the needs of border countries.

[Cuzzocrea] Rumour has it that there will be three-way talks with [German Chancellor Olaf] Scholz, [French President Emmanuel] Macron, and Putin. Is Italy lagging behind as far as diplomatic efforts are concerned?

[Di Maio] Do not mistake assiduous and confidential work for lack of activity. Draghi is constantly hearing from all of his European counterparts and heads of state, including Zelensky. Italy is working in close coordination with NATO , the EU, and the United Nations. We were the promoters of the vote on the condemnation of Russia, which went beyond all expectations at the Glass Palace [UN headquarters]. In recent days, I have had important discussions with the Indian, Israeli, Chinese, and Turkish [foreign] ministers. We are trying to encourage initiatives like the one we saw in Antalya, but we need to immediately set up a table for the humanitarian truce involving the UN , the Red Cross, and the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees ]. These organisations are on the ground and are trying to negotiate ceasefires in individual cities with enormous difficulties. On Monday [14 March], I will be in Moldova to bring 8 million euros' worth of goods from our development cooperation program to one of the countries on the border that is experiencing difficulties because of higher refugee inflows. Then I will travel to Romania.

[Cuzzocrea] Today you met NATO Secretary General [Jen] Stoltenberg.

[Di Maio] We reiterated the impossibility of establishing a no-fly zone and supplying fighter jets to Ukraine from Poland or Slovakia. There is a risk of widening the conflict. The consequence would be a world war.

[Cuzzocrea] This is also what [US President] Joe Biden said today. Is America doing enough?

[Di Maio] Not seeing the United States active in the media does not mean that it is not active from a diplomatic point of view.

[Cuzzocrea] What about China?

[Di Maio] They do not approve of the combat; they say they are willing to facilitate a path to peace; they are calling for a ceasefire. We must not forget our differences, but all the same we must encourage China to mediate between the parties.

[Cuzzocrea] Draghi said: "Putin does not want peace."

[Di Maio] These last few hours inclined us toward pessimism. To avoid an escalation, we must heavily weaken Putin with sanctions. It is not true that they are not working. For Russia, paying only in rubles means that its default has practically already happened. Its stock market remains closed. JP Morgan has predicted a double-digit decline in Russia's GDP for 2022. The more we weaken the Russian economy, the less Putin will be able to finance this war. I do not want to appear detached from reality, from what is happening, but diplomacy is indeed the only way to prevent the conflict from spreading. It is no coincidence that there are more troops, more aircraft deployed on the borders of NATO countries. Let us practise deterrence, let us not get into the conflict, but let us do everything we can to prevent it from spreading. Now it is up to Putin to show that he wants peace.

[Cuzzocrea] Is it true that you had advised [League Secretary Matteo] Salvini against making his trip to Poland?

[Di Maio] We did not advise anyone against going to Poland. All are free to act as they like and are accountable for their own actions. I publicly thanked [Florence] Mayor [Dario] Nardella for his initiative of cities for peace. I believe that as a country right now we must continue to support the weakening of Vladimir Putin . If he carries on in this way, he condemns his people to economic death, and that people will abandon him. Diplomacy time is not war time. We must keep our people at peace. It is not true that we are at war. And precisely because we are not, we can offer protection to the Ukrainian citizens.

[Cuzzocrea] Do you believe that Russia is committing war crimes?

[Di Maio] We have submitted a procedure to the International Court in The Hague to verify whether war crimes were committed. We have to do all the work it takes to get to certify what is happening on the ground. Judging from what I gather from both open and classified sources at our disposal, the Russian Army is perpetrating brutal, inhumane attacks on defenceless civilians and this is unacceptable.

[Cuzzocrea] The Italian Parliament is planning a hearing from Ukrainian President Zelensky via video conference. Someone from your political party, the Five Star Movement [M5S], does not agree with this choice.

[Di Maio] The line that the M5S must keep in foreign policy was reiterated by [M5S President] Giuseppe Conte . As far as I am concerned, Zelensky has proven to be a world hero. He absolutely deserves to be heard, even though there is a possibility that it will ask for things that we are not willing to do, such as the no-fly zone. I support the Parliament's initiative, which will also be a way to show solidarity with all the Ukrainian people. I thank the President of the Chamber of Deputies Roberto Fico for getting the ball rolling.

[Cuzzocrea] Is there a risk of a nuclear escalation?

[Di Maio] We are working to prevent NATO from entering the conflict precisely to avoid that risk. We need the utmost caution and prudence. The attacks on nuclear power plants, however, are disturbing and are part of Putin's strategy. But these jeopardise not just Ukraine, the EU, and Belarus. The Russian people are also in danger. In the next few hours, I will hear from the director of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency ]. We need to make sure that his men might gain immediate access to the nuclear power plants, because in some cases they have stopped transmitting data.

EU at war over Russian sanctions: Germany and Italy are among nations trying to block more restrictions to protect their own economies despite pressure from Poland and Baltic states that are right on Putin's doorstep

* Germany and Italy among countries in the EU understood to be 'prioritising own economies' over sanctions

* It comes as countries on border with Ukraine and Russia, including Poland, are pushing for more restrictions

* Internal struggle is ensuing inside the EU between 'three sides' with differing viewpoints, diplomats have said

* 'Sanctionistas' and 'Contras' disagree over sanctions, with the remaining countries some stuck in middle

Germany and Italy are among nations trying to block more Russian sanctions in a bid to protect their own economies, despite pressure from Poland and the Baltic states that are right on Putin's doorstep.

The Russian President yesterday claimed Western 'attempts to have global dominance' are coming to an end as he slammed sanctions imposed because the EU 'doesn't want a strong and sovereign Russia'.

But the bloc is now beginning to split into 'three sides' as Germany - with support from Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria and Greece - is accused of 'openly putting the brakes on' sanctions amid concern about the impact on its own economy.

It comes as pro-sanction countries, led by Poland and the Baltic states, are pushing for further and stronger restrictions against Russia and key oligarchs.

An internal battle within the EU is now raging between the 'Sanctionistas', countries that are pro-sanctions, and the Contras - countries prioritising their own economies.

One EU diplomat told The Times[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/7716537c-a51e-11ec-8cae-f1e364cbbd1a]: 'It’s becoming clearer by the day that three sides are forming: Poland and the Baltic states, known as the Sanctionistas that want more and stronger sanctions; Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria — the Contras — that prioritise their own economic interests; and the rest.'

The EU issued a fourth round of sanctions on Tuesday, but Germany is understood to have subsequently used meetings with at least three other governments to discuss calling a halt to further measures.

Instead, the Contras has suggested the bloc focus on 'closing loopholes' as opposed to imposing any further sanctions.

Poland, though, is furious that sanctions agreed earlier this week did not include metals oligarch Oleg Deripaska due to the potential impact it would have on aluminum production in Germany and other countries.

It comes days after a Russian attack on a military base just 12 miles from the Polish border in which at least nine people were killed and dozens more injured.

But the Contras moved to weaken a ban on new investment in joint energy ventures with Russian companies such as Gazprom and Rosneft.

Instead, a 'winding down' delay of six months was agreed.

Berlin has also secured exemptions on transactions that are said to be 'strictly necessary' to purchase, import and transport various metals including titanium, aluminium and copper.

The agreements, though, have been met with dismay among the Sanctionista countries on the border with Russia and Ukraine amid concerns over their proximity to the conflict.

It comes as the bombardment of Ukrainian cities contiues despite US officials estimating that at least 7,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the fighting and a further 14,000 to 21,000 wounded in action.

Kyiv was struck by missiles in the early hours of Thursday, with wreckage of one shot down rocket striking a 16-storey apartment block and killing one person.

Mariupol, the heavily besieged city in the south of Ukraine, also continued to come under heavy fire as city officials estimated that at least 2,400 people have now been killed there - though mayoral adviser Petro Andriushchenko said the true toll could be as high as 20,000 once cut-off areas have been searched for victims.

Andriushchenko spoke even before a theatre in the city housing up to 1,200 civilians was struck and destroyed by Russian forces Wednesday evening - despite having signs that said 'kids' in Russian positioned outside it.

President Volodymyr Zelensky called the attack 'heartbreaking', while Joe Biden branded Putin a 'war criminal.'

Casualties from the attack are unclear, but City officials said this morning that evacuations are now underway, and that a bomb shelter at the theatre survived the strike. It is unclear how many people were inside at the time.

Despite the mounting death toll, peace talks between the two sides are continuing with concrete proposals for a ceasefire being discussed.

Russian negotiators yesterday briefed journalists on their 15-point plan for peace, which would see Ukraine declare neutrality and place limits on its armed forces in return for Russian withdrawal.

Ukraine's chief negotiator Mikhailo Podolyak would not be drawn on the plan, saying only that the two sides had discussed it and it did not take Kyiv's negotiating position into account.

The proposal makes no mention of Crimea and Donbass - Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia and its proxies before the invasion - with President Zelensky later reiterating that his country's territorial integrity is not up for negotiation.

Italy seizes £97m Sardinian property owned by Russia's richest man Alexei Mordashov - as EU Officials discuss using sanctioned Russians' assets to help fund Ukraine's post-war recovery

* Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi's office confirmed the seizure on Friday

* He said the operation to seize the building complex was part of the Western drive to sanction Russian oligarchs close to Putin over the war in Ukraine

* It comes as reports said the EU is considering using assets as war reparations

* Ukraine continues to be bombarded with Russian artillery causing widespread death and destruction, as Putin's forces continue their assault on the country

Italy has seized a £97 million property complex owned by Russia's official richest man Alexei Mordashov, Prime Minister Mario Draghi's office said on Friday.

Italy's operation to seize the building complex on the Mediterranean island was part of a broad, Western drive to penalise wealthy Russians linked to President Vladimir Putin following the February 24 invasion of Ukraine.

It was the second time this month that assets belonging to Mordashov, reputed to be Russia's richest man, have been seized in Italy. Police on March 4 impounded his 215 ft yacht, the 'Lady M', which had a price tag of 65 million euros.

The news followed reports that the European Union is considering using assets seized from Russian oligarchs to help fund Ukraine's recovery efforts, as Vladimir Putin continues to lay siege to several of the country's major cities.

Such a scheme is still in its early stages, but sources in Brussels said one possibility would be to sell the assets in order to fun war reparations, which are unlikely to be forthcoming from Moscow.

Mordashov, 56, is the son of a mill worker who became a steel magnate with estimated net worth of $29.1 billion. He is believed to be the richest man in Russia, apart from possibly Vladimir Putin himself - whose true wealth is unknown.

Mordashov is also reportedly the president of Severgroup, an investment management company, and a shareholder in Bank Rossiya, which hit [https://www.ft.com/content/ac0bee28-b05a-11e3-8058-00144feab7de]by US government sanctions over being 'Putin's bank', according to the Financial Times.

In the last two weeks, Italian police have sequestered villas and yachts worth more than 780 million of euros from seven wealthy Russians who were placed on a European Union sanctions lists following the assault on Ukraine.

The most valuable asset seized so far is a superyacht owned by billionaire Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko, which is worth around 530 million euros and was impounded in the northern port of Trieste last Saturday.

The other Russians targeted so far in Italy are Alisher Usmanov, Vladimir Soloviev, Gennady Timchenko, Oleg Savchenko, Petr Aven.

According to Bloomberg[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-19/ukraine-update-russia-says-used-kinzhal-missile-in-strike], such assets could be used to help Ukraine recover from the war which, after less than a month, has seen widespread death and destruction - particularly in the country's east.

The outlet added that any decision over what to do with seized assets would ultimately fall to the EU's member states.

Eric Mamer, spokesman for European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, told Bloomberg: 'At this point the assets are only frozen. The president has not asked for this to be explored.'

Under EU sanctions, as well as similar schemes put in place by the likes of the US and the UK, Russian assets belonging to Russian oligarchs can be frozen.

On Thursday, the EU also announced that it was creating a 'freeze and seize' taskforce to share information among member states, and to implement the sanctions more effectively.

The bloc has said it will also cooperate with the Group of Seven (G7) countries on REPO (the 'Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs' task force), Bloomberg reported.

There is a growing concern over Ukraine's ability to withstand Russia's assault for much longer. Some cities, such as the port city of Mariupol, are under siege.

Moscow's armies are preventing aid from reaching the thousands of people still inside the city, while also preventing people from escaping.

According to Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk on Saturday, Ukraine has evacuated 190,000 civilians from front line areas via humanitarian corridors since the start of the war.

She said corridors in the Kyiv and Luhansk regions were functioning on Saturday, but a planned corridor to Mariupol was only partially operational, with buses not being allowed through by Russian troops.

Yesterday, a private jet owned by Roman Abramovich was among 100 planes essentially grounded by the White House as the US cracked down on aircraft that violated sanctions imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.

The US earlier this month banned American-made planes - or those with 25 percent American parts - from entering Russia without authorisation, but the Commerce Department said several aircraft had done so in contravention of the sanctions.

These include a Gulfstream G650ER owned by Abramovich, who also owns Chelsea football club, as well as Boeing 737 and 777 aircraft operated by Aeroflot.

According to flight tracking website Flight Radar, the most recent journey made by Abramovich's jet was flying from Istanbul, Turkey to Moscow on Tuesday (March 15). Before that, it had been in Tel Aviv in Israel from March 13 to 14.

A picture of the Russian oligarch at Tel Aviv airport appeared to confirm that he had flown to the country. Abramovich, who is of Jewish descent, has an Israeli passport.

The department warned that providing any service to the named plane, including refuelling, would violate US rules and could result in fines and jail time.

Abramovich, 55, was one of seven oligarchs sanctioned by Western governments - including the UK - earlier this month over his alleged close ties to Russia's President Vladimir Putin.

The billionaire, who counts Chelsea football club amongst his billions of pounds worth of assets in Britain, has denied his ties to the Russian leader.

Reports suggest he was the first person to recommend Putin for president to predecessor Boris Yeltsin, and has been a close confidant to the despot.

Meanwhile, the deadline for offers for the West London club has now passed, following Abramovich's decision to put the Blues up for sale on March 2.

'We are publishing this list to put the world on notice - we will not allow Russian and Belarusian companies and oligarchs to travel with impunity in violation of our laws,' Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement.

Western countries including the United States and the European Union have imposed stiff sanctions on a range of Russian industries and wealthy individuals seen as supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin and the invasion of Ukraine late last month. The penalties also targeted Belarus for its support.

All of the flights that violated the sanctions were operated or owned by Russian nationals, Commerce said.

Other planes Commerce identified include Boeing 777s and 737s operated by Nordwind Airlines, Boeing 767s and 737s flown by Utair, and Boeing 767s, 757s 777s and a 737 operated by Azur Air.

The department released specific tail numbers[https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2022/03/commerce-department-identifies-commercial-and-private-aircraft-exported], including 33 Boeing planes operated by Aeroflot , and 12 Boeing 747 cargo planes operated by AirBridge Cargo, a unit of Russia's biggest cargo airline Volga-Dnepr Group.

Aeroflot and a spokesperson for Abramovich did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters.

Volga-Dnepr declined to immediately comment but said Friday it has suspended all flights using Boeing aircraft citing sanctions and a decision by Bermuda's Civil Aviation Authority to terminate their safety certificates.

The United States, Canada and much of Europe have barred Russian planes from flying over their airspace, which has forced the cancellation of much of Russia's international flights.

The rules apply to any U.S. manufactured aircraft or any with more than 25 percent U.S.-origin controlled content that were re-exported to Russia after the new stringent controls on aviation-related items for Russia took effect on February 24.

Deputy Commerce Secretary Don Graves said in a statement the series of U.S. actions 'have isolated Russia and Belarus from the global economy, and I hope that today's action brings that fact home to the Russian businesses and oligarchs that seek to continue their operations.'

Report suggest Russian airlines have weeks to orchestrate alternative supplies of banned aircraft parts or start grounding jets to avoid safety concerns as Western sanctions following Russian's invasion of Ukraine threaten their post-Soviet revival.

Moscow took a first step this week towards keeping its commercial fleet flying by allowing its airlines to re-register leased planes in Russia, giving local authorities direct control over the certificates of airworthiness needed for each jet.

Western analysts say airlines may start stripping some of Russia's 500 foreign-leased jets within weeks or even days for parts while shopping around for genuine, but resold, parts from countries such as China.

Boeing said earlier this month it was suspending parts, maintenance and technical support for Russian airlines.

The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security said since March 2, based on publicly available information, it 'identified a number of commercial and private flights from third countries to Russia' and could add more planes as it continues its review.

Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod said the 'action lets Vladimir Putin's enablers know that, as a consequence of their actions, they have fewer places to hide and fewer ways to get there.'

China queried over Ukraine cyber activity

Cybersecurity analysts say China has targeted Ukraine with online attacks in Europe in the war with Russia.

Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) in a blogpost earlier this month identified a China-based hacking group in a list of “threat actors”, which also comprised Russian and Belarusian groups.

The blogpost, by Shane Huntley from the TAG, said a Russian group had conducted large “credential phishing campaigns” against Ukrainian media company UkrNet. A Belarusian group had targeted Polish and Ukrainian government and military organisations.

It said China-based threat actor “Mustang Panda or Temp. Hex” had targeted European organisations with emails with malicious attachments containing executable code. TAG had alerted authorities of its findings.

Targeting of European organisations has represented a shift from Mustang Panda’s regularly observed Southeast Asian targets,” said Google TAG in the blogpost.

China at the time fiercely denied the claim, telling Forbes that it was a staunch defender of cyber security and a main victim of cyber attacks, and that it was “important to have complete and sufficient evidence when investigating and defining cyber-related incidents”.

However, self-described China focused cybersecurity monitor “Intrusion Truth” said there was evidence of Chinese participation online in the Ukraine crisis.

“Intrusion Truth now knows that Chinese hackers are conducting cyber attacks against Ukraine. We can only assume these have been ordered, or are at least condoned, by the Chinese state,” it said on Twitter.

Intrusion Truth is yet to reveal any specific evidence it has.

The group gained notoriety in 2017 for revealing Chinese hacking groups and the names of hackers working for Chinese intelligence.

In Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison has foreshadowed sanctions against China if it were to provide Russia with military equipment, but it is less clear that Australia or the US would sanction China over this level of online activity, if it had happened.

US president Joe Biden last week warned about consequences if China provided “material support” to Russia. China has said it opposes war and stands for peace, but it has not condemned Moscow’s actions in Ukraine.

Meanwhile a cyberattack against Viasat’s satellite servicing Europe, on the day of the invasion in late February, has authorities worried that if provoked, Russia might try to severely disrupt communications across Europe.

Viasat is a contractor for the Ukrainian military and other Western militaries, including the US and Australia.

On that day internet connectivity in Europe dropped to about 20 per cent, the report said.

Experts said the attack may have knocked out services beyond what Russia had intended.

In this case the attack impacted internet users as far away as France. According to reports, services were also drastically reduced in Germany, Hungary, Greece, Italy and Poland.

Co-founder and CEO of Internet 2.0 Robert Potter said China had a vested interest in the conflict and wanted to know what the Ukrainian government was thinking, but that was not the same necessarily as assisting Russia with a destructive campaign.

Mr Potter said Australia used a different geo-stationary satellite to Europe’s, but the incident did raise the dependence on satellite communications by both military and civilians and the increasing likelihood of satellites being targeted by hostile nations.

Russia-Ukraine war: Germany, Italy and Hungary resist Europe to stop buying Russian hydrocarbons

Europe pays Russia every day, for gas and oil imports, more than 800 million euros

, almost 300 billion euros a year. Enough to finance a few wars.The European sanctions against Moscow, especially the economic ones, such as the freezing of more than 300 billion euros of assets of its Central Bank, are damaging the Russian economy, but it does not seem that the damage is enough

to make President Vladimir Putin change his attitude.The Europeans are left with a sanction that would bring Russia to its knees economically: to apply a practically total trade blockade

that would include a ban on importing Russian gas, oil and coal into Europe.The economic blow to Moscow would be enormous, but it would also be a considerable blow to some European countries

, especially those further east and those most dependent on Russian gas to run their industry.The meeting of European foreign ministers on Monday in Brussels, preparatory to the summit of heads of state and government on Thursday and Friday (which will be attended by the American Joe Biden, visiting the Belgian capital for the NATO summit on the same Thursday), focused basically on the next round of sanctions,

already the fifth, and on whether the veto on Russian hydrocarbons will be included in it.TheEuropean Chancellor, the Spanish-Argentinean Josep Borrell, asked the chancellors to impose sanctions on the energy sector. The Czech, Slovak, Slovenian and Irish chancellors joined the request that the Polish, Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian have been making for days: we must stop buying Russian gas and oil

because if we do not do so Europe is financing Putin's war.The foreign ministers did not reach an agreement. While eight countries are pushing for this veto to be activated and a majority of governments would follow this plan without much fuss, the German, Italian and Hungarian executives are refusing

. German Minister Annalena Baerbock said at the start of the meeting that Berlin will eliminate its dependence on Russian hydrocarbons "gradually and at full speed".If that means anything. Germany is refusing because of the impact it would have on its industry, something Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelenski chided the Bundestag for in his speech to German MPs last week.

Italy is more discreet but is also against this trade ban

on Russian hydrocarbons. The Italian industry is one of the most well-connected with Moscow in Europe. The Hungarian veto is more political, because of the good relations between Prime Minister Viktor Orban and the Russian president.Hungary will not support sanctioning Russian hydrocarbon exports because it considers that it would jeopardize its energy security

. Peter Szijjártó, Hungarian Chancellor, said Monday in Brussels, "We do not support sanctions that would endanger Hungary's energy security." Hungary depends on its neighbors.The problemsIfUkraine, Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria...decide to turn off the taps, Russian oil and gas will not reach it

.Economic institutes and think tanks in Brussels and other capitals have already calculated the economic cost to Europe if it were to make such a decision. They believe that turning off the oil tap will make it more expensive but can be replaced by imports from other suppliers. Stopping buying Russian gas immediately would be more difficult. Nearly 40% of the natural gas consumed in Europe is purchased from Russia.

A part could be replaced by more imports from Algeria (through Spain and Italy) and from Norway. Another part could come by increasing the number of LNG tankers bringing liquefied gas to European ports, mainly from the United States, Qatar and Nigeria, for regasification in Europe.

That idea has limitations until more regasification plants are built

because right now more than a third of the total number of such plants in Europe are in Spain and there are not enough gas pipelines to France to greatly increase gas transport. The final solution would be to reduce demand for natural gas by 10% to 15%.The meeting of chancellors also served for the 27 to approve the doubling, from 500 to 1,000 million, of the Community budget to pay for arms and send them to Ukraine. Germany on its own will put in another 1 billion.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called on the Italian parliament to freeze all the assets of the Russian elite and declare a full trade embargo, including oil, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported, quoting Zelensky's video address to Italian MPs.

"You know very well who orders troops to go to war and who propagates this. Almost all of them use Italy as a place to rest. Do not be a resort for murderers. Freeze all their property, accounts and yachts. Freeze all the assets of those who have influence, let them use it for peace. Support sanctions against Russia, a full trade embargo, starting with oil," Zelensky said.

He also asked Italy to ban Russian ships from entering Italian ports and sanction all Russian banks.

Activists linked to Alexei Navalny believe the Scheherazade is owned by the Russian president

For several months, the mysterious 140-metre-long, six-floor superyacht has towered over the smaller boats in the shipyard in Marina di Carrara, a town on Italy’s Tuscan coast, arousing chatter among its people over the identity of its wealthy owner.

“It’s the largest yacht I’ve ever seen here,” said Suzy Dimitrova, who owns a boat in the marina. “There are people cleaning it all the time. The last time I saw it leave [the shipyard] was last year. We’re all wondering who the owner is.”

The Scheherazade, said to be worth $700m (£528m), is under investigation by Italian authorities for potential links to sanctioned Russians. And activists working with the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny are in no doubt that the yacht is owned by the Russian president Vladimir Putin.

On Monday, investigative journalist Maria Pevchikh and anti-corruption activist Georgy Alburov said that all crew members, obtained from a list dating December 2020, were Russian, apart from the captain. In a video published on YouTube, they claimed that some of the yacht’s staff worked for the Russia’s Federal Protective Service (FSO), an agency that manages security for high-ranking officials including Putin.

The activists, who have urged Italian authorities to seize the yacht, said this information proves it belongs to Putin. “They are Russian state employees, military personnel, and they regularly travel to Italy as a group to work on the mysterious yacht,” Pevchikh wrote on Twitter.

The interior of the vessel was described as being equipped with a spa, swimming pools, two helipads, a wood-burning fireplace and a pool table designed to tilt so as to reduce the impact of the waves.

In an address to the Italian parliament on Tuesday, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Italy to seize the yacht, adding that Putin and his wealthy supporters often holidayed in Italy and should have their assets blocked.

“Don’t be a resort for murderers,” he said. “Lock all their real estate, accounts and yachts – from the Scheherazade to the smallest ones.”

Putin’s last official visit to Italy was in 2019, at the invitation of the former prime minister, Giuseppe Conte. He also held talks with Pope Francis at the Vatican during the visit.

Marina di Carrara is close to Forte dei Marmi, a favourite holiday destination for Russian oligarchs, many of whom have bought villas and beach resorts.

In early March, Italian police seized a yacht owned by Alexei Mordashov, the richest man in Russia before being blacklisted by the European Union,[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/02/alexei-mordashov-russias-richest-man-is-now-an-eu-sanctions-target] and another owned by Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire with close ties to Putin[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/russian-sanctions-who-has-been-hit-and-who-might-be-next], in the Ligurian port of Imperia.

The yacht can only be seen through a fence, where it is continuing to undergo a refit, scheduled to be completed next year, in a shipyard owned by The Italian Sea Group, a company that refits and builds luxury yachts.

The mystery over its owner gathered momentum in early March, when finance police in Carrara boarded the yacht as EU sanctions against Russian oligarchs kicked in over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The police seized ownership documents from the yacht’s British captain, Guy Bennett-Pearce. At the time, US officials told the New York Times that they were also investigating whether the yacht belonged to Putin.

The Italian Sea Group said in a statement that it was continuing to work on the ship’s €6m (£5m) refit and maintenance despite the EU’s sanctions and that, according to documents in its possession, the vessel “is not attributable to the property of the Russian president Vladimir Putin”, and neither is it owned by a Russian on the sanction list.

A source at the finance police unit in Carrara said that they are now aware who the owner is and will soon make an announcement.

An investigation by La Stampa newspaper earlier this month had linked the vessel to Eduard Yurievich Khudainatov, the former president of the Russian state oil firm Rosneft, via a shell company registered in the Marshall Islands.

But Italian police are reportedly certain that Khudainatov is not the yacht’s real owner. “He seems to be a man connected with Putin’s inner circle but not so rich as to own a yacht like the Scheherazade,” said Jacopo Iacoboni, the journalist for La Stampa who carried out the investigation.

Until the Italian police reveal their findings, the people of Marina di Carrara continue to ponder, even if its presence causes concern. “Putin is the presumed owner, and looking at it now causes me a lot of anxiety because of what he is doing in Ukraine,” said Maria Cristina.

However, there are no signs of protests being planned. “There are always a lot of words, but little action here,” said Dimitrova.

The Ukraine Crisis: Oligarchs' Yachts Hit the High Seas

BARCELONA -- Just a few weeks ago, the Galactica Super Nova, a 230-foot yacht, was up for sale here.

Potential buyers from the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates had recently been aboard the vessel, which comes with a waterfall and an infinity pool on one of its upper decks -- and a price tag of about $83 million.

But on Feb. 25, a day after Russia invaded Ukraine, the ship's captain returned early from vacation, showing up pierside. He gave the crew 48 hours to get ready to sail. "We are leaving Sunday," he ordered, a person aboard at the time said. The ship got under way a full day ahead of that schedule.

Galactica is owned by Vagit Alekperov, president, chief executive and the largest shareholder of Russian oil company Lukoil, according to SuperYacht Fan, which maintains a database of owners of the world's biggest yachts, and according to a former crew member. Mr. Alekperov also owns the shipyard that built the yacht.

Mr. Alekperov isn't under sanctions, but he is on a Treasury list of political figures and oligarchs the U.S. says have close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. That makes his yacht a potential target in any subsequent sanctions. Lukoil didn't respond to a request to comment on behalf of Mr. Alekperov.

The Ukraine invasion and the raft of sanctions the West has unleashed in response have triggered a scramble among Russia's richest people to move their biggest assets out from under the threat of the widening restrictions. Western capitals have imposed sanctions on Russia's central bank, other banks and companies and individuals they hope will exert pressure on Mr. Putin.

Governments can freeze assets of individuals under sanction indefinitely, without proving criminality. Sanctions can be challenged, but the legal effort can take years.

Amid this broader dragnet, the superyachts of Russia's super rich have taken on outsize symbolism. France and Italy, in sometimes dramatic operations, have seized a handful of vessels they say belong to sanctioned individuals. In Norway, a Russian-linked yacht is stuck there because no one will sell it fuel. Another yacht, owned by a sanctioned Russian businessman, was partly scuttled by its chief mechanic, a Ukrainian, on the island of Majorca. The vessel was later seized by Spanish authorities.

President Biden, addressing Russia's politically connected elite, promised in his State of the Union address in late February to "find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets."

A few days after setting sail from Barcelona, the Galactica arrived in Tivat, Montenegro. Montenegro isn't a EuropeanUnion member, so isn't beholden to EU sanctions. The day the yacht pulled in, however, the country's government said it would join in enforcing EU sanctions. The Galactica was on its way before dawn the next day, according to ship-tracking sites.

On March 8, another yacht pulled out of Barcelona: the 460-foot Solaris, owned by Russian oil tycoon Roman Abramovich. The ship had been undergoing repairs when it made preparations to depart Barcelona. "It was clear that they wanted to leave the port as soon as possible," said a worker at the port.

Solaris eventually arrived in Tivat, too, where it anchored. Nobody left the ship, according to dockworkers, whose view of a small village across the bay was completely obscured by the towering vessel. An employee of a yacht agency in Tivat boarded the Solaris just long enough to check the passports and paperwork of the 50-odd crew, an executive at the port said.

Solaris's captain had planned to take on fuel, this executive said, but he scrapped the idea and departed hastily, instead. Representatives for Mr. Abramovich haven't responded to requests to comment.

The yacht is currently off the coast of Turkey, according to ship-tracking websites.

The radio-positioning beacon of the Galactica Super Nova was switched off shortly after leaving Tivat, making it impossible to track. A yacht fan spotted it in Turkey, however, and sent a photo to a YouTube channel popular with yacht watchers.

Other vessels owned by Russian oligarchs haven't made it to open water. Several days after the start of the invasion, Spain's General Directorate of the Merchant Marine circulated a message to harbor authorities asking them to report Russian-owned or -managed megayachts, without giving any explanation.

Spanish officials boarded the Valerie, a 280-foot yacht, while it was in Barcelona. They said they are investigating the ship's ownership. SuperYacht Fan lists the ship as being owned by Russian oligarch Sergei Chemezov, head of state defense contractor Rostec. Rostec didn't respond to a request to comment.

In the Norwegian fiord town of Narvik, Rob Lancaster is the captain of Ragnar, whose corporate record indicates it is owned by a company with at least one Russian director. SuperYacht Fan cites the owner as Vladimir Strzhalkovsky, a former KGB intelligence officer, who isn't under sanctions. Representatives of Mr. Strzhalkovsky couldn't be reached.

That association has drawn unwanted local notice. Police boarded the ship on March 2, checked the vessel's documents, and then left, Capt. Lancaster said. Since the invasion started, he said the vessel has been refused refueling by local suppliers.

"We did not realize why there was so much fuss with us," the captain said. "It happened so quickly."

WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: Erin Burnett OUTFRONT starts right now.

ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST: OUTFRONT next breaking news, intense fighting breaking out just outside of Kyiv tonight as Ukrainian forces make more gains around their capital. With Putin growing more desperate, the United States is preparing for a possible chemical weapons attack in Ukraine.

Plus, the man in charge of Putin's war not seen in public for more than a week. Who is Sergei Shoigu and where is he?

And a mystery, $700 million yacht docked in Italy now. It's got two helicopter pads, a hanger inside, a gold toilet paper holders, does it belong to Vladimir Putin? My guest tonight will show you the proof she says that it does. Let's go OUTFRONT.

And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett.

OUTFRONT tonight breaking news, intense fighting breaking out tonight just outside Ukraine's capital city. As we are just getting new drone video from the town of Vulytsya Popovych, just 12 miles west of Kyiv. You can look at this and see the widespread devastation, buildings on fire.

The Mayor they're telling CNN, it is extremely dangerous there tonight as Russian forces are shelling the town. The shelling comes as Ukrainian forces though are making significant gains tonight around Kyiv retaking territory east of the city. You can see what appear to be Ukrainian soldiers surrounding a Russian tank here. We're hearing from another soldier in that particular town who said, "We are advancing along the entire front line. We are advancing successfully. We will keep this village."

Well, the cost of the fighting is catastrophic, though. This is new video in from Mariupol in the south of Ukraine. The city council posted this. This devastation is hard to fathom, this part where they literally drive underneath the cell tower and then they show you the buildings, you got burned out cars lining all the streets when they show you out the window, apartment buildings, as they drive by just completely bombed out.

This sure looks like in a sort of aftermath of Chernobyl, exterior wall is all that is left of this building you're seeing coming up here on the left. It is just unbelievable. This is a city that was home to 350,000 or more people a month ago. We have no idea how many are still left there.

Tonight, Ukraine is putting a price on what this fight is formally telling the United States that it needs 500-anti aircraft missiles and 500 anti-tank missiles a day to keep fighting the Russians a day. Now, there is no response from the U.S. government yet on that. But in Brussels tonight, President Biden put Putin on notice should he choose to use chemical weapons.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would the U.S. or NATO respond with military action if he did use chemical weapons?

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BURNETT: Now, there are fears Putin could be on the path to using chemical weapons. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy today making this very specific claim about an attack in eastern Ukraine.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through interpreter): Today, by the way, there were phosphorus bombs in the morning, phosphorus Russian bombs. Adults were killed again and children were killed again.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BURNETT: Phosphorus causes severe burns. It is a violation of international law to use it in any attack on civilians. NATO Secretary General tonight says the alliance has mobilized its chemical weapon defenses.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: Our top Military Commander General Wolters has activated NATO's chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defense elements and allies are deploying additional chemical and biological and nuclear defenses to reinforce our existing and new battle groups.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BURNETT: Our Sam Kiley is OUTFRONT live in Kyiv tonight. Phil Mattingly is in Brussels with President Biden at that NATO meeting. Sam, let me begin with you as we're showing devastation on the ground near where you are, but also the Ukrainian forces appearing to notch some more significant victories around Kyiv. What is the latest tonight?

SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I mean, I think the most dramatic event has been the Ukrainian forces attack in Berdyansk where they knocked out and blew up a Russian ship that was docked in the dock there in this very important port city. Massive explosion followed by several other what they call secondary explosions. That's when the ammunition or fuel or both inside that ship is detonating.

Now, in and of itself, not necessarily a significant strategic move by the Ukrainians but a good illustration of how they're trying to put to best use the sort of weapons that they're demanding, begging NATO to increase their supplies to them.

[19:05:01]

And now they've going through what NATO has estimated what the Ukrainians could use over a week that the Ukrainians are saying they're going through in a 24-hour period, they have been enjoying a degree of success here in Kyiv, pushing back the forces in Makariv to the west around Irpin. We're just showing those pictures of drone images from the northwest of Kyiv. These were all consequences of the ongoing fighting that is very intense, Erin, to the northwest and now I was just today in the east of the city where they are also claiming a number of successes.

But these are all about protecting Kyiv. They haven't necessarily got control at all of the battlespace elsewhere in the country. And of course, Mariupol, you were showing those images, they're extraordinary images of this completely destroyed city going to go down in history as one of the iconic destructions of an entire city conducted in any age.

But this one really, really, really dramatic, very important location, controlling the last piece of government territory on the Azov Sea. Still the Ukrainians are holding out. Still they're desperately asking for those weapons, Erin.

BURNETT: It is incredible, just that picture driving along that edge of the town under that fallen tower. Sam Kiley, thank you so much, reporting live from Kyiv tonight.

Let's go to Brussels where Phil Mattingly is. He is covering President Biden's trip to meet with NATO leaders. So Phil, we hear President Biden say the U.S. and NATO will respond if Putin uses chemical weapons, but he's very careful to not say how. To say it would depend on what the use was. So what is the President's thinking on this right now?

PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Erin, we've gotten a sense of the scale of the concern with U.S. officials over the course of the last several days with their public statements, increasingly public warnings to President Putin warnings that a chemical attack may be imminent. It was a central point of discussion here in Brussels with NATO leaders, with EU leaders about what may happen, what people are seeing and what the response would be.

But perhaps more important at this point in time is what's been happening behind the scenes just four days after Russia launched its invasion, the National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, signed a directive creating a special team of individuals known as a Tiger Team to start working through potential contingency plans related to bio weapons attack related to chemical attacks, related to potential incursions into NATO territory, and potentially Russian strikes on supply chain convoys.

Those are all issues that have been working through the White House system over the course of the last several weeks multiple meetings a day going through contingency plans and options. And if it sounds familiar, it is, there was a tiger team set up in the lead up to the Russia invasion to ensure that if the invasion did in fact occur, which U.S. officials have become increasingly convinced would happen in the weeks leading up to it, the U.S. and perhaps most importantly, its Western allies would be prepared to respond.

And we've seen the scale of the response, that still escalating today, more sanctions, more humanitarian assistance, more aid to refugees. And I think it's important to note that when you listen to the President today, so much of the talk was about unity. Yes, that's about the sanctions regime. Yes, that's about weapons and lethal assistance and humanitarian aid, but it's also about what may come next and there's no question about it. U.S. officials are very concerned that a chemical attack may be one of those things and the West will need to stay united on that front as well, Erin.

BURNETT: All right. Phil, thank you very much.

I want to go down to the former Director of National Intelligence, retired Lieutenant General James Clapper. And General, let me ask you about this, President Biden says today, "We would respond if Putin used chemical weapons." Now, he very clearly did not say exactly how, what would you advise President Biden to do if Putin uses chemical weapons?

LT. GEN. JAMES CLAPPER (RET.), CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, this is a question, Erin, that I need to salute humility before responding. And I think the President was right to not specify just what we do because it will be, if there is such an incident, very situational dependent. Having said all that, my advice would be if infringes - if there is such a chemical attack, we can confirm it and all of that, that we respond in a conventional manner kinetically and try to find some linkage between as a target between the chemical attack and its origins. That would be my advice. Again, all do humility, and you have to, I mean, this is tough stuff and it's very situational-dependent.

BURNETT: So the thing about chemical and any sort of a tactical nuclear strike, whether it'd be mines or something thing is that obviously you can ensure that it would stay localized. [19:10:04]

So if Russia were to use chemical or nuclear tactical weapons, the chemicals, the radiation could move, right? Could waft on the winds, could go to NATO countries, Europe, would you consider that an attack on NATO?

CLAPPER: Again, it would depend on the situation. For me if it affected any people in NATO territory, if it affected - if it damaged property, facilities on NATO territory, I would consider that an attack.

BURNETT: So that brings me then to the what. I mean, NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg tells CNN today that he thinks it's still unlikely there will be a full-fledged war between Russia and NATO. Do you agree with that at this point?

CLAPPER: Well, not exactly. I mean, the Secretary General almost has to say that for public consumption. At the same time, the likelihood of this happening, though, is greater than it ever has been since World War II, you just can't ignore that in my mind.

BURNETT: So the Ukrainian government says Russian forces looted and destroyed a lab near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant that had some highly radioactive waste and the lab was used to monitor that. There were these samples that were highly toxic. This is what they're saying.

Obviously, we can't confirm the specifics on this, but this is something you've been extremely worried about. When you hear that reporting, what do you say?

CLAPPER: Well, as you know, Erin, we discussed this before, I've been very concerned about the 15 nuclear reactors in Ukraine and the very cavalier, reckless way the Russians have regarded them. So if there is an inadvertent attack or a witting attack, if power is cut off, which prevents a cooling of radioactive material, there just all kinds of potential here for a real catastrophe.

And it would be Chernobyl to 2.0 and it wouldn't just affect Ukraine, this would be a regional disaster. So I'm very concerned about that and anything to do where the Russians are attacking or looting or whatever they're doing that relates to a nuclear facility is dangerous.

BURNETT: Gen. Clapper. Thank you very much. I appreciate your time.

CLAPPER: Thanks, Erin.

BURNETT: And next questions growing about the man leading Putin's war, the Russian Defense Minister. He actually has not been seen in public for at least a week. And according to the Pentagon, he is not answering any calls from his U.S. counterpart. So where is Sergei Shoigu?

Plus, is this Putin's yacht? It has a dance floor that turns into a swimming pool, gold toilet paper roll holders. It is the example of excess. We're learning a lot more about this mysterious and massive ship tonight docked in Italy.

And the country is still propping up Putin's invasion, paying Russia for oil, weapons, even fertilizer, so who's still on that list? You're going be really surprised.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[19:17:05]

BURNETT: Russia trying to silence speculation surrounding defense minister Sergei Shoigu who hasn't been seen in public for at least a week, in the middle of this massive war. State-run Russia TV, 24 TV interrupted a live interview today. They interrupted a live interview to cut to a few seconds of a video that shows Shoigu.

He's there on the screen in one of the boxes on the Zoom. Zoom similar appearing to brief President Putin. It's not clear when that video of him was actually taken. The Pentagon, meantime, saying Shoigu has been declining calls from his U.S. counterpart even before the invasion began. Tom Foreman is OUTFRONT in Washington.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In the earliest days of the war, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was in plain sight, the long standing and well known face of the military. Now in recent weeks, he's been all but invisible. He can be seen briefly in this video newly released by state owned television, but it's not clear when it was recorded. He is not wearing his uniform and he does not speak, so speculation about Shoigu's position is running wild.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ANDREI SOLDATOV, RUSSIAN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST: Everything about the reputation of the Russian military, it is about Shoigu, so he needs to be present. He needs to be visible for this very reason and he's not.

VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through interpreter): Mr. Shoigu, your assessment?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

FOREMAN (voice over): Shoigu came into the war firmly behind Russia's stance on Ukraine. Even as his armies' advanced bogged down and casualties mounted, he told Putin on March 11th, all is going according to the plan. His loyalty to Putin is widely considered unshakable. Their relationship stretching back decades to include not just work, but also shared vacations, riding horses, fishing, relaxing in the Russian countryside.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SOLDATOV: He was always, always extremely loyal to Putin, never questioned his actions, never showed any ambitions to become someone bigger than the Minister of Defense. That's his thing, to stay loyal to Putin.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

FOREMAN (voice over): Yet, when CNN asked a Kremlin spokesperson to explain Shoigu's sudden disappearance, the answer was terse. The defense minister has a lot on his plate at the moment now is not exactly the time for media activity. And it all comes in the wake of a Reuters report that another Putin insider has quit his job and left the country over the war with Ukraine.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

FOREMAN (on camera): For now, it's anyone's guess what has happened to the Defense Minister. All we really know is that he is missing in action, with no real explanation as to why, Erin.

BURNETT: All right. Thank you very much, Tom.

So let's get some more on that. Evelyn Farkas is the Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense.

[19:20:01]

And Evelyn, you've met Sergei Shoigu. You're one of the few who actually can put personal aspect of this. We see him shirts off, hanging out fishing with Vladimir Putin. They're close. Putin loves those pictures. He let Shoigu get in one with him. What is Sergei Shoigu like and why do you think Putin did trust him so much or I'm using the past tense here, does, perhaps, we don't know.

EVELYN FARKAS, FORMER U.S. DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR RUSSIA/UKRAINE/EURASIA: Yes, Erin. So all accounts of Sergei Shoigu before I actually met him in person was that he was a personable, agreeable guy, quick to smile. The North Koreans always like round faces. They think they're friendly. He kind of looks the part, he looks friendly.

He was known as a very good manager. And that's actually why Vladimir Putin picked him because his predecessor was a corrupt former furniture salesperson, salesman, and wasn't doing a good job. The military did not have confidence in him.

So he brought in Shoigu who for 20 years was the head of the federal emergencies ministry, which is sort of like a FEMA on steroids. And Shoigu was this likable guy. He was very loyal to Putin. I met him in 2013, when we had a meeting, a bilateral meeting here actually in Washington. And he got along well enough with Secretary Hagel, who was our Secretary of Defense at the time and with a Secretary Kerry, who was also at the meeting.

And then as you said, he was a frequent companion, at least, in the media of Vladimir Putin's going hunting with him, he was an outdoorsman. He was never seen as a threat to Putin, because he's from Tuva out in the East and, also, I think he has mixed ethnicity. So he's not a Russian, Russian, ethnically pure Russian.

And so for whatever reason, that was regarded, he was regarded not as a threat to Putin, but as a loyalist and somebody who could help him really build up the military, which still needed very much building up and so he was in charge of the modernization that Putin launched (inaudible) ...

BURNETT: It's amazing when you talk about how much ethnicity matters and I know he's from an oblast, kind of similar to a state or region that borders Mongolia.

State TV showed a brief video of him today, Evelyn, of course, it was pre recorded. We don't know when. He didn't speak and it was not wearing his military uniform. This is the guy who's supposedly in charge of the entire ministry of defense in the biggest war in decades for Russia, what do you read into this?

FARKAS: I'm worried about what happened to him. It may not be him at all. Certainly, if he's not wearing his uniform, that's the signal. He's being sidelined. He's worn his uniform in all the pictures. And frankly, Putin already put a couple of high-ranking intelligence officers in house arrest, because of this botched campaign.

In the past, we've seen the head of the GRU, the military intelligence. In 2016 or 2018, he suddenly died after meeting with Vladimir Putin and that was in the face of failures. The failure to poison Mr. Skripal if you remember with novichok, in the U.K. that was botched. It was uncovered by the West. So maybe something is happening to Shoigu along those lines, either house arrest or perhaps worse.

BURNETT: Unbelievable. All right. Thank you very much, Evelyn. I appreciate your time.

And next, another mystery. This $700 million yacht right now, as I speak, it's docked in a port in central Italy and it's - look, those are not brass. Those are real gold. Gold toilet paper roll holders, so whose is it? Well, my next guest and has done exhaustive reporting, wait till you see this. She says it's Putin's.

Plus more breaking news, new text messages from the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, telling Trump's chief of staff to overturn the election.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[19:27:47]

BURNETT: Tonight, Italy's financial police in the midst of an investigation to determine if Vladimir Putin owns this giant yacht. It's the one right in the center of your screen like the massive one and it dwarfs everything else. It's estimated be worth $700 million. It's at an Italian marina tonight.

The Anti Corruption Foundation headed by top Putin critic Alexey Navalny has done incredible work on this and says that they can prove it belongs to Putin after extensive investigative work. They're now calling for the yacht to be seized.

Now, it is a yacht like no other, with one worker who helped build it telling The Sun in London, "It's like a mini city." It has a tiled dance floor that turns into a swimming pool. A giant seating area that's as big as a hotel lobby. The dining area has just one table with seats for 20. There are gold toilet paper roll holders in the bathrooms.

OUTFRONT now, Maria Pevchik. She is the head of the investigative department with Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation. And Maria, your reporting on this has been exhaustive just so incredibly thorough. I will note, of course, we haven't been able to confirm who owns the yacht, but tell me what you discovered in your investigation when you went through painstakingly the crew, and who they are and where they're from that led you to conclude that this is, in fact, Vladimir Putin's yacht.

MARIA PEVCHIK, INVESTIGATIVE DEPT. HEAD, NAVALNY'S ANTI-CORRUPTION FOUNDATION: Well, hello, good evening. Well, we've been investigating Putin's corruption for over a decade and if there is one golden rule about how Putin's corruption works is that Putin never ever keeps his assets under his own name. That's just impossible.

So he uses this network of people, his friends from childhood, friends from university, friends from KGB, relatives, et cetera, to store his huge wealth and they act as nominee shareholders. So straightaway we knew that. It's absolutely - it is completely irrelevant who actually owns this yacht on paper. It could be anyone.

It could be a random person, a passerby, it really doesn't matter. The way to prove, there is one way to prove that something belongs to Putin and this is done by looking into who manages an asset like that.

[19:30:00]

So we obtained a crew list, so a list of every employee on this yacht and what stood out straight away was that pretty much everybody but the captain were Russians. They all had Russian passport numbers, had visa numbers, and they had Russian names.

It was few dozen of them so we decided to just go one by one by one, checking them on every data base we have access to. And we have access to a lot of them because Russia is a very corrupt country and so many databases have been leaked. You can purchase any sort of data on the black market.

So we just started to go person by person, and I don't know, seconds in (ph), we hit it. Turns up he is referred in other peoples' phone books as working for, as an employee of FSO, this is a militarized government agency that is responsible for Putin's personal protocol- based security. This is the agency that maintains his official residences, that provides security for Putin, et cetera.

And as we kept going down the list, there was another employee, and another one, and another one, and it all added up. These peoples' job is literally to protect Vladimir Putin, this is what they do, this is what they're paid for by the taxpayers. Why, on earth, would they all, as a group, travel to Italy regularly to work part-time on one of the most expensive yachts in the world? Only one explanation, and that's that it's Putin's yacht.

BURNETT: That it's his. So, you have called for, you know, this yacht to be seized as in fact others have in Italy and other countries have been able belong to oligarchs.

You know, you've done incredible detailed reporting on what's in the yacht -- six guest cabins, six levels, an entire deck just for the owner and that person's companion. Jacuzzi's elevator shafts, hanger for a helicopter when it actually lands, two pads, I know, but there's a place it literally opens up so the helicopter can go in. All of this is your reporting.

And this stands out, it seems, even compared to other excesses we have seen on these Russian yachts.

PEVCHIKH: Well, does it really, like it's, have you seen Putin's palace? Have you seen the other things that Putin owns? His taste is very questionable and we know that he, his rule of thumb is if something is expensive and gold, he loves it.

So I'm really not surprised by what's inside the yacht and I'm sure there's plenty of other exciting things there we don't know about it yet and that we will find out. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing more pictures and I'm sure they will leak.

BURNETT: Yes, and I do note, need to make sure we say this, the yacht's captain denied Putin owned or has been on the yacht to "The New York Times", and the shipyard manager denied to CNN that but Italian police say the issue of ownership is under their investigation. I want to ask you one other crucial thing that you've done so much work on and I've been watching.

The U.K. sanctioned over 1,000 individuals and businesses because of Putin's invasion of Ukraine and got new sanctions today that targeted somebody that you've done a lot of reporting on, Polina Kovaleva. She is step daughter of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, lives an incredibly gilded life with parties and yachts and dancing and drinking. What do you make of this decision to target not just Russian oligarchs but family members, or even, you know, the -- I don't know that she's formally a stepdaughter, but I don't think he's married to her mother -- but people who are close to the lives of these inner circle and wealthy Russians?

PEVCHIKH: I think this is just brilliant, and I think every country now should do the same and the U.K. has set a very high bar, very good standard for sanctions, and it's -- they have taken it to a different level, because again, corrupt people don't just put assets under their own name. They use other people. They use their relatives, sometimes very distant relatives sometimes, just their friends, et cetera, to keep the money they have stolen from the Russian taxpayers.

So including people like, including people like Lavrov's step daughter, one official step-daughter into the list is a very good move and what needs to happen now is that the sanctions, they just need to expand and more people need to be brought in into this circle, so immediate official family first. Then, I don't know, lovers, mistresses, their children, et cetera. Then, friends, close associates, et cetera.

[19:35:02]

It's like this game, you know, for kids like whack-a-mole, you know? Those guys rearranged their finances so quickly that you need to be very swift, very quick and just, you know, shut them down every mouse, and make sure they cannot find a different solution to keep their money in.

BURNETT: Yeah. Well, Maria, thank you so much. I mean, as you point out, people start looking -- you look at the mistresses and the ex- wives and where the money can be going, a lot that can be done, if you buy into the fact that stopping the money flow matters. There's a lot more to be done but this is a huge step, and I know including her was I'm sure, in large part, due to your work. Thank you so much.

PEVCHIKH: Thank you very much, Erin.

BURNETT: And next, the biggest democracy in the world, yet India is the one openly choosing to openly pad Putin's pockets. That's not the only country tonight.

And the shocking text messages from the wife of Supreme Court Clarence Thomas. We're learning tonight that she pressured Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows to overturn the election, writhing and I quote, the majority knows Biden and the left is attempting the greatest heist of our history.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[19:40:08]

BURNETT: German chancellor Olaf Scholz conceding that European nations made a, quote, very conscious decision to not sanction Russia's number one export and money maker, oil and gas. It comes as President Biden used his NATO meetings to tout the sweeping penalties and U.S. and NATO allies designed to, quote, cripple Vladimir Putin's economy. Hard to cripple something when you're not taking out the biggest part of it.

And what he didn't say was that there are still many countries, including members of NATO who are propping up Russia and funding this war by continuing to do business there.

Gabe Cohen is OUTFRONT.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As Putin's international support shrinks, India is showing they're still a friend, reportedly buying up 3 million barrels of discounted Russian oil, spurring pressure from Western nations like the U.S. to isolate the Kremlin and crush their economy with sanctions. Since the war started, the two nations kept trading with Russian oil exports to India up 6-fold, that cheap oil is just a drop in the bucket for India which imports far more from other countries. But it reflects the strategic partnership neither nation wants to lose.

VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): India is one of Russia's key partners. The relationship between our states is of strategic and special privileged nature.

COHEN: It's a bond build on defense spending. India buys somewhere 60 and 85 percent of weapons from Russia, key to containing Pakistan and China along their border, while India is slowly diversifying that spending, there is still another contract to buy $5.4 billion air defense system from Russia, along with $1.3 billion line of tanks.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you can't certainly break that relationship. Indian defense prepared, as it were, is going to be very, very seriously hampered.

COHEN: So, Indian's response to Russia's atrocities in Ukraine has been careful and calculated. On a call last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to Putin to end the violence, but at the U.N., India was one of 35 countries that abstained from a vote to condemn Russia for the invasion. Several nations are taking a similar approach to Russia, balancing pressure from the West and their own political and economic interests, remaining neutral enough to keep trading with both sides.

China is buying up more Russian oil and is vowed to keep their normal trade relationship. Complicating that, the Kremlin's asked China for military and economic support according to U.S. officials.

JAKE SULLIVAN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: This is something we're monitoring closely.

COHEN: Brazil voted to condemn Russia at the U.N. but still plans to buy Russian fertilizer, which makes up about 20 percent of their imported supply, as their massive agriculture industry faces a shortage. But the key export facing Putin's economy is energy and a huge portion still goes to Europe.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That is providing a sufficient lifeline for the Russian economy to keep it afloat.

COHEN: Countries like Germany, France and Italy have pushed back against calls to cut off that supply immediately, though the E.U. says it will slash gas imports by 66 percent this year.

OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): To do that from one day to the next would mean plunging our country and the whole of Europe into recession.

COHEN: The U.S. could sanction nations for doing business with Russia. In India's case, the White House says they haven't crossed the line, though it's unclear where that line actually is.

JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The rest of the world is watching where you're going to stand as it relates to this conflict.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

COHEN (on camera): Now, Erin, some experts think, as this war escalates, it will get harder for countries to stay neutral. And yet, there was a U.N. vote today to call for Russia to stop its invasion, 38 countries abstained, they stayed neutral. In that vote a month ago to condemn Russia, only 35 countries abstained.

So, based on that, it doesn't like more countries are necessarily heeding pressure to pick a side.

BURNETT: The really important point. Thank you so much, Gabe.

So, on the back on that report, I want to bring in Luisa Kroll, the executive editor of "Forbes".

So, Luisa, the economy has been battered, right? But, obviously, if the single biggest part of your economy is energy, which it is and people are still buying it, those people -- those countries are funding your war. And it's not just China. It's U.S. ally India, openly signing deals, it's the EU. It's core countries of NATO.

It's Germany. It's France. It's Italy, buying Russian energy, therefore funding the war and weapons that are used in Ukraine and could be used, of course, against themselves.

It's pretty staggering.

LUISA KROLL, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, FORBES: Yeah, I mean this is why when Biden basically issued the sanctions against oil and gas, I mean it was very calculated. Europe wasn't going to go that way because they rely so heavily on Russia for oil and gas. You know, it's kind of one of those things, you're dammed if you do, you're damned if you don't.

So many of these countries are tied to Russia and right now, they're trying out to figure ways in the future to be less dependent.

[19:45:01]

But what do you do right now? They're in a very tough situation, and that's why you still see the money going back and forth.

BURNETT: Yeah, it is incredible. I get that it's tough. On the other hand, I'm thinking, gosh, you guys had eight years to come up with a solution here and you waited until they actually crossed over the line, and it's unbelievable.

KROLL: Exactly.

BURNETT: But, Luisa, from your reporting, I know you've been watching this, the French car maker Renault announced it suspended all work at the Moscow factory but did that after being hit with criticism because it actually said it was going to restart production this week for a few days, right, so closed it, kind of said, we're going to open a few days, got slammed, they're going to close it back down again. Do you think we're going to see more of this, other Western companies trying to --

KROLL: We are seeing.

BURNETT: Go ahead.

KROLL: Yeah, we're seeing a lot of that. I mean, there are over 400 companies that have pulled out entirely, but there are dozens and dozens that have kind of said let's wait and see, I mean, whether it's like Dunkin that still has franchises says they won't invest but can't do anything about it. Kimberly Clark, Procter and Gamble, a lot of them said we'll do things like still sell the infant formula, we're going still to sell diapers but won't sell candy. That's when they came out this week with Nestle saying we'll sell some stuff but won't sell Kit-Kats.

And the rationale is they're trying to help the middle class of Russia, but a lot of people think you got to cut that off as well because that means there's still money going in and helping prop up the economy that's going to be them used to fight the war. So, you know, it gets more complicated instead of less, I think, as time goes on.

BURNETT: All right, Luisa, thanks so much. I always appreciate talk you to you.

KROLL: Thanks, Erin.

BURNETT: And next, mother and son managed to escape Kharkiv but what they witnessed has had a profound effect on the five-year-old boy.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Show them how you play, she says. I'm shooting at a tank, he says.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BURNETT: Pus, the remarkable text messages from the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to Trump's chief of staff, pressuring him to overturn the election, and quote, do not concede.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[19:50:22]

BURNETT: The United States is prepared to welcome 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. That announcement came today from President Biden who plans to visit refugees in Poland tomorrow.

Miguel Marquez is OUTFRONT today in Bucharest, Romania, where refugees are trying to adapt to a hardened reality.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MARQUEZ (voice-over): Dance therapy for Ukrainian moms and their children in war.

How was the dancing, Yeagor (ph)?

YEAGOR: Awesome (ph).

(LAUGHTER)

MARQUEZ: You're a very good dancer.

Not exactly shy Yeagor, 5 1/2 years old, he and his mom Tetiana are from Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, suffering indiscriminate rocket attacks since the war started.

How are you doing? How is he doing?

I'm playing soldiers, he says. His mom adds -- yes, soldiers. He's always saying air raid.

If me and you were playing air raid, how would you play?

Show them how you play, she says. I'm shooting at a tank, he says, any tank I can hit.

How do you explain what's happening in Ukraine?

He saw everything, she says, and now he's repeating it. I think he'll play regular games when this is over, he calms down, games like cars and trains.

No. No, says Yeagor. It will be the same. I like it.

Yeagor, his mom and godmother are one of dozens of families being housed by Jesuit refugee service in the local children's cancer charity, Magic Association.

UNIDENTFIED FEMALE: The mothers, they can be tough when they're with their children, but when they come and speak to us privately, they break down.

MARQUEZ: You are a very good dancer.

SOPHIA: Thank you.

MARQUEZ: Ylena and Sophia Orlova, 7 years old, arrived days ago from Dnipro. Russian attacks have been pushing toward and hitting the strategic Dnipro region. The city's population, nearly a million.

Orlova and several of her relatives are refugees, but not everyone.

My son is 18 years old, she says. He has an injured leg but wasn't allowed to cross the border.

My son is in Ukraine. She can barely speak the words.

Today's dance class, a welcome distraction.

Today, this was a stress relief, she says. For two days, we didn't eat or sleep. We're grateful to relax.

The dance instructor, a refugee, too. He fled war in Cameroon.

I want them to feel joy, he said, because I know how it is to be in their places. It's very hard. It was very hard for me, too.

Sophia wanted to dance in Ukraine but was too young. Today, a bit of hope.

My dream, she says, came true.

The simple activity bringing comfort to moms and kids, refugees far from home.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

MARQUEZ: My God, to hear that young boy talk about playing war, bombing tanks, it was so critical. These are the most vulnerable of refugees. Places like Bucharest and the country of Romania and so many NGOs that pitched in, to try to start doing the long term stuff, housing, and education, medical care, all the stuff they're going to need in the months and years ahead -- Erin.

BURNETT: Miguel, thank you so much.

And next, the breaking news. We have obtained text messages that show the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas pushing Trump's chief of staff to overturn the 2020 election.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[19:57:47]

BURNETT: Breaking news: the January 6th Select Committee has obtained more than two dozen text messages between former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Ginni Thomas. She is the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.

These are incredible text messages because Thomas urges Meadows to push ahead with efforts to overturn the election incredibly explicitly. Take a look at this one. This is November 6th.

Thomas tells Meadows, quote: Do not concede. It takes time for the army who is gathering for his back.

It's unclear how Meadows or if Meadows responded to that particular message. We don't have his side of it. There's a lot more where this came from.

And Ryan Nobles is OUTFRONT on Capitol Hill breaking this story.

Ryan, this is amazing stuff. This is the very prominent, powerful wife of a Supreme Court justice texting the chief of staff in the White House. What else does Ginni Thomas say?

RYAN NOBLES, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's pretty clear, Erin, that she sided with those closest to Donald Trump who believed that he had actually won the election and that it was being stolen from him. She implored the then chief of staff Mark Meadows to do everything he possibly could to try to stand in the way of certification of Joe Biden's victory, including encouraging these questionable conservative lawyers that were spreading false claims of election fraud, like Sidney Powell.

This is an exchange between both Thomas and Meadows on November 19th. Ginny Thomas writes: Sounds like Sidney and her team are getting inundated with evidence of fraud. Make a plan. Release the Kraken and save us from the left taking American down.

Of course, the Kraken is how Sidney Powell described herself. And then, of course, there's January 6th itself, Erin. We know that Ginni Thomas was here in Washington on that day. She watched part of President Trump's speech at the ellipse and said she went home after the fact.

She reached out to Meadows on January 10th, just four days after the violence and chaos here on Capitol Hill and said, quote: We are living through what feels like the end of America. Most of us are disgusted with the VP and are in listening mode to see where to fight with our teams. Those who attacked the capitol are not represented of our great team of patriots for DJT. Amazing times, the end of liberty.

This is the wife of a Supreme Court justice suggesting that Mike Pence, the vice president, should have stood in the way of a certification of the election results. It is now part of the January 6th investigation -- Erin.

BURNETT: Incredible stuff though. Well, thank you very much, Ryan.

And thanks to all of you.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

JOHN VAUSE, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm John Vause in Lviv, Ukraine.

It is 10 a.m. here in Ukraine where Russian forces are reportedly stepping up their offensive in the last -- in the last eastern region of Donbas. Much of that area has been under the control of Russian- backed separatists, making it difficult to receive accurate information.

Governors in the region report fierce attack from the Russian aircraft, artillery, as well as mortar fire. To the north, the Kharkiv region is also a key target for the Russians. Authorities report a major fire after a gas pipeline was hit.

And shelling in the town of Izyum is described as constant. Meanwhile, Ukraine says Russian troops are no longer in control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant north of Kyiv. Site of the world's worst nuclear disaster fell to Russian troops during the early days of the invasion. And Ukraine's president is warning Russian forces are planning more attacks in Donbas, Kharkiv, and the southern port city of Mariupol.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): They said three or five days. They thought that this would be enough for them to seize our entire state, and it's already 36, and we are standing and we will continue to fight, until the end.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VAUSE: Ukrainian soldiers who so far have successfully defended the capital of Kyiv say it's their stronger morale and spirit, giving them the advantage over the Russians. But still, life in Kyiv is becoming increasingly difficult for those who remain facing acute shortages of essential supplies. We have more now from Christiane Amanpour.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN ANCHOR: The first thing you notice approaching the front northeast of Kyiv are the lines of villagers waiting for humanitarian handouts. They receive a bag of bread and basics to get them through these difficult days.

[22:25:05]

"The first week of the war a shell hit us near the greenhouse. We barely survived," says this woman. "We had help from strangers around us. They gave us bread and canned food. We wouldn't have managed otherwise."

No one here knows when this war will end or whether Russia still has designs on Kyiv. The frontline is about a mile away. For now, an uneasy calm prevails ever since the Ukrainian defenders stop the Russian advance here. It was February 28th, they say, day four of the war.

They want to show us how they did it. But first, we have to clamber over the bridge they downed to see the armored column they managed to take out. The riverbank is littered with their skeletons. This was a Turkey shoot, Russian armored vehicles and tanks had come off the road to avoid the anti-tank mines. Only to find themselves unable to cross the bridge and unable to reverse in time.

Ukrainian forces tell us none of the soldiers inside survived. A little further up the road, two tanks have been virtually smelted, blasted almost to smithereens. Forty-year-old Yevgeny (Ph), a veteran fighter proudly tells us, this was his handiwork. "We all here have one role, to keep the enemy off our land," he says.

"First thing they did after seeing the village, they started to shell houses just like that. They didn't see us. They didn't know we were here, so they just started to work on houses. And so, I took the tank in my sights and I fired a rocket. And goodbye to him."

The destroyed vehicles are stamped with an O, the Ukrainian officers here tell us this identifies them as Russian units that entered from Belarus to the north. Oleg is the officer who commanded this operation. "As for now, looking at previous fighting we've had, I can tell you that we are trained better," he tells me. We have stronger morale and spirit because we are at home. They are afraid, but they go because they're made to."

He's been battle hardened ever since the first Russian invasion in 2014. He says his side has enough weapons, ammunition, and determination to win. "I can tell you, I'm almost sure the Russians are regrouping and not retreating," he says. "Besides, we are preparing ourselves to go forward, we're not preparing just to defend here."

U.S. and British intelligence say Putin seems to have, quote, "massively misjudged the situation. And clearly, overestimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory."

And this old lady tells us, "I have seen one war and here we go again. I wish Putin would go away."

The people of this land remain stalwart and the soldiers remain dug in. Hoping they can continue to withstand whatever Putin has in store for them next.

[03:05:05]

Christian Amanpour, CNN, East of Kyiv.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

VAUSE: Earlier I spoke with Daniel Davis, a retired U.S. army lieutenant colonel who has 21 years of active service. I asked him if this now war over Donbas, a war these two sides have been fighting for eight years, what does that mean in terms of a timeline, does it now just drag out this conflict for months, or even longer?

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DANIEL DAVIS, SENIOR FELLOW & MILITARY EXPERT, DEFENSE PRIORITIES: It's important to understand what the Russian objective is, it's not the territorial capture of the area, it is the destruction of a large formation of Ukrainian armed forces. That's what their objective has been for a long time, that's why they haven't really attacked any cities other than Kherson and Mariupol.

Because those are directly tied with the attempt to surround about a 40,000-member battle force that the Ukrainians opposite to the Donbas. Right now, Russia is trying to blank the Ukrainians on the north and on the south, if they penetrate either one of those, it's possible for them to capture the entire battle force, and that would be a devastating, and possibly lethal blow to the Ukrainians. So, everything depends on Ukraine holding that line.

VAUSE: Russian forces appear to have abandoned the Chernobyl nuclear power plant as well, does that fit in with his focus on the Donbas? Or it is more likely that withdrawal --

(CROSSTALK)

DAVIS: It does.

VAUSE: -- were maybe the result of troops just being sickened by radiation?

DAVIS: I mean, I wouldn't have any way to know whether that was the case, but I do know that militarily, it has -- it has no power and it has no importance to them. So, you know, it's not like they are needing to hold that for anything else. And I think that Ukraine would have to go through several lines of Russians to get there.

What they need though, is to focus on what's going on in the Donbas. Because I think they recognize that everything depends on that. And I think you are going to see them throwing the kitchen sink on this. And it looks like so as President Zelenskyy.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

VAUSE: Well, joining me now for more is Carl Bildt, the former prime minister of Sweden. Mr. Bildt, thank you for being with us.

You have publicly said that Putin cannot win this war, but for now he seems to be raising the stakes almost at every turn, he is threatening to shut down gas supplies to Europe today unless they pay in rubles. So, the question is when does he come to the same conclusion that you and many others have?

CARL BILDT, FORMER SWEDISH PRIME MINISTER: I think that's quite some time down the road, I have to fear. I don't think he can win this war. I can see a number of scenarios in which he loses, but he knows that losing means losing big time. Adm for him, that's not an option.

He has said very, very far-reaching objectives for this particular military operation. If you listen to the different speeches, lengthy speeches that he's made, he's made it abundantly clear. He is not going to cave in. He is going to rather escalate until in some sort of way at some point in time he really loses.

VAUSE: You recently tweeted this, I don't think that the problem has been Putin's been misled by advisers, I think he has been misled by himself. That's quite a statement.

BILDT: Yes.

VAUSE: Are you saying that the Russian president is essentially delusional right now?

BILDT: Well, call it delusional if you want to, he has convinced himself of a particular version of Russian history. He has been diving deep down in obscure sources of Russian history. And if you listen to him, or he had listened to his speeches and his activities during the last few, not only months but years, he has been far more interested in the past Russia than the future Russia.

And he thinks that his Russia is in retreat, it has to go on defensive, it has to beat back the absolutely lethal challenge that a democratic Ukraine represents. That's the version of history and the version of this campaign that he has presented in a number of lengthy ramblings, far-reaching speeches. And that is a delusion that he has created to himself and I think he is a prisoner of that particular, call it delusion, and bringing Russia down with him, by the way.

VAUSE: Well, after the Ukrainian president spoke to lawmakers in Brussels, the Belgium prime minister bluntly rejected the idea of a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying it would escalate this conflict. We've heard that before, but then he added this, listen to this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ALEXANDER DE CROO, BELGIAN PRIME MINISTER: NATO is not a party in this conflict. And it should not become one. And I realize this is not the answer that you want to hear. But I believe that you understand the argument. Still, this is a time for us to take sides. That is what Belgium has done, and that is what we will continue to do. We will continue to support Ukraine.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

[03:09:55]

VAUSE: Can you explain why he is actually saying, because on the surface at least, it seems he is contradicting himself multiple times in a very short statement.

BILDT: Well, it's certainly a matter of definition. From the Russian pointedly, I think they are at war with us. What we have done, I don't know about Belgium, but I assume Belgium as well, but Sweden certainly, and Finland where I'm sitting at the moment, we have supplied the Ukrainian army with quite a lot of weapons and we continue to do that. Weapons and ammunition, and financial support.

From that point of view, we are of course part of this particular conflict. And we have made it abundantly clear that we have a stake in it. If Putin were to succeed with the designs that he has set out, it would be of course lethal to Ukraine. Needless to say. And to millions of people there. But it would be a profound danger to other nations and to the entire structure of the European Atlantic securities.

So, we are part of this particular conflict, and we don't have our army units and we'll not have our units, army unites fighting in Ukraine, but we are supplying the Ukrainian armed forces with everything that we conceivably can.

VAUSE: One country which has yet to choose a side I guess in this conflict is India. The Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov he is beginning talks there at this hour. How crucial is it for the United States and NATO to get India on its side, essentially as a counter way, if you like, to China?

BILDT: I think it's primarily of interest to India itself that it sorts this out. They have a long-standing relationship. It goes back to the Soviet days. They are dependent upon the Russians for the supply of a lot of their armed equipment for their defense forces.

But India adheres to the rules of the international order. And what the Russians have done here is a crime against the very most fundamental principle of international order. That is, you are not supposed to invade other countries. It's a crime of aggression. And I find it surprising to put it mildly that the Indians can be neutral against a crime of aggression.

I mean, if China attacks and tries to conquer parts of India, which might very well happen, does India expect us to abstain in a vote of the United Nations? India expects us to stand on their side. And that I would certainly favor. But why then does India refused to condemn the Russian invasion and aggression? That's somewhat of a mystery to me. VAUSE: The Polish prime minister has spoken about the impact that international sanctions have had on Russia and how Putin has minimized their impact. Here he is. Listen to this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI, POLISH PRIME MINISTER: For the time being, Putin and his people, they were able to change their fiscal policy, monetary policy, financial policy in such a way that they are immune to the sanctions to some extent at least for the foreseeable future, for the next several months.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VAUSE: So, do you agree with that assessment, that essentially Putin is immune from the sanctions, and does that mean that the U.S. should rethink their strategy?

BILDT: No, but I think we have to recognize that sanctions is a measure that works primarily in the medium and long term. It has an immediate impact when it's introduced. And there was a financial shock to the Russian system, they managed those particular effect short term. But I mean, the major sanctions are going to be their long term because they are going to severely inhibit the possibility to develop the Russian economy.

If you take just one example, I mean, Putin and Russia, it's very dependent upon the huge oil and gas products up in the Arctic. It's very difficult to see that they can proceed. Denied all of the western technologies, in the way that they would be enough.

So, the sanction effect is substantial but primarily medium and long term in its effect. The short-term effect of our aid is primarily what we can do in order to get weapons and defense equipment and financial support to the Ukrainian state.

VAUSE: Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, thank you so much. We appreciate your insight, sir, and your experience. Thank you for being with us.

BILDT: Thank you.

VAUSE: Well, four million Ukrainians have been made refugees by Putin's war of choice, leaving all they know and all they own behind. But trauma though made a little easier by volunteers who endured similar trauma themselves. That story coming up.

[03:15:00]

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

VAUSE: Russia is expected to open a humanitarian corridor out of the hard-hit city of Mariupol today. Mariupol's mayor says 90 percent of the city's buildings have either been damaged or destroyed. Russia agreed to open the corridor after a request from the leaders of France and Germany. A convoy of buses on their way right now to Mariupol to pick up refugees but there is no word if they have arrived. But this convoy cannot arrive soon enough. Ukraine's president says that Russia is prioritizing military options in the Donbas region.

Many Ukrainians who have fled their homes have headed to Poland, but Hungary has also taken in more than 300,000 refugees as well.

As CNN's Matt Rivers reports that some of them are now learning to adapt to a new life which was unexpected and came suddenly.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: In the play area of a temporary refugee shelter in Zahony, Hungary, kids sketch out their recent traumas on paper. Burning tanks, drawn on crayon, deadly battles fill out the chalkboard.

[03:20:02]

Just outside that tent, Anmol Gupta can't erase their pain, but he can get one of those kids a stuffed animal, and a smile in the process.

When someone says I'm scared, what do you say to them?

ANMOL GUPTA, INDIAN CITIZEN WHO FLED UKRAINE: Then we tell them what's going to happen next and everything will be OK, so we don't have to worry. Then I start talking with them. So.

RIVERS: Yes. You are good at that.

GUPTA: Yes. Yes. That I know.

RIVERS: A smile he says, goes a long. Anmol is a volunteer having spent the last month just across the Ukraine border helping weary Ukrainians navigate the first few steps of new lives as refugees in Hungary.

The native of northern India is fluent in Russia. A skill honed over his years studying for a medical degree in the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine. He was living there when the bombs first started falling. His apartment was destroyed, his motorcycle hit by bullets and shrapnel, and his nights spent in bombshell.

He fled to Hungary but still, he wanted to help. As a foreigner, he says he lost very little while his friends, Ukrainians, have lost everything.

Is that part of the motivation that you had for being here?

GUPTA: Yes. It can be. It can be. Because I have been with them for nine years and it feels like they are also my family.

RIVERS: And he is not the only foreigner once living in Ukraine that still wants to help. Behind kiosk restaurants fancy dining room in Budapest, works a man who just two weeks ago was fleeing from explosions.

Steven Ezeudo works in the kitchen, but in early March he was in Kharkiv. He fled when the Russians attacked.

So, were you scared?

STEVEN EZEUDO, REFUGEE/RESTAURANT WORKER: Yes, I was so scared. So scared. Because when the bombing start it was shaking our building.

RIVERS: He was studying there for a degree in business administration and wants to go back. But for now, he and his colleagues spend a part of their day cooking free meals for refugees.

EZEUDO: At least I'm helping. So, I can give some people food, you know. Some people that don't have anything to eat.

RIVERS: Back at the border, hundreds of refugees are headed in Budapest direction. Anmol picks up some tickets, hands them out, then picks up some bags, and walks people to the train. He has done this every single day for a month now. So, from us, a question.

How long do you think you are going to stay here?

GUPTA: As long as needed.

RIVERS: As long as needed? And when will that be?

GUPTA: No idea. That's the thing. I have no idea. But I believe that there will be some point then people will stop coming.

RIVERS: But that time hasn't yet come. And so, he keeps helping amidst a crowd of people who need it. It's right where he wants to be.

Matt Rivers, CNN, on the Hungary/ Ukraine border.

VAUSE: You too can help the people of Ukraine. They are in need of so much, shelter, food, essential supplies. Please go to cnn.com/impact, and there you will find a number of ways that you can help, and you can show that whatever you give gets to the people who needed the most.

Well, another fuel depot up in flames, but this time it's on Russian soil. Local officials blame Ukraine. The very latest when we come back.

[03:25:00]

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

VAUSE: Welcome back, everyone. I'm John Vause, reporting live from Lviv in Ukraine.

A large fuel depot in the Russian city of Belgorod has been attacked and it's engulfed in flames. Local officials claim it was fired on early this morning by two Ukrainian helicopters flying in at low altitude. CNN cannot confirm that claim.

Belgorod is just across the border from the besieged Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.

Elsewhere, the U.S. says the Russian military fire now appears to be concentrated on four areas in Ukraine, including the capital. According to a senior U.S. defense official, Russian air attacks have stepped up significantly over the past 24 hours.

Ukraine's president says Russian forces appear to be shifting their focus now to the Donbas region. And U.K.'s military intelligence says that Moscow is bringing in reinforcements from Georgia. Here's more now from President Zelenskyy.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ZELENSKYY (through translator): The situation in the southern direction and in the Donbas remains extremely difficult. Russian troops are accumulating the potential for strikes, powerful blows.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VAUSE: Well, more than six million Ukrainians have now been internally displaced here because of this war. A short time ago, I spoke with Ukrainian filmmaker Iryna Tsilyk who fled Kyiv and with her child for the relevant safety here in Lviv. I ask her how she is coping with her life, which is now been so dramatically upended. Here she is.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

IRYNA TSILYK, UKRAINIAN FILMMAKER & WRITER: This is Russia's war against Ukraine, it's been going on for eight years.

VAUSE: Yes.

TSILYK: So, we've got used to everything, and I was focused on this war during all these years but had never expected that this Russian full-scale invasion could come to my city, too. So, this month it was probably the longest month of my life. And I went through all five stages of grief. At the moment, I accept it.

VAUSE: Yes.

TSILYK: That we are at war.

[03:29:59]

VAUSE: Yes. And you said, I think I read something that you said, it's a bit like a movie. And you are a filmmaker. So, you think it's kind of -- you feel like it's a bit like a movie around you. Almost surreal, I guess?

TSILYK: Yes, but that is our reality --

VAUSE: Yes.

TSILYK: -- and we should face it, and we should resist. You know, all people that I know, most of them are artists, filmmakers, writers. They defend Ukraine on different fields. Right now, some people defend Ukraine with weapons in their hands and others use other tools and weapons like cultural diplomacy or in fulfilled.

VAUSE: There are a lot of people who are opposed to war who don't want to fight here in Ukraine and they are forced to. It's against sort of their nature, but they have no other choice. They are sort of being forced into fighting a war, which is Putin's choice. How does that change people's character?

TSILYK: That is true. I think that Ukrainians they did not want to fight. But what can we do, because if the enemy comes to your home, to your country, you should defend it? For example, my husband, he is a writer, he's author of 10 novels, come on, he is not a military type of people.

VAUSE: But he is (Inaudible) now.

TSILYK: Yes. He used to serve in the Ukrainian armed forces before in 2015, and he needs to do it now. So.

VAUSE: It's just what you have to do? Tell me what was your journey like when you left Kyiv and you managed to finally get here to Lviv. What, three days or something?

TSILYK: I didn't really want to flee from my city because Kyiv is my place of power, right? I'm also the mother, and I'm responsible for our child. So, I had to go to safe. But at the same time, no one knows what is the safe place in Ukraine now.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VAUSE: Yryna Tsilyk there, Ukrainian filmmaker and writer. Well, right now, diplomacy is picking up momentum focusing on two countries which have refused to join international condemnation of the Kremlin. India is hosting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Talks have now just started.

These images coming in from New Delhi just a few moments ago.

Meantime, China leaders are likely to face blow back from the E.U. which were during a virtual summit set to begin at the top of the hour.

CNN correspondents are closely following both of these meetings. Kristie Lu Stout is live for us this hour in Hong Kong, where Vedika Sud is standing by in New Delhi. But first, let's start with Kristie.

And this virtual meeting, I guess the question is, how much pressure can the E.U. actually put on China, who needs more, who needs the other the most?

KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, China does rely heavily on trade with the European Union and its ally the United States much more so than Russia, so that is a potential point of leverage going into these talks which will be tense.

You know, this comes amid very rocky relations between the E.U. and China, this high-level virtual summit between these two powers and it's beginning at the top of the hour with a working session first, with the Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, and then four hours later another working session, that with the Chinese President Xi Jinping.

On the agenda, you have health, you have human rights, trade, climate change, but E.U. officials they want the focus to be on the war in Ukraine. And namely China's relationship with Russia after the invasion. In fact, in the run up to today's high-level virtual summit, a top E.U. official accused China of giving political support to Russia and its assault on Ukraine.

I want to bring up this statement for you, it's a very strong one, this coming from the head of the European parliament delegation of relations with China, saying the "veil is threadbare, it fools no one. He adds, the way in which China handles this conflict will have bearing on the future overall E.U./ China relationship." Unquote.

A breakthrough is widely not expected to take place as a result of today's summit. Especially as China and Russia reaffirm and doubled down on their pre-war relationship. That was made clear earlier this week.

The Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov had a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi in Tunxi, that's in China's Anhui Province. And Wang Yi gave no indication that China was willing to condemn Russia for its assault on Ukraine.

In fact, there was a very different message that was delivered through the ministry of foreign affairs after day one of that foreign minister meeting. In which we heard from the foreign ministry spokesperson, saying that there is no ceiling, in fact, we'll bring it up for you. He said there is no ceiling for China/Russia cooperation, no ceiling for us to strive for peace, no ceiling for us to safeguard security and no ceiling for us to compose hegemony.

So, the message is clear here. After the invasion, China declaring no ceiling in its relationship with Russia. Before the invasion, at that very high-profile summit before the Beijing Winter Olympic Games between Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping when they declared their relationship had no limits. John?

VAUSE: Kristie Lu stout there covering all the basis as always. Thank you for that.

[03:34:58]

Let's go live now to Vedika Sud standing by in New Delhi. That meeting with Lavrov and his counterparts there in New Delhi just getting started. What are we expecting from that?

VEDIKA SUD, CNN PRODUCER: Yes, that meeting is underway. We have visuals of Lavrov meeting with his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India's foreign minister. This is going to be a meeting like I've said before, where all eyes will be on really comes out of it.

Lavrov is also meeting with the Indian prime minister later today. And we are being told by an Indian senior government official who is privy to the preparation for talks between the prime minister and Lavrov. That the Indian prime minister will once again reiterate the need for cessation of violence and hostility between Russia and Ukraine.

Now, you've mentioned this, John, but I'm just going to mention it again out here, India has taken a very neutral stance, it has far from condemned Russia's aggression at key international ports, the UNSC, as well as the UNG. Now there are several reasons for this. One of them being that Russia and India share very special ties, like the two of them have put it in the past. This was evident when Putin came visiting, it was just about a 24-hour visit or less last December.

And if you remember, he barely moved out of Russia due to the pandemic last year. And that once again, reindorsed the relationship shared between Modi and Putin. Now also India heavily depends on Russia for major arms and other defense equipment. Over 50 percent of India's defense equipment comes from Russia.

Also, India is worried about the fact that if they don't have this neutral stand, there could be closer ties between Russia and China in the near future. And China is seen as India's top adversary. We share a border with China.

Now, speaking to national news channel in India, Ukraine's foreign minister has said that he does welcome any kind of intervention by Prime Minister and his government for talks with Russia. Let's listen in.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DMYTRO KULEBA, UKRAINIAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: India has its own relationship with Russia, and if they can help, if they can help us to stop this war, which go against the interest of everyone, it's even not in the interest of the people of Russia.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

SUD: A string of leaders have been visiting India ever since the war broke out. And we've seen the Japanese prime minister speak with Narendra Modi. We have seen the U.K. foreign secretary who was here while Lavrov landed in India along with the U.S. national deputy -- national security adviser, deputy security adviser from the U.S. also visiting.

So, there are a lot of these leaders and top officials who are trying to make their case with India, but India has maintained its stand, it wants to remain non-aligned as long as possible. The pressure is building diplomatically, but India has been very clear on their stand. Let's just see what really comes of this visit with Lavrov and when he meets with the prime minister, we are waiting for more. There is also talk of a possible deal that the two can strike when it comes to oil imports from Russia. As of now, India's imports are less than 1 percent from Russia. And while talking with Liz Truss, U.K. foreign secretary, the foreign minister of India also made a point. He said India has less than 1 percent export from Russia, whereas Europe has ramped up its imports from Russia as far as crude oil is concerned by 15 percent. John?

VAUSE: Vedika, a very busy day for you, at least a busy couple hour ahead. Thank you for that live report.

That's all for me this morning from Lviv. My colleague Kim Brunhuber picks up after a very short break.

And when he comes back, a standoff over gas between Russia and Europe, how the E.U. is responding to Moscow's demands for payment in rubles. We will have that and a whole lot more in just a moment.

[03:40:00]

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN ANCHOR: The International Energy Agency is planning to hold an emergency meeting in the coming hours after the U.S. president announced a record release of 180 million barrels of oil from America's Strategic Reserves.

The agency says it plans to discuss what steps to take to provide stability to oil markets as America's move sets the stage for other nations to release oil as well. Here is Joe Biden's reasons for this historic move.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: This is a wartime bridge to increase oil supply and until production ramps up later this year. And it is by far the largest release of our -- of our national reserve in our history. And it will provide a historic amount of supply, for a historic amount of time. A six-month bridge to the fall.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BRUNHUBER: All right, now let's take a look at the oil market looked like in the wake of Biden's announcement. Brent crude down over 5 percent, about $105 a barrel. In the last two months, here have been the big swings from under 100 to $130 and back.

CNN's Nina dos Santos joins us now from London. So, Nina, Europe facing Russian threats of shutting off gas, the possibility of energy rationing, what's the latest?

NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the latest is its increasingly alarming talks that has caught European bureaucrats on the back foot here, Kim, after the Russian President Vladimir Putin just yesterday in a surprise move signed into law this presidential decree that essentially declared that so-called unfriendly countries.

[03:45:05]

That means countries have sanctioned Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, would have to now start paying for their national gas that they're getting from Russia in rubles and not in the currency that those countries had originally stipulated, as per the contract so they would be paying for this gas in.

And this is prompted also some concerns about a supply shock to Europe, which is increasingly been hugely reliant on Russian national gas. It gets about 40 to 45 percent of its energy needs from Russia.

Now, President Vladimir Putin appeared in a conference, press conference as he was signing into law this decree to acknowledge that this would strain the ties between Russia and its largest customer for gas. But at the same time, you've got to remember his country is also desperate for foreign exchange reserves after a number of the central bank foreign reserves as well are frozen, thanks to international sanctions and.

And he also has to appear to be doing something to push back against that international pressure from sanctions. Here's what he had to say.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The western countries have taken their measures and we have responded. I suggest we assume there will not be the same cooperation as we've had in the past with our former partners. We won't shut anyone out, and we won't be a closed off country, but we have to consider the reality.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

DOS SANTOS: So, what exactly is Russia proposing here? Well, it's proposing what some people are saying might be something of a compromise. Meaning that as of today, European countries would in theory have to start paying for their natural gas they get from Russia, their biggest supplier, by paying it into a specifically designated account at Gazprom Bank, perhaps in their own currency and then it would be converted into rubles, thereby giving Russia the opportunity of that hard cash from abroad that it so desperately needs.

But this creates a wedge between the United States and the U.K. and the E.U., because the U.S. and the U.K. have sanctioned Gazprom Bank while the E.U. hasn't. Now everybody is looking to big countries like Germany, they get about 55 percent of their gas needs from Russia to find out how exactly they are going to be dealing with this situation.

At an E.U. level as a whole, the German chancellor has been saying just like the president of France, that the E.U. will not be blackmailed over this. But Germany, Kim, has now started to have to move to the first phase of energy rationing, Kim?

BRUNHUBER: All right. Thank you so much, Nina dos Santos. I appreciate it.

Well, many are celebrating in Italy where the government is starting to phase out some COVID restrictions. We'll go live to Rome with how life is changing coming up after the break. Stay with us.

[03:50:00]

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BRUNHUBER: All right. We've got new developments on the COVID lockdown in Shanghai. Western parts of the city are now under lockdown. It will last until April 5th. The residents aren't allowed to leave their homes.

Meanwhile, parts of eastern Shanghai are still under lockdown for up to nine more days. Official plan on lifting that lockdown earlier on Friday but a surge of infections changes those plans. And in an addition, the city has announced that you have to have a negative COVID test to leave Shanghai. The aim is to keep the virus from spreading to nearby towns.

Well after more than two years, Italy's coronavirus state of an emergency has finally expired. And come May, Italians will be able to enjoy many more activities without having to show proof of vaccination.

I want to bring in CNN contributor Barbie Nadeau. So, that will be a huge relief for Italians. What's the mood there?

BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, the mood is quite high here. You know, you look at especially the Easter season. Such an important holiday here in Italy, not just for the religious aspect, because for the tourism aspect as well. That's usually been traditionally when tourism starts here. Kicks off the season.

And you know, two years ago, Easter was canceled, a year ago it was heavily restricted. This year people will be able to do what they want and how they want. Italians are really excited about that. They've given a lot, there been a lot of sacrifices economically with their friends, with families so many deaths here.

Nearly 160,000 in this country over the course of the last two years, and people are really excited about putting this behind them, Kim.

BRUNHUBER: Right. But Barbie, then if the COVID numbers to get markedly worse, what happens then? I understand that they won't be able to just snap back to those old restrictions.

NADEAU: That's right. You know, the big, -- the biggest aspect of the lifting of the state of emergency is the fact that the government can no longer just automatically institute a new restriction. They can't order a lock down tomorrow, or new mask mandate or curfew, or anything like that. They will have to go through parliament to do that.

If the numbers continue to rise, they would have to reinstate a state of emergency. But nobody sees that in the future. Because this country is heavily vaccinated, and people are very, very careful and very -- even though as of May 1st you won't have to wear masks indoors, the latest surveys show that most Italians are going to carry their masks with them anyway. If they're in a crowded place they'll just put them on.

So, there's a lot of compliance here. Italians are very, very health conscious and they're very, very concerned about going back to where they were. So, everybody is looking forward to going ahead, but the government won't be able to make any moves without parliament from this point forward.

BRUNHUBER: Yes, interesting. Yes. And then, so looking at the rest of Europe, then there is more concern over the growing numbers in many countries. What's the latest there?

NADEAU: Well, you know, we've seen all across Europe the restrictions slowly, slowly being phased out. Italy had some of the, you know, the most strict restrictions. And they are sort of the last ones to be lifting them.

[03:55:04]

But I think you're going to see just people really taking care to make sure that they do get tested, that if they don't feel well, they stay inside. Right now, we don't have quarantines and things like that as of April 1st that people have to worry about unless they actually test positive for COVID.

But across Europe people will not forget how bad these last two years have been. So, despite these restrictions being lifted, I think everyone is still going to be quite careful, Kim.

BRUNHUBER: All right. Thanks so much, Barbie Nadeau in Rome.

Well, I'm Kim Brunhuber at CNN Center in Atlanta. I'll be back with more news in just a moment. Please do stay with us.

Misinformation on Facebook in the US received six times more likes, shares and interactions during the 2020 presidential election than factual news from conventional publishers, according to a Washington Post report last September of a peer-reviewed university study.

The study suggests that on the far left and far right, social media algorithms reward publishers who offer more extreme news.

This is hardly a surprise given US mainstream media piled on newspaper circulation with the hoax Russiagate story for four years. The Post last November apologised for – and withdrew from its website – parts of its Russiagate reporting that depended on the discredited Christopher Steele document about Trump and Moscow prostitutes.

Here, the Communications Minister Paul Fletcher last month promised to give the Australian Communications and Media Authority more power to police disinformation on platforms such as Facebook, Google, Twitter and YouTube.

No one wants legitimate debate and free speech curtailed, but too much disinformation is being spread online, often by malicious state actors or conspiracy theorists. And yet the very term disinformation can be highly political.

A spokesman for the minister last week said the reforms would apply only to online misinformation which is defined as “false, misleading or deceptive information that can cause harm”. He cited as examples “made up news items, doctored images and videos, false information shared on social media and scam advertisements”.

Some conservatives are sceptical of big-tech censorship they see as politically motivated, especially after President Trump was booted off Twitter on January 8, 2021. Worse was the pre-election decision to censor the Hunter Biden laptop story from the New York Post even though the Post had verified emails on the computer left at a Delaware repair shop.

Much of the research used by ACMA in its 2021 research paper released last month to justify Fletcher’s new reforms is based on surveys suggesting Australians have been exposed to pandemic misinformation.

A group of student protesters have been condemned after they attempted to interrup a panel discussion on free speech and civil liberties being held at Yale University.

Yet what constitutes Covid misinformation has changed over the past two years.

Andrew Bolt, never a Covid or vaccination sceptic, on Sky News and in the News Corp tabloids criticised Dan Andrews’ Victorian government in 2020 for banning golf and fishing. We now know people are at very little risk of catching Covid if socially distanced outdoors.

Similarly, Chris Kenny disputed vaccine mandates on the basis vaccination was to protect the vaccinated rather than stop the spread of Covid. We now know vaccines do offer protection against severe infection but probably do much less to prevent the spread of Covid than supporters of vaccine mandates first thought.

In hindsight, more in the media should have criticised state Covid responses.

The September 2020 arrest of pregnant Ballarat woman Zoe Buhler, then 28, for proposing an event on Facebook now looks ridiculous. She called for an anti-lockdown protest in regional Victoria in support of Melburnians stuck in stage four lockdowns. She was treated in much of the media as an extremist and still faces a three-day hearing set down for late August for breaching health orders.

That year, free speech really depended on your politics. Buhler did not march anywhere but on June 6 tens of thousands of Melbourne protesters broke lockdown rules to join the city’s Black Lives Matter march. Victoria Police fined the rally’s three organisers $1652 each for breaching public health orders but that was it.

Fletcher’s proposed ACMA changes are yet to be drafted. It is unclear if in cases similar to that of Buhler or the BLM rally, Facebook would face sanction for hosting posts supporting action contrary to health orders.

Many journalists criticised this paper’s Washington correspondent Adam Creighton for writing favourably about Sweden’s response to Covid. Two years into the pandemic Creighton’s work looks correct. Anti-lockdown Sweden has remained open and has recorded 1770 deaths per million of population. Italy, Spain and the UK have recorded 2640, 2189 and 2411 deaths per million respectively.

Could a future government crack down on free discussion of climate change, for example?

As with recent floods in South East Queensland and NSW, there is a powerful narrative in the left media trying to pin all floods and fires on climate change, even though the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has for many years made it clear that no single weather or fire event can be directly linked to climate change.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk says he is giving “serious thought” to building a new social media platform that will prioritise free speech and to ensure the fundamentals of democracy aren’t undermined.

Some climate campaigners have publicly called for legislation to crack down on what mainstream media publishes. Commenters here often deride this column for correctly stating there will be no net benefit to the planet if emissions in China, India and Russia grow at a faster rate than they fall in the West.

ABC Media Watch bagged News Corp during the 2019-20 fires for saying, quite correctly, that these were not the nation’s worst fires. Several fires have destroyed more bush and in my lifetime the death toll of 34 in the 2019-20 blazes has been exceeded by the 2009 Victorian Black Saturday fires (173), the 1983 South Australian and Victorian Ash Wednesday fires (75) and the 1967 Tasmanian Black Tuesday fires (62).

Media Watch also bagged News for coverage of this year’s floods. A 2014 study in the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Journal looks at 253 flood events from 1860 to 2012, many with more catastrophic effects and higher death tolls than this year’s floods.

In the 1953-56 extended east coast La Nina event, 66 people died from the Gold Coast to Kempsey in eight flood events. Populations in the region were much lower than today.

How about the free exchange of ideas on race? This column has argued Guardian Australia’s Aboriginal Deaths in Custody project is based on a false analysis of the problem. Some leading Aboriginal thinkers have criticised a project that does not acknowledge Aboriginal people are under-represented in deaths in custody, although over-represented in jail. This is what the 1991 Deaths in Custody Royal Commission report actually found.

Yet ACMA seems unlikely to challenge social media posts based on the Guardian’s misreporting.

Mainstream ideas often reflect fashion rather than fact.

The example of African American economist Thomas Sowell is a standout. Sowell is largely cancelled by US universities and is not acknowledged in Washington’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. Yet playwright David Mamet has described Sowell as “our greatest contemporary philosopher”.

A couple of quotes might tell readers why Sowell has been cancelled.

“I have never understood why it is greed to want to keep the money you have earned but not greed to take someone else’s money.” And on advocates for change: “Much of the social history of the Western world, over the past three decades, has been a history of replacing what worked with what sounded good.”

While those sentiments would be anathema to most media regulators this column has encountered, it would be good to know sensible people could remain free to utter them, even online.

US slaps sanctions on 120 more Russian, Belarusian companies

WASHINGTON/ROME/WARSAW/ANKARA/TBILISI/TOKYO/BERLIN/BAKU/BEIJING, Apr 4 (PRIME) -- The U.S. Department of Commerce has expanded the anti-Russian and anti-Belarusian sanctions by putting 120 more companies from the two countries on its blacklist, the authority said in a statement late on April 1.

The list includes Russia’s Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute, subsidiaries of Tactical Missiles Corporation, state defense companies Svyaz and Salut, research association Mars, as well as Belarusian tractor and military truck producer MZKT, state-controlled entities from Gomel, Belarusian State Security Committee’s elite group Alpha, and others.

SANCTION TALKS, BOOMERANG IMPACT

The E.U. has no plans to slap sanctions on the Russian energy industry, European Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni told reporters on April 2.

“We are working on further packages of sanctions. To be clear, they do not include the energy sector as of now. We are working on an attempt to restrict the opportunities for bypassing the sanctions right now,” he said.

But Piotr Muller, press secretary of the Polish government, said that Poland had suggested a new list of the anti-Russian sanctions to the European Commission, and wants the union to implement previous promises to stop financial flows to and from Russia.

The second point of the proposals is termination of supplies of the Russian oil, gas and coal to the E.U., or at least outlining prospects of when it could happen clearly. The third point is complete confiscation of Russian oligarchs’ property in the E.U. instead of its current freeze, Muller said.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on his Twitter page that the current Western sanctions are a flop as the ruble is returning to where it was before the special operation in Ukraine, which means that the sanctions failed to produce the expected impact.

Turkey will not join the anti-Russian sanctions, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said in an interview to TRT Haber television channel broadcast on April 1.

“We have already stated our position that we will not join the sanctions. We used the right that the Montreux Convention gives us, and military vessels are not allowed to the (Bosporus and Dardanelles) straits. Warships are kept away from the military operation, this is our positions, and all the parties understand it,” he said.

Europe’s dependency on Russian natural gas will remain relevant for the next 10 years, he added.

Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili said that his country would not impose economic sanctions on Russia because it would contradict national interests.

Japanese Economy, Trade, and Industry Minister Koichi Hagiuda said that the only way for the world to act is to toughen sanctions on Russia, but they will obviously have a negative impact on the other economies, including Japan. The world powers should start thinking about softening  anti-Russian sanctions only when peace in the region becomes obvious.

German Finance Minister Christian Lindner also said that the situation in Ukraine would lead to the wealth of Germans falling. The country will have to pay more for the energy sources, and it will be unable to prevent the wealth of citizens from falling, and the support measures for troubled companies will be only temporary, he said.

Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said that the sanctions hurt the energy spheres of all European countries. Italy wants to break free from the energy dependency on Russia, and Azerbaijan is one of the priority partners in that, he said.

Cecilia Rose, representative of U.S. President Joe Biden’s council of economic advisors, said in an interview to CNBC that the White House was concerned with the possibility of drastic worsening of food supplies in several regions of the world due to the situation in Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine were the “bread basket” for many countries of the world as they cultivated wheat, soy, and other crops, she said.

China is no side of the Russian–Ukrainian conflict, and Beijing does not want its trade relations with all countries, including Russia, hurt by the sanctions, Wang Lutong, director-general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s European Affairs Department, said in a news briefing on April 2.

“We will not do anything on purpose to bypass the sanctions that U.S. and the E.U. imposed on Russia. You know our position, we are against the sanctions … China is not a side of the conflict in Ukraine, and we think that our normal trade cooperation with other countries should not be hurt. Even Europe is doing business with Russia as usual, you did not suspend trade with Russia completely, so our usual trade relations with Moscow should not be hurt,” he said.

Employment and the standard of living in China depends on the trade with other countries and with Russia as well, he said.

Italy 'won't veto sanctions on Russian gas'

(ANSA) - ROME, APR 4 - Italy's reliance ion Russian gas is hard to bear, Ecological Transition Minister Roberto Cingolani said Monday. "At this time the formidable energy reliance on Russia is really difficult to justify and to tolerate," he said on a video link to a new master's course at Milan's Bocconi and Politecnico universities. Cingolani said Europe was putting "huge" sums into Moscow's coffers and these were largely being used to fund Russia's war on Ukraine. "We must examine our consciences and I think the whole of Europe is doing so". Referring to the alleged Russian atrocities in the city of Bucha, Cingolani said "on the one side you see these images and what is happening and the first emotional reaction is to say what do we care about national energy security: but instead it is time to work on national energy security and to correct old errors". Meanwhile ENEL Managing Director Francesco Starace said the Italian power giant was poised to "resume a plan mothballed by previous governments seven years ago and put one billion euros into a regassification terminal at Porto Empedocle", in Sicily. He said it would enable Sicily to receive gas ships and "give flexibility in gas supplies". German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said Monday "every day we are increasing our independence from Russiaand the possibility of an embargo. "It is the right way to hurt Putin". The Financial Tines said further sanctions would be proposed by European Union members. But not all agree. Austria, for instance, said it was not in favour of new sanctions linked to gas, saying they would hurt Austria more than Russia. The EU's ambassadors will meet on Wednesday to discuss possible fresh sanctions on Moscow. Italy is ready to sanction Russian gas after the atrocities at Bucha, Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said Monday. Talking to ANSA after the Northern Adriatic Trilateral with his colleagues form Croatia and Slovenia in Zegrab, Di Maio said "Italy will not place vetoes on sanctions against Russian gas". Di Maio added that Italy was in favour of capping gas prices. Ambassador Stefano Sannino, the Secretary General of the EU External Action Service, said Monday that the European Union's sanctions on Moscow are likely to be ramped up further in the light of the evidence of atrocities committed by Russian forces in the Ukrainian city of Bucha. "Unfortunately, I think we will have a further stiffening of the sanctions on Russia after what we saw in Ukraine this week," Sannino told an ANSA Forum. "There are indications that Bucha is not an isolated case and this means a strong response from the EU (is required)". (ANSA).

0902 GMT - The Russian ruble rises after Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said Wednesday that the EU isn't considering halting gas imports from Russia. USD/RUB falls to a six-week low of 78.9540, according to FactSet. Draghi's comments suggest a full EU embargo on Russian energy is still a long way off, which will probably frustrate the U.S. given the ruble has recovered to pre-invasion levels, ING analysts say. "It seems only a full sanction of Russian energy (Russian gas sales generate about $10bn in FX per month) will be enough to see the ruble coming under severe pressure again--even if Russia does end up defaulting on its sovereign Eurobonds--as recent U.S. Treasury measures seem to intend."

The mansion of Russian oligarch Vladimir Solovyov in northern Italy was vandalized on Wednesday when several burning tires were thrown into the house over the wall. Firefighters were called to extinguish the blaze at the oligarch's lavish residence. According to the Daily Beast, the fire officer said the damage was not significant, but the message was clear: it was definitely a protest sign. The house, with stunning views of the lake, was being remodeled and is Solovyov's most recent purchase in northern Italy. Shortly after this fire, police discovered that a second mansion of the Russian's had also been vandalized, this time with red paint. Those responsible wrote the words war and murderer on the walls of the home and dyed the pool red to look like blood.Video surveillance footage of the two properties is being analyzed by Italian police.

"The Carabinieri investigations are ongoing, but we can already say that the vandals did not cause significant damage," Michele Spaggiari, mayor of Menaggio, said Wednesday.Solovyov, who is a presenter on Russian state television in Lake Como, has three luxury mansions in Italy, yet two of them have been confiscated by the Italian government. The third property is still in the oligarch's possession since it is registered in the name of a relative. The Italian government has confiscated several ventures and properties from Russian oligarchs in an attempt to sanction Russia for the warlike onslaughts in Ukraine.

0902 GMT - The Russian ruble rises after Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said Wednesday that the EU isn't considering halting gas imports from Russia. USD/RUB falls to a six-week low of 78.9540, according to FactSet . Draghi's comments suggest a full EU embargo on Russian energy is still a long way off, which will probably frustrate the U.S. given the ruble has recovered to pre-invasion levels, ING analysts say. "It seems only a full sanction of Russian energy (Russian gas sales generate about $10bn in FX per month) will be enough to see the ruble coming under severe pressure again--even if Russia does end up defaulting on its sovereign Eurobonds--as recent U.S. Treasury measures seem to intend." (renae.dyer@wsj.com)

0856 GMT - The euro-sterling exchange rate could fall to 0.82 in coming months from 0.8319 currently but that may be the extent of this year's decline, ING says. "The challenge for GBP will be if and when year-end market expectations for the Bank of England 's bank rate adjust closer to 1.00/1.25% (our house call) versus the 2%+ currently priced," ING analysts say. That adjustment is probably a story for the second half of 2022, however, they say. The BOE 's chief economist Huw Pill is due to speak at 1215 GMT and is unlikely to push back against current rate expectations given inflation looks set to accelerate. EUR/GBP will probably stay in the 0.83-0.84 range for now, they say. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)

0829 GMT - The European Central Bank is expected to continue with the announced reduction of asset purchases amid uncertainty from the Ukraine war, ING says. The meeting on April 14 is likely to show a widening rift between doves and hawks amid slowing growth and accelerating inflation, the Dutch bank says. "While the doves are likely to focus on the worsening economic outlook and high uncertainty, arguing in favour of a very gradual, if any, normalisation of monetary policy, the hawks have been very vocal in calling for at least two rate hikes this year." Gradual policy normalization--an end to net asset purchases and a deposit rate back to zero--is likely to bridge the rift between both sides, ING says. (xavier.fontdegloria@wsj.com)

0810 GMT - U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has been more aggressive than investors had been anticipating in his plans to tighten monetary policy, leaving the market scrambling to catch up, Sam Vereecke, chief investment officer for fixed income at Degroof Petercam Asset Management, says. "We haven't had a situation like this in 40 years, with high prices and central banks struggling to control them," he says. Even then, the previous economic environment and the position of central banks were quite different from today, which means the market doesn't have the benchmarks that would allow it to price accurately, he says. The market has entered "discovery mode," he says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

0736 GMT - Germany's industrial production rose only slightly in February, against the backdrop of strong growth in the previous months, as there are still signs of a significant increase in production for the 1Q, Commerzbank says. However, the outlook for the coming months has deteriorated again, the German bank says. "The war in Ukraine and the renewed lockdowns in China will again exacerbate the problems in the supply chains, with the result that many companies are more likely to curtail their production again," Commerzbank says. Therefore, the industrial sector is likely to put the brakes on the recovery of the German economy again at least in 2Q and 3Q, partially neutralizing the positive effects of the easing of Covid-19 restrictions, it says. (maria.martinez@wsj.com)

0725 GMT - Chinese domestic supply chains are facing mounting disruptions amid lockdowns as the country recorded more than 20,000 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, say Standard Chartered economists Hunter Chan and Shuang Ding in a note. "Tighter mobility restrictions appear to have disrupted local supply chains," the analysts say, noting that truck drivers and porters are in short supply due to stricter testing requirements. The analysts say that the domestic supply-chain snarls could then hurt foreign trade, and expect China's container throughput levels to decline as the Covid wave lingers. (yongchang.chin@wsj.com)

0659 GMT - Industrial production in Germany rose 0.2% on month in February, a solid headline in light of Wednesday's sales data, Pantheon Macroeconomics says. Overall, production was still 3.8% below its prepandemic level in February, due to a sustained shortage of intermediate goods preventing firms from processing orders, economists at Pantheon say. Yet Pantheon still thinks output rose through the first quarter as a whole. Even if production, including construction, fell 2.0% in March, which seems plausible in light of the slide in the German Automotive Association's production data, total output would still have advanced a solid 1.7% on quarter in 1Q, according to Pantheon's estimates. (maria.martinez@wsj.com)

0650 GMT - The fact that a large portion of Italy's debt is held by investors with a long-term investment horizon is among the technical factors contributing to the resilience of Italian government bonds, or BTPs, UniCredit Research says. The holdings of foreign investors are close to their lowest level since 2008, UniCredit adds. A further supportive factor is that most of 2022's net issuance is completed. "​We see upside risks to issuance from fiscal measures aimed at cushioning the effect of higher energy prices, although we expect the size to remain relatively low in absolute terms​," it says. ​(emese.bartha@wsj.com)

0650 GMT - ​​The widening of the 10-year Italian BTP-German Bund yield to 165 basis points, from an average of 110 bps in 2021 reflects a less-supportive monetary policy stance, says UniCredit Research. However, it doesn't see any additional pressure from this factor, given that forwards now price in a steep trajectory for the European Central Bank 's deposit rate, especially in 2023, it adds. ​For the 2022, money markets are pricing in approximately 50 bps of interest rate rise by the ECB , according to Refinitiv, but some market watchers consider this pricing excessive in light of the growth risks stemming from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The 10-year BTP-Bund yield spread trades slightly below 167 bps, down about 2 bps, according to Tradeweb . (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

0641 GMT - Industrial production in Germany increased 0.2% on month in February, from 1.4% in January, providing the last signal of what the economy could have looked like had the war in Ukraine not happened, ING says. "The war in Ukraine has not only dramatically changed the world but also the outlook for the German economy," ING says. In the first two months of the year, the German economy was on track for slightly positive growth in 1Q and a significant rebound thereafter, economists at ING say. But higher energy and commodity prices, new supply-chain disruptions, and elevated uncertainty and fear will weigh on supply and demand in the coming months due to the war, ING says. (maria.martinez@wsj.com)

0626 GMT - Some investors may be tempted by outright yields on the new French May 2038-dated OAT of more than 1.4%, say Mizuho 's rates strategists ahead of the launch of the new French government bond at an auction Thursday. While they see the new bond coming as cheap on the French bond curve, they note the French election tail risk ahead as well as the accounts of the European Central Bank 's March meeting, due later in the day. Based on this view, Mizuho 's strategists expect demand to be average at best. Grey markets, where bonds trade before their official launch, indicate the May 2038 OAT with a yield of 1.44%.

THE EUROPEAN Union is in chaos as Italy and Netherlands argue over the EU gas prices as energy prices skyrocket.

EU countries are split over whether to impose a cap on oil and gas prices in order to tackle the energy crisis that is hitting the bloc hard. Influenced by increased demand during a post-pandemic recovery, along with geopolitical tensions between Russia and the West pushed wholesale gas prices in the EU to record levels in the last quarter of 2021.

In an effort to curb the energy crisis, a growing number of EU countries are calling for setting a limit on gas prices, which continues to affect the cost of living for families and puts a strain on businesses.

Two countries, Netherlands and Italy, are at loggerheads with each other over whether to impose a price cap.

Amsterdam is joined by countries like Germany who have voiced their scepticism most sceptical about the measure.

According to Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, imposing the price cap “has risks”.

Meanwhile, Italy is on the opposite on the debate, demanding that the EU intervene in the energy markets.

Rome is also joined by Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Greece in calling for a price cap.

Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said: “Our governments have done their part and will continue to do so, but energy policy interventions cannot weigh only on the national budget, they must be structural.”

Thursday, Mr Draghi met with his Dutch counterpart, following which he noted that while their position still diverge, “progress has been made”.

After the visit, Mr Draghi told reporters that Mr Rutte promised to “examine all issues in favour which is much more than he had done so far.”

He added: “Breaking away from gas dependence is difficult, but this is a prospect if the war continues with the atrocities we are seeing.”

This meeting occurred on the same day that several EU lawmakers demanded a total ban on oil, coal and gas imports from Russia.

However, the move to sanction Russian energy is facing pushback from several EU nations, many of whom are extremely dependent on Moscow for their oil and gas needs.

Leading this pushback is Hungarian President Victor Orban, a key ally of Putin.

Mr Orban, who has just been re-elected to serve a fourth presidential term, has stressed that blocking Russia’s oil and gas imports are a “red line” as it would “kill Hungary”.

Part of his presidential campaign, which took him to victory on Sunday, was based on a pledge to maintain the security of gas supply for households.

Joining him in stopping gas sanctions are Austria, Italy and the Netherlands, who all fear that the move would cause chaos to their economies and energy security.

Up to a third of the EU's gas is supplied by Russia, and it also handed Putin a staggering €48.5billion for crude oil imports in 2021, and €22.5billion of petroleum oils other than crude.

SANTIAGO, Chile — Dozens of protesters gathered in front of the Russian embassy in Chile’s capital of Santiago on Saturday to denounce the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Protesters unfurled a large banner featuring the colors of the Ukrainian flag. The group included Ukrainians living in Chile.

Some protesters lay down on the ground and clutched stuffed animals to honor child victims of the war. A large banner read, “Stand with Ukraine.”

“We want to be united at this time with our children, with our families,” said Alina Prus, a Ukrainian living in Chile. “Several of us have our families who are now living the horror of what war means.”

Another protester, Dária Gryshko, said many Ukrainians living in Chile have family or friends living both there and in Russia.

“It is painful to see how families break up, how relationships break up, when opinions are divided within a family,” she said. “Because the people who live in Russia are exposed to a lot of propaganda, even when you show them video of what is happening now, they don’t believe, because they don’t come out from their TV.”

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS:

BORODIANKA, Ukraine — Firefighters continued searching Saturday for survivors or the dead in the debris of destroyed buildings in a northern Ukrainian town that was occupied for weeks by Russian forces.

Residents of Borodianka expect to find dozens of victims under the rubble of the several buildings destroyed during fighting between Russian forces and Ukrainian troops. The town is about 75 kilometers (47 miles) northwest of the capital of Kyiv and had more than 12,000 residents.

Russian troops occupied Borodianka while advancing towards Kyiv in an attempt to encircle it. They retreated during the last days of March following fierce fighting. The town is without electricity, natural gas or other services.

A 77-year-old resident, Maria Vaselenko, said her daughter and son-in-law’s bodies have been under rubble for 36 days because Russian soldiers would not allow residents to search for loved ones or their bodies. She said her two teenage grandchildren escaped to Poland but are now orphans.

“The Russians were shooting. And some people wanted to come and help, but they were shooting them,” she told The Associated Press. “They were putting explosives under dead people.”

MARIUPOL, Ukraine -- Shelling by Russian forces of Ukraine’s key port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov has collapsed several humanitarian corridors and made conditions seldom right for people to leave.

It was not clear Saturday how many people remained trapped in the city, which had a prewar population of 430,000. Ukrainian officials have put the number at about 100,000, but earlier this week, British defense officials said 160,000 people remained trapped in the city.

Ukrainian troops have refused to surrender the city, though much of it has been razed.

Resident Sergey Petrov said Saturday that recently two shells struck around him in quick succession, but neither exploded upon landing. He was in his garage at the time and said his mother later told him, “I was born again.”

“A shell flew in and broke up into two parts but it did not explode, looks like it did not land on the detonator but on its side,” he said.

He added that when another shell flew in and hit the garage, “I am in shock. I don’t understand what is happening. I have a hole in my garage billowing smoke. I run away and leave everything. I come back in several hours and find another shell lying there, also unexploded.”

ATHENS, Greece — A Ukrainian soccer club on Saturday opened a series of charity games on a government-backed “Global Tour for Peace” wearing the names of heavily bombarded cities on its jerseys.

The tour by the Shakhtar Donetsk club aims to raise money for Ukraine’s military in the war against Russia, and also help Ukrainian refugees displaced by the war.

Its first game Saturday was a 1-0 loss to Greek league leader Olympiakos.

Soccer clubs around Europe have been offering to play games against Ukrainian clubs and host youth players after soccer in the country was shut down when Russia invaded in February.

Shakhtar already was displaced from its home of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine in 2014.

Playing in the Athens area on Saturday, Shakhtar players replaced their names on the back of their jerseys with those of cities bombarded by Russian forces, including Mariupol.

BUCHA, Ukraine -- Civilians remaining in Bucha lined up Saturday for food donated by the local church in the battered Kyiv suburb where Ukrainian forces and journalists reported evidence of war crimes after Russian soldiers withdrew.

With other civilians fleeing in the wake of Russia’s invasion, most of the people remaining in Bucha were elderly, poor or unable to leave loved ones. Russian troops withdrew more than a week ago.

Volunteer Petro Denysyuk told The Associated Press that he and fellow church friends started providing food, with a wide array of basic foodstuffs and hot meals.

“We have gathered together with the youth from our church and prepared food for the needy,” Denysyuk said. “We prepared pilaf, boiled eggs, prepared meat, sausages, noodles.”

Ukrainian forces and journalists that went into Bucha saw bodies strewn in the streets, evidence of summary executions and the remains of people who could not have threatened soldiers. Russia has denied accusations of war crimes and accused Kyiv of staging them.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the leaders of Britain and Austria for their visits to Kyiv on Saturday and pledges of further support.

In his daily late-night video address to the nation, Zelenskyy also thanked European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for a global fundraising event that raised more than 10 billion euros ($11 billion) for Ukrainians who have had to flee their homes.

Zelenskyy said democratic countries were united in working to stop the war. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer became the latest of several European rulers to meet Zelenskky in Kyiv.

“Because Russian aggression was not intended to be limited to Ukraine alone, to the destruction only of our freedom and our life,” he said. “The entire European project is a target for Russia.”

Zelenskyy repeated his call for a complete embargo on Russian oil and gas, calling them the sources of Russia’s “self-confidence and impunity.”

“But Ukraine does not have time to wait. Freedom does not have time to wait. When tyranny begins its aggression against everything that keeps the peace in Europe, action must be taken immediately,” he said.

He added: “And an oil embargo must be the first step. Moreover, by all democratic states, the entire civilized world. Then Russia will feel it. Then it will be an argument for them to seek peace, to stop the senseless violence.”

LVIV, Ukraine — Eyewitness descriptions are coming from Kramatorsk, the town in eastern Ukraine where a missile hit a train station packed with evacuees on Friday.

The Sydorenko family could have been among the 52 dead and more than 100 wounded, but their taxi didn’t show and they had to wait for another one. They finally arrived for the 11 a.m. evacuation train just three minutes after the explosion.

Ivan Sydorenko says there were around 2,000 people inside the station and on the platforms when the missile hit. He says they got out of their taxi in a scene of burning cars, burning pieces of the missile and people fleeing for their lives.

Ivan managed to escape by bus and then train with his wife and daughter, eventually reaching the relative safety of Lviv in western Ukraine. The Sydorenkos are just one of thousands of families clamoring to leave eastern Ukraine ahead of an expected Russian onslaught there.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 10 evacuation corridors were planned for Saturday, and other stations were open for trains full of refugees.

Russia meanwhile has denied responsibility, accusing Ukraine’s military of firing on the station to try to turn blame for civilian slayings on Moscow.

KYIV, Ukraine — Panicked residents of eastern Ukraine boarded buses or looked for other ways to leave Saturday, a day after a missile strike killed at least 52 people and wounded more than 100 at a train station.

The attack in in Kramatorsk left the city with no trains running and came with thousands of people seeking to leave. Ukrainian authorities have called on civilians to get out ahead of an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the east.

Residents on Saturday feared the kind of unrelenting assaults and occupations by Russian invaders that brought food shortages, demolished buildings and death to other cities elsewhere in Ukraine.

“It was terrifying. The horror, the horror,” one resident told British broadcaster Sky, recalling Friday’s attack on the train station. “Heaven forbid, to live through this again. No, I don’t want to.”

Western military analysts said an arc of territory in eastern Ukraine was under Russian control. It was from Kharkiv — Ukraine’s second-largest city — in the north to Kherson in the south.

But Ukrainian counterattacks are threatening Russian control of Kherson, according to the Western assessments, and Ukrainian forces are repelling Russian assaults elsewhere in the Donbas region in the southeast.

WASHINGTON — U.S. intelligence officials predict Russian President Vladimir Putin may use U.S. support for Ukraine as justification for a new campaign to interfere in American politics.

Intelligence officials tell The Associated Press that they have yet to find any evidence that Putin has authorized measures like the ones Russia undertook in the last two elections to support former President Donald Trump. Several people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive findings said it remains unclear which candidates Russia might try to promote next.

Trump has repeatedly assailed U.S. intelligence officials and claimed that investigations of Russian influence on his campaigns to be political vendettas. In Ukraine and elsewhere, Russia has been accused of trying to spread disinformation, amplifying pro-Kremlin voices in the West and using cyberattacks to disrupt governments.

Top U.S. intelligence officials are still working on plans for a new Foreign Malign Influence Center, authorized by Congress, that will focus on foreign influence campaigns by Russia, China and other adversaries.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told The Associated Press on Saturday that he is committed to seeking peace despite Russian attacks on civilians that have stunned the world.

He said no one wants to negotiate with people who tortured their nation — “as a man, as a father, I understand this very well.” But he said “we don’t want to lose opportunities, if we have them, for a diplomatic solution.”

Zelenskyy said he’s confident Ukrainians would accept peace despite the horrors they have witnessed in the war. But meanwhile, Russian troops are regrouping for an expected surge in fighting in eastern Ukraine, including the besieged port city of Mariupol that Ukrainian defenders are battling to retain.

So Zelenskyy renewed his plea for countries to send more weapons. He says they have to fight for life -- not “for dust when there is nothing and no people. That’s why it is important to stop this war.”

___

KYIV, Ukraine — U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, promising so much support that his nation might never be bullied again.

Johnson’s surprise visit included a pledge of 120 armored vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems, part of another 100 million pounds ($130 million) of high-grade military equipment. Johnson also confirmed an additional $500 million in World Bank lending, taking Britain’s total loan guarantee up to $1 billion.

Johnson said Ukraine defied the odds pushing Russian forces “from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century.″

The prime minister credits “Zelenskyy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people” for thwarting what he calls the “monstrous aims” of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Johnson says Britain and its partners “are going to ratchet up the economic pressure ... not just freezing assets in banks and sanctioning oligarchs but moving away from use of Russian hydrocarbons.”

Johnson also described a vision for a future Ukraine so fortified and protected by the equipment, technology and know-how of Britain and its partners that it can never be threatened in the same way again. In the meantime, Johnson said, “there is a huge amount to do to make sure that Ukraine is successful, that Ukraine wins and that Putin must fail.”

MILAN — An Italian government source said Italian Premier Mario Draghi is traveling to Algeria on Monday to sign a deal for more gas.

Italy has been urgently looking for alternatives to natural gas from Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. Russia is Italy’s biggest supplier, representing 40% of total imports.

Italy’s foreign minister has traveled to Algeria as well as Azerbaijan, Qatar, Congo, Angola and Mozambique to secure more deals. Algeria is Italy’s second-largest supplier of natural gas, which is the main source of the nation’s electricity, providing some 21 billion cubic meters of gas via the Trans-Mediterranean pipeline.

Italian energy company ENI has operated in Algeria for 40 years. ENI announced a significant oil and gas discovery in Algeria last month and said it would work with Algerian partner Sonatrach to fast-track its development for the third quarter of this year.

Julian Lennon has explained why he decided to sing his father’s song “Imagine” for the first time publicly.

He’s posted on social media that he always said he would only sing the song if it was the End of the World. He says it’s the right song to sing now because “the War on Ukraine is an unimaginable tragedy,” and he felt compelled to respond in the most significant way he could.

The son of John Lennon says murderous violence in Ukraine is forcing millions of innocent families to leave the comfort of their homes. He says the lyrics reflect our collective desire for peace worldwide, and “within this song, we’re transported to a space, where love and togetherness become our reality, if but for a moment in time.”

Lennon joined celebrities around the world calling on world leaders to do more to support refugees in the Stand Up For Ukraine campaign.

BOSTON -- The International Monetary Fund has created an account to give donor countries a secure way to funnel financial assistance directly to war-ravaged Ukraine.

The multilateral lender said in a statement Friday that it’s launching the account at the request of several member countries.

The goal is to help Ukraine meet its payment obligations and help stabilize its economy using loans or grants from pooled resources.

The IMF says Canada has proposed routing up to 1 billion Canadian dollars ($795 million) to Ukraine through the new account.

Two weeks after Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, the IMF approved a $1.4 billion emergency loan to Ukraine.

___

BOSTON -- S&P Global Ratings has downgraded its assessment of Russia’s ability to repay foreign debt, signaling increased prospects that Moscow will soon default on such loans for the first time in more than a century.

The credit ratings agency issued the downgrade to “selective default” Friday night after Russia arranged to make foreign bond payments in rubles last week when they were due in dollars. It said it didn’t expect Russia to be able to convert the rubles into dollars within a 30-day grace period.

S&P said it believes sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine are likely to increase, impeding its willingness and ability to honor its obligations to foreign debtholders.

The Kremlin has signaled it’s willing to pay its debts but warned it would do so in rubles if its overseas accounts in foreign currencies remain frozen.

WARSAW, Poland – The head of the European Union’s executive branch says 10.1 billion euros ($11 billion) have been raised globally in a fundraising event for Ukraine and people who have fled the country invaded by Russia.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was joined at the event in Warsaw by Polish President Andrzej Duda and -- remotely -- by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

At the end of the 90-minute event, a smiling von der Leyen said the donations will go to help refugees, both outside and inside Ukraine.

“We will continue providing support. And once the bombs have stopped falling, we will help the people of Ukraine rebuild their country,” von der Leyen said.

Saturday’s pledging event was held in Warsaw because more than 2.5 million of the 4.4 million people who have fled Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began Feb. 24 have entered Poland. Many have stayed, though some have moved on to other countries. The event aimed to prompt political leaders and global celebrities to provide funding and other donations for the people of Ukraine.

It ended with Julian Lennon singing his father John Lennon’s peace song “Imagine.”

MOSCOW -- YouTube has banned the channel of Russia’s lower house of parliament, the State Duma, prompting government officials to renew longtime threats against the platform.

The Duma TV channel reported the ban on the messaging app Telegram, noting that it had 145,000 subscribers and over 100,000 million total views. In comments to the Russian news agency Interfax, Google didn’t give an exact reason for the move, but said the company follows “all applicable sanction and trade compliance laws.”

Russia’s state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor demanded that YouTube unblock the channel. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Saturday that the service “has handed itself a sentence” and urged its users to “download content, transfer it onto Russian platforms. And fast.”

State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin called the move against the parliament’s YouTube channel “another proof of violations of the rights and freedoms of citizens by Washington.”

Rome, Apr 11 (EFE).- The Italian police on Monday seized properties in Sardinia owned by Russian former Formula 1 driver Nikita Dmitrievich Mazepin and his oligarch father valued at more than 100 million euros (about $109 million), Italian government sources confirmed. "A preventive seizure order was executed against Dmitri Arkadievich Mazepin and his son Nikita Dmitrievich Mazepin, regarding the villa" known as Rocky Ram and located in the village of Porto Cervo, in northern Sardinia, the sources said. The operation was carried out by the Finance Guard - Italy's financial police - and is part of the effort by Italian authorities to sanction Russian oligarchs linked to President Vladimir Putin within the framework of the European Union sanctions on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Both Mazepins - senior and junior - had been placed on the EU sanctions list.

Italian police in recent weeks have seized several villas and yachts valued at more than 900 million euros from Russian multimillionaires who have been sanctioned by the EU, including a yacht belonging to Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko valued at more than 500 million euros. Nikita Mazepin on March 5 had his contract canceled by the US-owned Haas Formula 1 team, a result of the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine and the EU punishment being implemented against Russia on multiple levels.

Mercedes and Red Bull's title chances rated by ex-boss after early season setbacks

FERRARI have taken a grip on the Formula 1 title chase early this season, but time is on Red Bull and Mercedes' side as they look to launch a comeback.

Despite Charles Leclerc stretching a considerable lead over his peers thus far in the new F1 campaign, it's too early to write off the likes of Red Bull and Mercedes. That's the view of former team chief Giancarlo Minardi, who has suggested small changes could be all that's required to restore some competition at the head of the grid.

Ferrari currently look like good value to win their first F1 world championship since Kimi Raikkonen guided them to the crown in 2007. Leclerc leads the way on 71 points—34 ahead of Mercedes newcomer George Russell in second—while Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen have staggered out of the blocks and sit fifth and sixth, respectively.

Two wins from three has put Leclerc in the ascendancy for a maiden world title. He and third-placed team-mate Carlos Sainz are the only drivers in the field to have podiumed in more than one race thus far, with Leclerc claiming wins in Bahrain and Australia.

Even though the Dutchman's points tally is almost a third of Leclerc's, Verstappen need not be dismissed in the bid to retain his crown, however. "Verstappen is not that far behind," Minardi, 74, told Milanese daily Corriere della Sera.

Helmut Marko takes swipe at Max Verstappen driving style - 'over the limit'

A second retirement in three races has left the titleholder clambering for a foothold in the drivers' standings early on. However, victory in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix—as well as Sergio Perez's runner-up finish in Melbourne on Sunday—has shown Red Bull remain relevant.

Both they and Mercedes have been plagued by engineering issues early on this year, but Minardi went on to suggest those can be easily rectified. "Reliability problems can slow down the development of the car, but solving them can be quick," he continued. "In such a long championship, it's too early to write them off."

The Minardi team founder hailed Leclerc's display at the Australian Grand Prix as "untouchable," praising the Monegasque for his at-ease approach: "The way Leclerc won in Melbourne said a lot. With confidence and serenity."

Greater tests are to come, however, particularly if Ferrari's main nemeses cure their current car complaints. That will be put to the test once more when the season gets back underway with the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix on April 24.

Addresses from the Chair Suzanne Heywood and the CEO Gerrit Marx

Annual General Meeting

Addresses from the Chair Suzanne Heywood and the CEO Gerrit Marx

April 13, 2022

Lady Heywood

Dear Shareholders,

Last year I chaired the shareholders' meeting of CNH Industrial, where the spin-off of its On-Highway Business was approved, paving the way for the birth of today's Iveco Group NV.

Now I have the honour to chair the first AGM of our new Company. But although Iveco Group is new, it can build on a 119-year legacy of success, dedication and know-how. It also benefits from the experience and commitment of a strong management team, a hard-working workforce, the trust of its customers and - I hope - your support as shareholders.

This new company is focused on commercial and mass transport, powertrain technologies and specialty vehicles.

I would like to congratulate the combined CNHI and Iveco Group team that planned and executed the separation flawlessly. I am now excited about the future of this new company and the benefits it will get from addressing its markets with renewed focus and vigor.

Alongside completing the critical last steps needed to prepare for separation in January of this year, Iveco Group also continued to deliver for its customers. In doing this it relied on the lessons learnt during the initial phases of the pandemic. These have made us more resilient and better positioned to achieve our priorities.

Although the pandemic persisted through 2021, we were able to navigate these challenges, working closely with our suppliers and dealers, while helping our employees readjust to the new ways of working.

In November 2021, Iveco Group's CEO, Gerrit Marx, and his Senior Leadership Team, held its first Investor Day. During this presentation they shared details of its plans and financial ambitions through to 2026.

Iveco Group has also signed The Climate Pledge, a commitment founded by Amazon and Global Optimism. This commits the group to reaching net zero carbon by 2040, which is ten years ahead of the goal set by the Paris Agreement. This pledge underlines the importance the company places on its ESG obligations, including those related to workplace and on-road safety, inclusivity & diversity, and managing the lifecycles of its products in an environmentally friendly way.

Last year also saw the inauguration of our joint investment with the US-based Nikola Corporation for the production of heavy-duty Battery and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles in Ulm, Germany. We have already started producing heavy-duty battery electric vehicles in Ulm and these will be followed, in 2023, with production of fuel-cell heavy-duty trucks. Both of these trucks will be commercialized in Europe and in North America.

Iveco Group began working with the French multinational Air Liquide in 2021 to accelerate the development of heavy-duty hydrogen mobility in Europe. The company also made a significant step forward with Plus as its European partner in a pilot programme for the validation and integration of the Plus autonomous truck technology with Iveco's latest-generation S-WAY heavy-duty truck.

In its first few months as an independent company, Iveco Group continued to be proactive in creating mutually beneficial partnerships.

One example of this is the memorandum of understanding that the company signed in early March with Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea. The two companies will now work together to assess the potential to cooperate in multiple areas including electric powertrains, fuel-cell systems, vehicle automation and connectivity.

Another instance is the partnership for e-mobility in Europe that Iveco is setting up with Enel-X. The Group intends to be a regional leader in this area, acting as a driver in new technologies and opportunities.

This year will be pivotal for the development of Iveco Group. I am confident, however, that the company has both the confidence and the capabilities required to face the challenges and opportunities ahead in an ever-changing industry.

The last two years have been challenging for our business as we have, alongside others, lived through and managed the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. We now additionally face the challenges emerging from the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding in Ukraine.

As a responsible organization, we have of course abided by all the sanction provisions and extraordinary measures in relation to Ukraine and Russia.

In addition, we have taken steps to protect our people and their families in the areas of conflict and to provide support to local organisations assisting the general population. With our local partner, we have donated Magirus firefighting turntable ladders and delivered them to the Polish border. We are now evaluating the possibility of donating other vehicles to help communities impacted by the conflict.

We have also identified three Non-Profit Organisations that share our priority of safeguarding the health and well-being of all and furthering education in Ukraine. AVSI, Soleterre and WeWorld each have a long history of working directly with local populations and are well established in the region so they can effectively reach the people in most need. The Company is also matching all donations made by Iveco Group employees worldwide.

In closing, the Board of Directors and I fully endorse the ambitious and achievable plans set out by Gerrit Marx and his leadership team. We wish them the very best as Iveco Group moves forward with great energy in its first year of independent operations.

I also wish to thank you, our valued shareholders, for your continued support.

I now turn the call to Gerrit.

Mr. Marx

Thank you, Suzanne, and welcome to all our shareholders joining our first Iveco Group annual general meeting as independently listed company.

Before going into the merits of my speech, I would like to associate myself with Suzanne's words of support with regards to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. We had reacted weeks before the invasion with precaution measures and shortly after the start of the invasion we moved our employees and families out of Ukraine to rented apartments in Poland. Besides vehicles also our powertrain division FPT industrial supports with gensets for local power production.

The Annual Report published on March 1, 2022, which we are bringing to your approval, is an unusual document for an AGM because it presents the Company-only financial statements of the newly formed Iveco Group N.V. legal entity for the period June 16, 2021 which was the date of incorporation of Iveco Group N.V. - to December 31, 2021.

You should consider that until December 31, 2021, Iveco Group N.V. was a subsidiary of CNH Industrial N.V., specifically set up in June 2021 with the purpose of receiving assets (mainly investments in Group subsidiaries), liabilities and equity on January 1, 2022, following the Demerger. As a consequence, those financial statements reflect only the results determined by the start- up activities of a basically "empty box", which until December 31, 2021 was not yet the holding company of the new Iveco Group.

In this context, the Demerger qualifies as the first "subsequent event" for Iveco Group N.V. and therefore the effects of the Demerger are not included in the 2021 results, but are only disclosed as Subsequent events in the specific paragraph/footnotes. In this respect, in order to give an idea of some indicators of the Group following the Demerger, in the Subsequent events footnote we included few figures related to Group's Revenues, Adjusted EBIT and Net Industrial Cash position as already published on February 8, 2022 as "Combined (carve - out) consolidated F/S" for Iveco Group.

The Company-only financial statements of the legal entity are presented in the second part of the document, starting from page 30, and are not representative of Iveco Group N.V. post Demerger.

The document is unusual also for the following reason: considering that at the moment of the filing (March 1, 2022) Iveco Group N.V. was no longer an empty box, but already the listed holding company of our Group following the Demerger, it qualified as a Public Interest Entity and therefore we have been requested to include, in the first part of the document (the so- called "Board Report"), the usual chapters required by Dutch/EU law

NIKITA MAZEPIN lost his race seat ahead of the 2022 season after Haas parted company with the Russian.

Nikita Mazepin’s family villa valued at over £100million has been taken over by authorities as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues. The huge plot, situation on the Italian island of Sardinia, is priced at £118m and was seized after an impounding order was served.

A spokesperson for the Italian Financial Police told the Daily Mail: “Following verifications on subjects that are part of the current European Union sanctions list, an impounding order was served on Dmitry Mazepin his and his son Nikita Mazepin, a driver with the Formula 1 team Haas until March 5, on a residential complex worth 105 million Euro and traceable to both through an overseas company.”

The house - known as Rocky Ram - was purchased by the family in 2012. It has a whopping 25 rooms with views over the Mediterranean. The villa also comes with a sculpted garden and its own private swimming pool.

An official said the property was in the name of the former Haas star and his father.

EU sanctions lists describe Dmitry as a “member of the closest circle of Vladimir Putin." Mazepin was dropped by Haas after it cut ties with his father Dmitry’s Russian company UralKali ahead of the new season.

The Russian took part in the team’s preparation for the new campaign but was let go ahead of the second pre-season test. He was replaced by Kevin Magnussen days before the start of the new season.

The Dane has starred despite limited preparation and has scored 12 points across the first three races. Ahead of the Australian Grand Prix, Mazepin spoke out about Haas’ decision to terminate his contract.

The 23-year-old even hinted he would fight the decision and branded the move as “cancel culture”.

He said: “I don't agree with being in the sanctions. I've said previously that I intend to fight it.

"Perhaps now is not the right time because if you look at the whole situation that's happening against athletes in the general case, it's cancel culture against my country." Mazepin added the war made for painful viewing but refused to comment further on the crisis.

He added: “It's very painful to watch that on many levels. My feeling obviously changed as a human being and as a person who wants to live in a very peaceful world.

"But I see tremendous risks in saying anything at all about this case because I will never satisfy everyone and therefore I will keep myself publicly quiet."

Presenting national artists in Venice is a brew of politics, money and culture

While 80 countries from Albania to Zimbabwe are participating in this year’s Venice Biennale, the national pavilion of one traditional participant now stands closed and empty: that of the Russian Federation.

The pavilion — built just before the 1917 Soviet revolution and renovated last year — was to feature artists Kirill Savchenkov and Alexandra Sukhareva, with work focusing on premonitions about humanity’s future, including the looming risk of an “information autocracy”. But days after Russia invaded Ukraine, the two artists declared they could not represent their country at Venice in the face of the conflict, while their Lithuanian-born curator Raimundas Malasauskas also resigned, saying the situation was “politically and emotionally unbearable”.

The Russian government subsequently said the country was formally withdrawing from the event, though the organisers insist they put no pressure on Moscow to pull out. “The Biennale has never censored or prevented countries from participating,” Roberto Cicutto, the Biennale’s president, tells the Financial Times.

The shuttered Russian pavilion reflects the sometimes fraught relations between global governments and their artistic communities, which can affect how and whether countries participate in the world’s biggest display of contemporary art. It also puts a renewed focus on how countries get into the Venice Biennale in the first place, which ultimately comes down to politics, money — and even art.

The exhibition’s fundamental organising structure is rooted in the model laid down at the first Venice Biennale in 1895 and was inspired by the other great global exhibitions of the era, when governments played the lead role in curating and “representing” their countries to a curious world. Belgium built the first foreign national pavilion in the Giardini, the Biennale’s chief exhibition area, in 1907.

In its first decades, the Biennale was mainly a showcase for art from wealthy western countries. But in the wave of decolonisation that followed the second world war, newly freed nations started seeking to participate — to make their presence felt at an event that draws curators and collectors from around the world.

“Venice is the closest the art world gets to the Olympics — it’s the one place where, literally, the world shows up,” says London-based curator Hammad Nasar, who curated the UAE’s national pavilion at the 2017 Biennale. “It’s where the global art world will take notice of you.” 

“It’s not very different from when small or postcolonial nations win their first Olympic gold,” adds Nasar, who was also on among the panellists that selected artist Sonia Boyce to represent the UK at this year’s Biennale. “It’s that moment when people say, ‘Oh yes, we are world class.’”

But some say its embodied nationalism seems out of sync with the current era. “It’s a very late-19th-century, early-20th-century, fin-de-siècle structure — it’s not of this time,” says Monica Narula, a member of the New Delhi-based Raqs Media Collective. “Different people try to express the present moment in that past moment. Sometimes they succeed, sometimes they don’t.”

No matter how vibrant a country’s contemporary art scene, their participation in the Venice Biennale, through a national pavilion, depends on two main factors: support — at least tacit — of their government, and sufficient funds to mount an exhibition, including shipping the art and renting space in Venice for countries that don’t have historic pavilions.

Obtaining government sanction is critical for a country’s participation — and the factor perhaps most carefully vetted by the Biennale organisers. As a result, political or official apathy towards contemporary art can leave a country unrepresented. Excessive political interference can also affect the quality of the work on display.

For example, in 2019, India’s national pavilion — which was mostly funded by art collector and philanthropist Kiran Nadar — was dedicated to the memory of independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, a figure typically of greater concern to politicians than contemporary artists. Though India was a regular Biennale participant in the years after its independence, it will be absent this year, which Indian artists complain reflects the current government’s apathy towards contemporary art.

Afghanistan participated once in 2005, a few years after US forces drove out the Islamist Taliban and installed a more favourable government, but has not officially participated since.   

In countries with established public arts programmes, the selection of artists for a national pavilion is typically insulated from governments and entrusted to publicly funded but operationally autonomous foundations. The British Council has been responsible for commissioning artists to represent the country at the Biennale since 1937, and each year appoints a panel of arts professionals to make the choice.

Securing funding is another big challenge, especially for smaller countries with limited public money for the arts. But even wealthy countries, such as the UK, often count on philanthropy, private foundations and (when their artists are being shown) commercial galleries to help bear the costs, which start at several hundred thousand dollars.

In some cases, countries overcome financial and logistical hurdles by banding together to put up a joint pavilion — such as in 1990, when Nigeria and Zimbabwe teamed up, and in 1993, when the Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal had a shared pavilion. In 2013, four nations — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan — participated jointly in the shared Central Asian pavilion, while the Nordic countries Finland, Norway and Sweden have participated in a joint pavilion since the 1980s, with a few exceptions.

But many countries make their first appearance at the Biennale thanks to the determination of a few passionate individuals who feel their countries should be part of the event and work tirelessly to obtain government sanction, organise funding and undertake all the logistics to make it happen.

In the UAE, Dr Lamees Hamdan, a medical doctor and avid collector, was the driving force behind the country’s first Biennale appearance in 2009. But the government and large foundations later became more involved and in 2013 the UAE signed a long-term lease on space in Venice to host its permanent national pavilion.

Lagos-based gallerist Adenrele Sonariwo was keen to see Nigeria represented and undertook much of the effort behind the country’s first national pavilion in 2017, including raising the $300,000 needed for the costs. But Nigeria has not participated since. “It’s a massive effort and it took a lot out of me to make it happen,” Sonariwo says. “It has now been left open for somebody else to take that leadership role and go ahead, but we haven’t seen that happen. I would love to see our government prioritise it.”

She says that even the single appearance at Venice gave Nigerian artists a significant boost. “There was quite a light shining at that time. There are a lot of ripple effects that we are experiencing even years later.”

While Russia will be conspicuous by its absence, Ukraine, which first participated in the Biennale in 1928 and then reappeared in 2001 after the collapse of the Soviet Union, will be very much present. One of its curators, Maria Lanko, managed to evacuate parts of the work in her car while fleeing the war, and the team has received support from the Biennale itself, which is helping with the costs of the production and transport of the planned work, now being made in Milan.

Even given today’s political situation, this Biennale is no different from those of decades past: it is still a mix of political and financial power that determines which countries participate — and what works they show.

“When you present yourself through art, the world has the tools to understand whether the choice of an artist is made for propaganda reasons or is even an instrument of oppression,” says Cicutto. “This is a line that the Biennale intends to pursue.”

Italy has banned Russian-flagged vessels from its ports from Sunday as part of the EU’s fifth sanction package against Russia.

In compliance with the EU directive released on 8 April, the circular from the General Command of the Port Authorities has forbidden entry into Italian ports to Russian-flagged vessels and ships that changed their flag after 24 February in a bid to avoid sanctions.

Russian vessels that will no longer be able to enter Italian ports include passenger and cargo vessels carrying over 500 gross tonnes and those employed in commercial activities and international shipping. Ships anchored in the country will have to leave soon after completing their activities.

Few exceptions are allowed. The circular says that the ban does not apply “in case of a vessel in need of assistance or in case of an urgent port call for maritime safety reasons”, the circular says.

This ban was introduced the same weekend the Italian ambassador returned to Kyiv, reinforcing the country’s position alongside Ukraine. The embassy in Ukraine, which closed on 3 March after Russia’s invasion, hoisted its flag again and will be fully operational from Monday (18 April).

“The reopening of our embassy in Kyiv, more than fifty days after the beginning of the conflict, is for us a symbolic and hopeful moment”, the Italian ambassador in Ukraine, Pier Francesco Zazo, said on Saturday. “Today, we feel even closer to the Ukrainian government and people, and we will continue to assist our compatriots as best we can”, he added.

How Draghi and Italy played crucial role in putting sanctions on Russia; Former ECB chief was key to freezing Kremlin’s $600bn foreign currency reserves bulwark

The single most painful sanction imposed on Russia has been the joint western move to block the Russian central bank's access to its foreign currency reserves.

In actions that now seem prescient, Russia had worked to build up an estimated $600 billion (€552 billion) in foreign currency reserves since its annexation of Crimea in 2014, as a bulwark against the effect of any sanctions to come.

One European leader was key to recognising the strategy and understanding how to combat it: Italian prime minister Mario Draghi.

Draghi led the European Central Bank from 2011 to 2019 and has a strong relationship with the US treasury secretary Janet Yellen, built during their time when they jointly fought crises at the helm of the EU and US central banks.

The importance of this relationship was highlighted in a Financial Times article recently that described a scene on the third day of the invasion, when EU officials were anxiously waiting for confirmation from Washington about the plan to freeze the reserves, and nervous that Moscow could get wind of it first.

"We were all waiting around, asking, 'What's taking so long?'" an EU official recalled to the newspaper. "Then the answer came: Draghi has to work his magic on Yellen."

Moscow didn't see it coming. The sudden lack of access to the reserves hobbled its ability to intervene to support the rouble, and this week Russia's central bank chief, Elvira Nabiullina, vowed to try legal action to get them back.

"This freezing of gold and foreign exchange reserves was unprecedented," she was quoted to say by the Russian Tass news agency.

The revelation of the significant behind-the-scenes role of the Italian leader is something of a corrective to reports that emerged in British media early in the war, that cast Draghi as personally intervening to get a sanctions carve-out for luxury goods.

Long table An important industry for Italy, luxury goods had been discussed by lower-level officials prior to the invasion, as the EU worked pre-emptively to build consensus on sanctions. But the Italian government flatly rejects that it was an issue once the Russian tanks rolled in.

Indeed, sanctions on luxury goods were duly imposed by the EU on March 14th, banning the export to Russia of individual items worth more than €300.

This will hit Russian elites, whose taste for Italian luxury has been visible. The now-famous long table at which Vladimir Putin was pictured during meetings in Moscow was claimed by Renato Pologna as the work of his northern Italian furniture company Oak. He estimated its value at €100,000, part of an order worth €20 million delivered to the Kremlin in 1995.

When Putin appeared to address a patriotic pro-war rally in Moscow last month, he was wearing a navy parka worth €12,000 by Italian ultra luxury brand Loro Piana. Embarrassed, the company was forced to publicly distance itself from the regime and explain it had already stopped sales in Russia.

The reality is that Italy has taken a tougher stance on Ukraine than could have been the case.

In previous decades, strong economic and political ties grew between Moscow and Rome. This was illustrated most luridly at the height of a 2009 sex scandal, when a leaked recording of then-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi revealed he had a piece of furniture known as "Putin's bed".

Italy's parliament has no shortage of erstwhile Putinophiles and, in other circumstances, Rome could have posed a significant problem for EU unity.

But despite Italy being one of the countries most dependent on Russian gas, Draghi has said he will not block EU sanctions on the fossil fuel.

He has moved to secure alternative supplies from Algeria, while levelling with the public that they may have to use less air conditioning this summer.

This has left Germany exposed as the major force in Europe opposing such a move.

Some of the most striking illustrations of Europe's changed relationship with Russian wealth came in the videos issued by the Guardia di Finanza, showing their police officers boarding the sumptuous yachts that usually float around off the Italian coast each summer.

Italy has a well-honed apparatus for going after Mafia assets and financial crime, which was helpful when it came to seizing the assets of sanctioned oligarchs. But political will was also required. Decisions to seize assets covered by sanctions are made within national ministries of finance.

In a press conference last month, Draghi was being deliberate when he chose to switch to English to make a point that such political will was lacking elsewhere.

"I'd really like to see similar measures taken by all our countries," he said. "Now we must all be rapid in the implementation of this."

MARKET WRAPS

Watch For:

Eurozone Construction output; Germany Ifo Index; UK BOE Asset Purchase Facility Quarterly Report, CBI Industrial Trends Survey; updates from Vivendi , Deutsche Boerse, Bollore, Roche, TotalEnergies , Generali, Philips, ING, Hikma Pharmaceuticals

Opening Call:

Fed hawkishness and Covid-related lockdowns in China will combine to weigh on European stocks. In Asia, most major benchmarks were at least 2% lower; the dollar continued its ascent; Treasury yields and gold dipped; and oil prices fell around 3%.

Equities:

The slide in European stocks is likely to continue Monday, as investors grapple with a likely aggressive Fed rate path and lockdown fears in China.

Losses in Asian markets were heavy following Wall Street's biggest one-day drop since 2020, with the Dow finishing nearly 1,000 points lower on Friday.

"It would seem investors have been too complacent about the upcoming [Fed] meeting, which will need to change," said Michael Kramer, founder of Mott Capital.

The Cboe Volatility Index VIX, +24.38%, an options-based measure of expected volatility over the next 30 days, had been too low heading into the May 3-4 FOMC meeting, Kramer said. It rose Thursday and was up another 19.5% at 27.1- on Friday, moving above its long-term average just below 20.

Economic Insight--S&P on the U.K., Italy and Greece:

S&P said it expects U.K. GDP growth of 3.5% this year, below its previous forecast of 4.6% made in December of last year.

"Upward price pressures, aggravated by the fallout from Russia's military intervention against Ukraine, are driving real incomes lower," S&P said. The U.K. is a net energy importer, and exposed to the conflict's impact on oil and gas prices, according to S&P.

It affirmed its 'AA/A-1+'sovereign credit ratings on the U.K with a stable outlook.

---

S&P revised down Italy's GDP growth projection for 2022 to 3.1% from 4.4%.

"The Russia-Ukraine conflict poses a risk to Italy's open industrialized economy via trade, supply chains, oil and gas prices, and confidence effects."

Even as inflation hit 30-year highs in Italy, S&P said it believes "the government's ongoing delivery of key structural and fiscal reforms will boost long-term potential growth and, ultimately, benefit Italy's public finances."

S&P affirmed its unsolicited 'BBB' long-term and 'A-2' short-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings on Italy, with a positive outlook.

---

S&P upgraded its long-term sovereign credit rating on Greece to BB+ from BB with a stable outlook.

S&P said the upgrade reflects it expectation of continuous improvement in Greece's policy effectiveness. Fallout from the war in Ukraine appears manageable, with S&P adding that the war is the key driver of its projection Greek GDP growth will slow to 3.4% in 2022, from 8.3% last year.

Inflation was 8% in March, a 27-year high, but there is no evidence so far of upward pressure on wages, according to S&P. It affirmed Greece's short-term rating at B.

Forex:

The dollar added to gains in Asia as worries about U.S. rate rises continued to hit sentiment.

Capital Economics' Jonathan Petersen said the equities selloff is behind the recent appreciation this time around. "The dollar is in a 'heads I win, tails you lose' situation. Either U.S. yields rise further and widening yield gaps help the dollar, or risk appetite worsens on worries about the economic outlook and that drives dollar strength."

The yen also strengthened on the possibility of foreign-exchange intervention.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Japan Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki discussed a potential coordinated yen-buying intervention at a meeting in Washington, major Japanese broadcaster TBS reported Friday, citing an unnamed Japanese source. The tone on the U.S. side was one of "positive consideration," said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.

Capital Economics' Jonas Goltermann said diverging interest rates will keep the yen weak and drive the USD/JPY to 140 by the end of this year "before dropping back as the Fed takes its foot off the gas in 2023."

Goltermann said the yen has depreciated around 10% against the dollar since early March, mainly because the BOJ "has stuck to its ultra-loose policy stance," while the Fed is aggressively tightening.

Japan's terms of trade "have also worsened significantly on account of the surge in commodity prices," Goltermann said, warning that the BOJ is under pressure to change its policy, which could support the yen.

The euro could rise toward $1.15 from $1.0805 currently if the European Central Bank raises interest rates by more than market expectations to tame inflation, Unicredit Research said.

The ECB could raise its deposit facility rate 100 basis points above the 1.5% peak that is priced in by markets over a two-year horizon, Unicredit forex strategist Roberto Mialich said. That could prompt the forex market to favor more pronounced EUR/USD long positioning, or bets on the pair price rising.

"The intensity of the EUR rally would also depend on the extent to which high inflation also affects the U.S. economy, possibly forcing the Federal Reserve to deliver even more tightening than that already priced in."

Bonds:

Treasury yields edged lower early Monday, with bonds in demand and as investors position for a tighter Fed policy.

Traders continued to assess comments made by Fed policy makers, with Cleveland's Loretta Mester saying Friday that she backed a 50 basis point hike in May "and a few more" to get the fed funds rate target to 2.5% by year-end.

Mester also the central bank wants tighter financial conditions, "but not necessarily all at once," and that "we don't need to go" to a 75 basis point hike.

Piper Sandler 's Roberto Perli said the [recent] rise in yields signaled that inflation expectations could get out of control and become a headache for the Fed. "History has shown that every time the Fed has to raise rates aggressively, growth suffers. The risk of recession five to six quarters ahead is high."

Energy:

Crude futures were down almost 3% in Asia, with China's Covid outbreak and expectations for aggressive interest-rate increases by the Fed continuing to dull prospects for energy demand.

China has placed movement controls on parts of Beijing after new virus cases were found, triggering fears of lower demand if mobility trends worsen, ING commodities strategists Warren Patterson and Wenyu Yao said.

"The Covid situation in China appears to be moving in the wrong direction with Beijing seeing a spike in cases over the weekend. China's zero-Covid policy means that oil demand will be taking a hit as authorities try to bring the outbreak under control."

The outlook for oil demand is uncertain given that on the one hand, there's a potential GDP slowdown due to rising interest rates and on the other hand, there's potential demand destruction due to high energy prices, Manish Raj, chief financial officer at Velandera Energy Partners, told MarketWatch.

Developments relating to Russia's invasion of Ukraine will remain in focus, as the current situation addes pressure on the EU to sanction Russian oil, ANZ said. Meanwhile, the U.S. has recently announced fresh sanctions on Russia by banning entry of Russian ships to the U.S. ports.

Oil prices settled lower Friday, contributing to a more than 4% loss for the week.

Metals:

Gold prices extended losses, with Fed policy and China the main factors weighing on sentiment.

OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley has put support for the precious metal at $1,940/oz and resistance at $1,980/oz.

---

Aluminum was lower too, with prices down more than 1% in Asia.

Brokerage Marex noted that vehicle sales in China from January to March were weaker than expected amid chip shortages and Covid-related curbs, a further sign of weakening aluminum demand. However, low inventory levels and a tight supply outlook should limit the losses, Marex added.

Higher Oil Prices Have Yet to Lure Back Secondary Buyers

Improvements in oil prices over the past year may be bolstering cash flows at some private equity-backed oil-and-gas companies but it hasn't lured secondary buyers back to bid for interests in funds focused on the sector, at least not yet.

"You can't trade private-equity energy funds off of spot oil prices," said Michael Dean, managing director in the real assets team at HarbourVest Partners , adding that higher oil prices have made companies more profitable but have yet to contribute to a significant uptick in exits by oil-and-gas funds.

   
 
 
Japanese Yen's Drop Raises Potential for Broader Market Trouble

The Japanese yen has dropped to a 20-year low against the U.S. dollar. That risks being bad news far beyond Tokyo-in the $23 trillion market for U.S. Treasurys.

Traders around the world watch the yen's rise and fall not just to follow Japanese markets but also to gauge how investors globally are feeling. Usually, when markets are rallying, the yen tends to weaken against other currencies. When markets get turbulent, the yen tends to gain ground.

   
 
 
Covid-19 Cases Jump in Beijing as New Deaths Triple in Shanghai

HONG KONG-Beijing said it is at a critical point in its efforts to halt a Covid-19 outbreak in the city, as new cases spread from school students and a tour group, while deaths in Shanghai more than tripled from a day earlier.

The Chinese capital recorded 22 new cases on Sunday, its highest daily tally this year. Shanghai, which a week ago had recorded no new deaths in the latest wave of infections, said 39 Covid patents died Saturday-more than three times Friday's toll.

   
 
 
The Fed Wants to Raise Rates Quickly, but May Not Know Where to Stop

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is shifting monetary tightening into a higher gear. His goal sounds straightforward-lift interest rates to "neutral," a setting that neither spurs nor slows growth.

25 Apr 2022 00:18 ET EMEA Morning Briefing: Fed, China Covid Fears to -2-

But there's a catch: Even in normal times, no one knows where this theoretical level is. And these aren't normal times. There are good reasons to think the ground beneath the central bank's feet is shifting and that, after accounting for elevated inflation, neutral may be higher than officials' recent estimates.

   
 
 
Iron Ore, Steel Futures Slump on China Lockdown Fears

Iron ore and steel futures slump as demand expectations are weighed by Shanghai's extended lockdown and fears that other parts of China, including Beijing, may be subject to similarly harsh curbs.

The most-traded September iron ore contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange fell as much as 11% on Monday. They were recently 8.4% lower at 815.0 yuan ($125.35) a metric ton. Iron ore futures in Singapore also declined by as much as 11% in response to the negative sentiment and were recently 6.2% lower at $141.40 a ton.

   
 
 
Fed's Mester doesn't support interest-rate hike of 75 basis points in May

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Friday that she didn't want to "shock" the economy with an interest-rate hike of 75 basis points at the Fed's next meeting in May.

"I favor a more methodical approach rather than a shock of a 75-basis point. I don't think it's needed with what we're trying to do, with our policy," Mester said in an interview on CNBC.

   
 
 
Credit Suisse Prepares for Fresh Round of Management Turnover

Credit Suisse Group AG is preparing for another management shuffle after a year of crisis, people familiar with the matter said.

The Swiss bank said Sunday that its board hasn't made decisions but that it is reviewing senior appointments and succession plans. Long-serving executives in roles including the chief financial officer, general counsel and Asia head could be shifted out as the bank makes changes, said people familiar with the matter. A search was under way last fall for a new general counsel, according to the people.

   
 
 
France's Emmanuel Macron Wins Second Term in Presidential Election

PARIS-French President Emmanuel Macron was re-elected by a wide margin, according to projections based on early ballot counts, overcoming deep divisions among voters worried about inflation, the war in Ukraine and the impact of immigration on France's national identity.

Mr. Macron garnered 58.8% of the estimated vote Sunday, while far-right leader Marine Le Pen won 41.2%, according to a projection from polling firm Ipsos .

   
 
 
Nestlé Rejiggers Operations to Keep Supplying Food in Ukraine

Nestlé SA is rejiggering its operations and supply chain to keep factories running in Ukraine, while ramping up efforts to get food donations to the hardest hit parts of the country.

After Russia invaded in February, many big multinationals suspended operations in Ukraine, citing concerns about employee safety, labor shortages and the difficulty of getting raw materials into the country.

   
 
 
Russia Blocks Economic Data, Hiding Effect of Western Sanctions

The West's window into the Russian economy is closing.

In recent days, authorities stopped publishing data on government debt, trade statistics and oil production. The central bank limited the volume of financial information that local banks have to publish regularly while lawmakers are working on a bill banning lenders from sharing data with foreign states.

   
 
 
Ukraine's Grim Economic Toll From War Confronts World Governments

WASHINGTON-Top world financial officials gathered in Washington this past week confronted a grim picture of the growing economic costs of Russia's war in Ukraine and the challenges they face to help pay Ukraine's short- and long-term bills.

Ukraine needs around $5 billion a month in budgetary support for up to five months and roughly $600 billion for a broader rebuilding effort, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Thursday at a forum hosted by the World Bank during spring meetings held with the International Monetary Fund .

   
 
 
Sanctions Strand Thousands of Russia-Bound Luxury Cars

Some 8,000 luxury cars destined for Russia are parked at the Port of Zeebrugge in Belgium as authorities there try to navigate a maze of sanctions slapped on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.

The cars-including some of the latest Lexus, Cadillac and Mercedes models-arrived from Asia in the first week of April. They were supposed to be transshipped to Russia, but came under a luxury ban that prohibits vehicles worth more than EUR50,000, equivalent to $54,000, from being exported. The buildup of vehicles is one example of the confusion at key European ports over how to interpret and enforce sanctions against Russia.

The Ukraine Crisis: Italy Probes Allegations of Sanction Evasion

Italian lawmakers are investigating allegations that an unknown number of Italian companies are evading sanctions on Russia by using front companies in Central Asia.

The companies are said to have knowingly sold their goods to Russian customers that have set up offices in Kazakhstan and other central Asian countries, according to investigators.

Members of Confindustria, a powerful lobby representing Italian employers, flagged to the government the companies dodging the sanctions. The parliamentary committee for the security of the republic, known by its Italian acronym Copasir, subsequently began an investigation.

"February 24 was a watershed that changed the geopolitical situation and some people evidentially haven't realized that," said Enrico Borghi, a parliamentarian and member of Copasir, referring to the day Russia invaded Ukraine. "What was once tolerated is tolerated no more."

Copasir, which is tasked with overseeing Italian intelligence agencies, doesn't know how long the investigation will take, said Mr. Borghi.

The committee also is busy with other dossiers connected to the war, and has ongoing investigations tracking Chinese influence in Italy and cybersecurity attacks.

"As you can imagine, sanctions dodging is one of many issues the government is dealing with regarding the war," said Mr. Borghi.

Confindustria and Copasir declined to comment on which companies are alleged to be involved, how many there are or which industries they are in.

BRUSSELS officials will head to Italy this morning to gloat about the EU in the three-day event for the State of the Union while member states appear more divided than ever.

EU Commissioners and leaders will try to woo guests at a three-day event in Florence from today in a bid to convince the world the bloc is "fit for the Next Generation". The conference will be held from May 5 to 7 and will focus on the future of the EU. The event's invitation reads: "Two years from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU’s importance in shaping a better future has never been clearer.

"The State of the Union is a platform for experts and civil society members from all over the world to debate urgent crises.

"This year’s edition of the EU’s annual policy conference will focus on the European Union’s role in a constantly evolving global landscape.

"Leaders and Experts from all over the world will deal with issues ranging from multilateral governance to sustainability and resilience, democracy and the rule of law, to the developments in attitudes to migration, the future of digitalisation, and how crisis can fuel change."

EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is not expected to join the event, but her Vice-President Josep Borrell will give a speech on Friday on the security architecture of the bloc.

Free movement chief Commissioner Marie-Helene Boulanger will also participate this afternoon.

Regardless of the enthusiasm that will be shown to boast about the EU at the event, the bloc is appearing more divided than ever this year.

Speaking to Express.co.uk ahead of the conference, Nexit Denktank researcher Gabriel van de Bloemfontein said: "It is really strange to me that some unelected bureaucrats have the audacity to speak about democracy on behalf of the Dutch people.

"They're not more democratic than China. Just by saying they're democrats, doesn't mean they really are.

"If the EU truly cared about what the people think, they would have looked very carefully into the mirror when the British voted to leave in 2016. They did not do this for one second, but instead they accelerated their federalist ambitions.

"During this State of the Union they will say how glorious and strong the EU is, while in reality it is a very divided artificial union. They can barely ever agree on important topics such as sanctions, rule of law and gay rights.

"Stronger together? More like weaker together."

Member states are increasingly clashing among themselves and the EU Commission over issues of rule of law, sanctions against Russia, energy reforms and trade.

Over the past few years, the EU executive has been locking horns with Poland and Hungary over rule of law disputes culminating with the Commission officially triggering a mechanism that could see Budapest lose its funds.

The so-called rule of law mechanism was triggered last month after being introduced in recent years to combat EU states' misuse of EU funds, something that Hungary has been accused of repeatedly.

Despite years of criticism by rights campaigners that he was channelling EU funds to his associates, Viktor Orban won a fourth consecutive election victory earlier this year.

The European Commission responded by launching its new sanction tool.

Vera Jourova, deputy head of the Brussels-based Commission, said: "We identified issues that might be breaching the rule of law in Hungary and affect the EU budget.

"Hungary will have to reply to our concerns and propose remedial measures."

Poland has also been threatened by the Commission with the same mechanism but it has so far not been punished by the EU executive.

Denouncing the Commission's war on Poland and Hungary, Italian MEP Susanna Ceccardi said: "The European Commission is using the most subtle means against Hungary and Poland simply because these nations have center-right governments.

"The announcement of the start of the procedure came right after Viktor Orban's victory in the recent elections, incredibly and shamefully. What is it but a punishment and a warning against those voters who voted against the will of the European left? And what could be further from democracy than such blackmail?"

Poland, as Ms Ceccardi pointed out, has received over 3 million refugees from Ukraine.

She continued: "This is why Europe should show its solidarity and not threaten countries with useless sanctions. We have heard many legitimate concerns about respect for the rule of law, but we are underestimating a much more serious danger: that the principle of subsidiarity on which the Union is founded is violated."

On Ukraine and Russia the bloc is also deeply divided.

The European Union proposed its toughest sanctions yet against Russia on Wednesday, including a phased oil embargo, as Moscow pressed an offensive in eastern Ukraine and close Russian ally Belarus announced large-scale army drills.

But a first meeting of EU envoys on Wednesday ended without a deal, mostly because of some countries' criticism of the oil ban and other oil-related measures, such as a ban on EU shipping services for Russian oil, officials said.

The EU depends on Russian oil and gas, and faces the task of finding alternatives when energy prices have surged.

A handful of Central European countries are concerned that the halt will come too soon for them to adapt, even though diplomats said Hungary and Slovakia would be given until the end of 2023.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Facebook that, even with that extension, Hungary could only agree to the measures if crude oil imports from Russia via pipeline were exempt from the sanctions. Slovakia has publicly asked for a three-year transition period.

Reluctance to deliver measures that damage EU economies as well as Moscow faded in recent weeks as Russia's invasion of Ukraine brought horrific images of slaughter in towns and concern about a renewed offensive in the east of the country.

The Commission's measures include phasing out supplies of Russian crude oil in six months and refined products by the end of 2022. It also proposed to ban in a month's time all shipping, brokerage, insurance and financing services offered by EU companies for the transport of Russian oil worldwide.

If agreed, the embargo would echo the actions of the United States and Britain, which have already imposed bans to cut one of the largest income streams to the Russian economy, as the West buys more than half of its crude and petroleum products from Russia.

Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic raised concerns about the oil embargo at a meeting of envoys from the EU's 27 governments on Wednesday, a source said, noting however that a deal could be achieved at another meeting on Thursday or later this week.

The EU's reliance on Russian energy has sparked fury in the European Parliament on Tuesday.

Speaking at the latest plenary session, ID Group leader Marco Zanni said: "Today we realize that we need to become more autonomous about procurement, but I urge everyone not to repeat the same mistakes of the past: switching from Russian to Chinese dependence, for example, cannot be considered a winning strategy.

The highest officials of the Union must reconsider the decisions of the past and reflect on the answers to the enormous questions that the dramatic conflict in Ukraine has posed to us: is this still the right direction to follow? Was it wise to rely on the leadership of a single country to outline the political and strategic path of an entire continent? Is it really essential to insist on proposing ideological recipes for real problems? What is needed now is more pragmatism, less ideology; more concrete actions, fewer announcements. On the topics you touched on: work, energy, environment and defence.

"To find a solution, the EU can refer precisely to the energy issue. As we are seeing, the energy mixes vary from country to country, needs and lifestyles are different, depending on the capital in which we are located. I hope that this state of affairs, which is both reality and metaphor, can finally push these European institutions to abandon the one size fits all rhetoric which in many cases has made the completion of the European project itself an obstacle and not a resource as it should. to be. It is not a crime to admit mistakes and change course, but it must be done in time."

On Green policies, one of Ms von der Leyen's dearest projects for the bloc, member states are yet to agree on a common strategy with French President pushing for nuclear energy to be labelled green and northern countries trying to oppose the move.

The French President hopes that having the sustainable energy label could boost France's struggling nuclear energy industry, which was bailed out by the state in 2017 following construction delays and cost overruns.

But Mr Macron's ambition to classify nuclear energy as green has already been met with opposition from other EU member states including Germany.

The French leader was also sent a thinly-veiled threat by Austrian leader Karl Nehammer.

Mr Nehammer said: "Austria is clearly against nuclear energy, we are against a green washing of nuclear energy, this is a good tradition in Austria.

"We have allies here, including Luxembourg, but of course also powerful opponents, who are proponents of nuclear power.

"But we will not shy away from this discussion and will continue it vehemently."

France generates about three quarters of its electricity in nuclear reactors operated by state-owned utility EDF.

The European Union is preparing a rulebook on climate friendly investments, which will define which activities can be labelled as green in sectors including transport and buildings.

The EU's aim is to restrict the green investment label to climate-friendly activities, steer cash into low-carbon projects and stop companies or investors making unsubstantiated environmental claims.

Member states seem to also struggle to agree on its enlargement. Last year, EU leaders failed to come to an agreement over Ms von der Leyen's plans to supersize the bloc.

The 27 leaders promised future membership to their six Balkan neighbours restating a pledge first made 18 years ago, but they brushed aside calls for a 2030 goal for fear of a backlash at home over migration.

After weeks of deliberation, EU leaders agreed that Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania have a place in the world's largest trading bloc if they fulfil the criteria on areas from judicial reform to economics.

But with the "enlargement process" blocked by various disputes in Brussels and Serbian political leaders reluctant to ever recognise Kosovo's 2008 independence, many in the Balkans feel the EU declaration is an empty statement.

The Commission President called the Balkan countries "family", while French President Emmanuel Macron struck a conciliatory tone, saying the Balkans were "at the heart of Europe" and deserved a pathway to membership.

But northern countries such as Denmark, France and the Netherlands fear a repeat of the rushed accession of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007 and the poorly managed migration of eastern European workers to Britain that turned many Britons against the EU.

Bulgaria is against North Macedonia, already a NATO member, joining because of a language dispute.

Speaking of migration, southern EU member states have been locking horns with their northern neighbours for years in a relentlessly failed bid to come up with a new migration policy for the equal allocation of refugees across the bloc.

To make things worse, ahead of Russia's attack on Ukraine, the pressuring situation on the border between the bloc and Belarus pushed more EU leaders to back boarder walls and fences last year, urging the EU Commission to approve funds for their construction.

The first to propose such a drastic physical solution was Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in the midst of the 2015 migration crisis that crippled the bloc.

At the time, Mr Orban was alone in his quest, which was promptly dismissed by the then European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.

When five years ago Greece proposed a wall on its border with Turkey, Mr Juncker also dismissed the call saying: “No fence and no wall is high enough to deter these people from coming to Europe."

Last year, Ms von der Leyen renewed Juncker's position after Lithuania called on the EU to fund a wall on its border with Belarus.

She said: “There will be no funding of barbed wire and walls."

But EPP President Manfred Weber, the leader of largest group in the European Parliament, went against the Commission chief and supported Lithuania's demands.

He said: “We, as EPP, we are also asking that in an extraordinary situation EU funds must be available to finance these kinds of activities."

On the other hand, the Socialists & Democrats, the second-largest group in the Parliament, are staunchly opposed to the idea.

In October, 12 EU countries led by Lithuania urged the Commission to fund barriers “as a matter of priority" in a letter.

Greece, which supports a mandatory redistribution of asylum seekers across the bloc - opposed by Hungary - also signed the letter.

France, however, is opposed to the idea the EU should fund member states' border policies.

French European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune said at the time: “I am in favour of a Europe that protects its borders, but not a Europe that puts up barbed wire or walls."

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Friday authorized the shipment of another $150 million in military assistance for Ukraine for artillery rounds and radar systems in its fight against Russia’s invading forces.

Biden said the latest spending means his administration has “nearly exhausted” what Congress authorized for Ukraine in March and called on lawmakers to swiftly approve a more than $33 billion spending package that will last through the end of September.

“We are sending the weapons and equipment that Congress has authorized directly to the front lines of freedom in Ukraine,” Biden said in a statement. “U.S. support, together with the contributions of our Allies and partners, has been critical in helping Ukraine win the battle of Kyiv and hinder Putin’s war aims in Ukraine.”

A U.S. official said the latest tranche of assistance includes 25,000 155mm artillery rounds, counter-artillery radars, jamming equipment, field equipment and spare parts.

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS:

UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations Security Council has unanimously adopted its first statement since Russia’s military action began Feb. 24, expressing “strong support” for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ efforts to find a peaceful solution to the “dispute” in Ukraine.

The short statement adopted at a brief meeting Friday does not mention a “war,” “conflict” or “invasion” as many council members call Russia’s ongoing military action, or a “special military operation” as Moscow refers to it. Russia, which holds veto power in the council, has blocked all previous attempts to adopt a statement or resolution.

Instead, the statement “expresses deep concern regarding the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine” and “recalls that all member states have undertaken, under the Charter of the United Nations, the obligation to settle their international disputes by peaceful means.”

During recent visits to Moscow and Kyiv, Guterres reached an agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the evacuation of civilians, first and foremost from the besieged southeastern port city of Mauripol and the Azovstal steel plant where the last Ukrainian forces are holding out along with hundreds of civilians in underground bunkers.

ROME — The Italian finance minister has adopted a decree that will impede a mega-yacht from sailing away from a Tuscan port, after investigation indicated the luxury vessel Scheherazade has links to “prominent elements of the Russian government.’’

The finance ministry also said in statement Friday evening that the probe, carried out by Italy’s financial police corps, found “significant economic business links of the beneficial owner” of the Scheherazade as well to other subjects included in a list issued in 2014 as part of European Union measures prompted by Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

There have been fears that the 140-meter (459-foot) long yacht, which has been in dry dock in the port of Marina di Carrara, was preparing to sail out of Italian waters soon. Based on the Italian investigation, Minister Daniele Franco adopted a “freezing decree’’ regarding the yacht, which flies the flag of the Cayman Islands and which had “long been under the attention of the authorities,’’ the statement said.

A few weeks after Russia’s war against Ukraine began, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a speech to Italian lawmakers, urged Italy to continue freezing assets of Russian oligarchs and officials. He cited by name the Scheherazade, which, according to some reports, belongs to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The Italian ministry statement didn’t identify the boat’s owner nor specify who are the “prominent” elements of the Russian government. But it said the “actual owner” of the Scheherazade should be included in the 2014 EU sanctions list.

KYIV, Ukraine — The regional governor says one person was reported dead and three more were injured Friday as a result of Russian shelling in Lyman, a city in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region.

“Russia is killing civilians! On May 6, as a result of Russian shelling, one civilian of the Donbas was killed in Lyman. Three more people were injured,” Pavlo Kyrylenko wrote in a Telegram post.

The Donbas, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland, encompasses the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Kyrylenko’s claims could not be immediately verified.

___

KYIV, Ukraine — A top official from Ukraine’s interior ministry has warned against “the activation of saboteurs and other criminal elements” in the lead-up to Russia’s Victory Day on Monday.

Speaking to Ukraine’s state-run Ukrinform agency, First Deputy Interior Minister Yevhen Yenin said authorities were carrying out “special operations” in a number of Ukrainian cities to “prevent possible provocations.”

“We receive information about the potential shelling of peaceful territories, and therefore I appeal to every Ukrainian, especially these days, not to ignore air raid sirens,” he added.

Moscow commemorates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II on May 9 each year.

Fifty civilians were evacuated Friday from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, Ukraine.

In a statement, the Russian Interdepartmental Humanitarian Response Center says the 50 civilians include 11 children.

Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, also said 50 civilians left the plant without giving a breakdown of how many were children.

Both Vereshchuk and the Russian body said the evacuation of civilians from Azovstal will continue Saturday.

Ukrainian fighters holed up at the sprawling complex are making their last stand to prevent Moscow’s complete takeover of the strategic port city.

___

UNITED NATIONS — Members of the United Nations Security Council, including Russia, have agreed on a statement expressing “strong support” for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ efforts to find a peaceful solution to the “dispute” in Ukraine.

The council scheduled a meeting later Friday to adopt the brief statement, which would be the first approved by the U.N.’s most powerful body since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

It does not mention a “war,” “conflict” or “invasion” as many council members call Russia’s ongoing military action, or a “special military operation” as Moscow refers to it.

The statement, drafted by Norway and Mexico, “expresses deep concern regarding the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine” and “recalls that all member states have undertaken, under the Charter of the United Nations, the obligation to settle their international disputes by peaceful means.”

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reached an agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the evacuation of civilians, first and foremost from the besieged southeastern port city of Mauripol and its last Ukrainian forces holdout at the Azovstal steel plant where hundreds of civilians are also still living in underground bunkers.

The U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross have carried out two successful evacuations from Mariupol and surrounding areas so far and are currently trying to arrange a third from the steel plant.

Russian state agencies reported that two self-proclaimed separatist republics in Ukraine’s industrial east both appointed extraordinary ambassadors to Moscow on Friday.

Olga Makeeva, the deputy chair of the legislative assembly of the Donetsk People’s Republic, was chosen by the territory’s Russia-backed government as its representative. Her counterpart from the Luhansk People’s Republic is Rodion Miroshnik, a foreign policy adviser to the separatist territory’s leader.

A Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman condemned the appointments, saying Makeeva and Miroshnik will likely face criminal punishment for high treason.

“It’s a country of crooked mirrors. Russia has created pseudo-republics. It appointed ambassadors, from itself to itself… These ‘diplomats’ will face the most severe responsibility. As will other traitors,” Oleg Nykolenko wrote in a Telegram post Friday.

The Russian foreign ministry has released a statement congratulating Makeeva and Miroshnik on taking office, wishing them success in “establishing and developing multifaceted and mutually beneficial cooperation between our countries.”

KYIV, Ukraine — Officials from Ukraine’s national security council warned residents Friday against the increased risk of shelling on Sunday and Monday, coinciding with Russia’s Victory Day celebrations.

A Facebook post published on the profile of the Center for Counteracting Disinformation, under the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, urged Ukrainians not to ignore air raid sirens.

“Since Russian troops cannot boast of any significant achievements on the front by Victory Day, the risk of massive shelling of Ukrainian cities these days is increasing,” the post said.

Separately on Friday, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said authorities will not be extending the curfew in Kyiv; one has already been introduced. But street patrols would be reinforced.

Moscow commemorates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II on May 9 each year.

AIR FORCE ONE — White House press secretary Jen Psaki says President Joe Biden will meet virtually with other Group of Seven leaders Sunday along with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The virtual meeting will occur just before Russia’s Victory Day on Monday. Psaki says the date of the meeting is significant because it shows the unity of the allies ahead of a day when Russian President Vladimir Putin hoped to mark his victory over Ukraine. But Russia has been bogged down by Ukrainian forces and hampered by financial and trade sanctions.

Speaking Friday aboard Air Force One, Psaki says the G7 countries will discuss the war, its global impact, Ukraine’s future and building on the existing sanctions.

Psaki says she does not have any additional sanction details to share.

KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian army said Friday it had made progress in the northeastern Kharkiv region, recapturing five villages and part of a sixth.

“As a result of the offensive by units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, control was restored over the settlements of Aleksandrovka, Fedorovka, Ukrainka, Shestakovo, Pobeda and part of the village of Cherkassky Tishki,” said a Facebook post published Friday afternoon on the official profile of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

A village in Russia’s southern Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, is being evacuated due to shelling from Ukrainian territory, the regional governor said Friday.

Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that as of Friday afternoon, fewer than 30 people remained in the village of Nekhoteevka, located directly next to a border crossing.

“We have already taken most of the residents to a safe place,” he said, adding that five houses had been damaged by shelling. His post featured two photos of what appeared to be the same damaged building.

The accuracy of Gladkov’s claims could not be immediately verified, nor did his post specify the number of people currently living in Nekhoteevka. Russia’s 2010 census referenced the village as having 145 permanent residents.

___

KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian governor of the eastern Luhansk region accused Russian troops Friday of “terrorizing” residents of a frontline city as they try to advance across the Seversky Donets River.

In a Telegram post, Serhiy Haidai said more than 3,500 residents of the city of Kreminna had found themselves in Russian-controlled territory.

“The captured city is teeming with Russian military equipment. Fighting is going on in the vicinity,” he wrote. “The Russians are terrorizing the population in every possible way: from checking phones to forcibly disappearing Ukrainian patriots. … Almost every house has been looted.”

He added that Kreminna suffered from food and electricity shortages and that mobile communications had been shut down.

The accuracy of his statements could not be immediately verified.

SONCHAMP, France — In lush fields southwest of Paris, farmers are joining Europe’s fight to free itself from Russian gas.

They’ll soon turn on the tap of a new facility where crops and agricultural waste are mashed up and fermented to produce “biogas.” It’s among energy solutions being promoted on the continent that wants to choke off funding for Russia’s war in Ukraine by no longer paying billions for Russian fossil fuels.

Small rural gas plants that provide energy for hundreds or thousands of nearby homes aren’t — at least anytime soon — going to supplant the huge flows to Europe of Russian gas that powers economies, factories, business and homes. And critics of using crops to make gas argue that farmers should be concentrating on growing food — especially when prices are soaring amid the fallout of the war in Ukraine, one of the world’s breadbaskets.

Still, biogas is part of the puzzle of how to reduce Europe’s energy dependence.

TURIN, Italy — Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra’s upbeat, melodic entry for this month’s Eurovision Song Contest was written as a tribute to the frontman’s mother.

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it has become an anthem to the war-ravaged motherland.

“Stefania” is the most-watched song on YouTube among the 35 national entries that are slated to compete when the Eurovision contest takes place next week in Turin, an industrial city in northern Italy.

While some oddsmakers and data analysts have predicted other contestants will win, the song by Kalush Orchestra is quickly becoming a sentimental favorite.

“I’ll always find my way home, even if all roads are destroyed,’’ Kalush Orchestra frontman Oleh Psiuk wrote in the lyrics for “Stefania.”

His words have become more poignant as missiles pound Ukrainian cities and villages, forcing more than 11 million to flee since Russia invaded the country.

___

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said Friday that 41 more Ukrainians were released that day in a prisoner swap with Russia.

Iryna Vereshchuk wrote on Telegram that the 41 people who've been returned include 28 military personnel and 13 civilians.

MOSCOW — Russia has no intention of deploying tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Friday, a day after Moscow’s top diplomat in the U.S. chided Western officials for targeting it with “baseless” accusations.

“Russia firmly abides by the principle that there can be no victors in a nuclear war and it must not be unleashed,” Alexey Zaitsev said. He added that Russian nuclear doctrine does not envisage any scenarios for potential strikes which would apply to Moscow’s military goals in Ukraine.

Nevertheless, Zaitsev added that “any provocations whatsoever can be expected” from Ukraine and the West, and that Russia has to “be ready for any development in the media space and directly on the ground.”

His statement echoed remarks made by Russia’s ambassador in Washington on Thursday.

In an interview with Newsweek, Anatoly Antonov slammed what he called “a flurry of blatant misrepresentation of Russian officials’ statements on our country’s nuclear policy.” He accused top U.S. military leaders — including the Defense Secretary and Joint Chiefs of Staff — of falsely blaming Moscow for escalating nuclear tensions, calling their claims “baseless” and “part of a propaganda campaign against Russia in response to the steps taken to neutralize threats to our national security emanating from the Ukrainian territory.”

He also blamed the wider Western bloc for what he called its “irresponsible” handling of the situation in Ukraine, implying that NATO’s rhetoric and continuing support for Kyiv contributed to heightening nuclear tensions.

“The current generation of NATO politicians clearly does not take the nuclear threat seriously,” Antonov told Newsweek.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov and Russia’s parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin both asserted this week that Moscow would not use nuclear weapons first.

A Russian senator said Friday that Russia will remain “forever” in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson, whose capital has been occupied by Moscow’s troops since early March.

Andrey Turchak from the ruling United Russia party visited Kherson on Friday, meeting with its Russian-appointed governor Volodymyr Saldo.

“I want to say once again - Russia is here forever. There should be no doubt about it,” Turchak is heard saying in a video published by Russia’s state RIA Novosti agency.

“We will live together, develop this rich region, rich in historical heritage, rich thanks to the people who live here,” he added.

When asked about the future formal status of the Kherson region, Turchak cautioned against “running too far ahead” and said that “in any case, the status is determined by the residents.”

LONDON — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he has invited Germany’s head of government and its head of state to visit Ukraine on May 9, the day Russia marks the victory of the Soviet Union over Nazi Germany in World War II.

Western officials believe Russian President Vladimir Putin could use the Victory Day holiday to make an announcement about the war — either declaring a victory or escalating the conflict.

Germany is part of the Western alliance supporting Ukraine, but Chancellor Olaf Scholz has yet to make a solidarity visit to the country. Scholz has traded barbs with Ukrainian officials in recent weeks because of Kyiv’s refusal to invite Germany’s head of state, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whom Ukraine accuses of cozying up to Russia during his time as foreign minister.

Speaking at London’s Chatham House think-tank on Friday, Zelenskyy said he had spoken to Steinmeier and invited both him and Scholz to come to Kyiv.

He said Scholz “can make this very powerful political step to come here on the 9th of May, to Kyiv.”

There was no immediate word on whether the German politicians had agreed. German Parliament President Baerbel Bas is scheduled to visit Ukraine on Sunday and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock is due to visit soon.

BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says his country is providing Ukraine with “all the support we can give and also take responsibility for” in its war with Russia.

Speaking to business leaders in Hamburg on Friday, Scholz said Russia must not gain the upper hand in the conflict, which he described as a “war of destruction” waged by Moscow against Ukraine.

The German leader said that Russia’s position as a global power with a seat on the U.N. Security Council means that “if (Vladimir) Putin gets away with it then there’s a risk of international lawlessness.”

___

LONDON — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he is still open to negotiations with Russia, but he repeated his position that Moscow must withdraws its forces to their pre-invasion positions.

Zelenskyy told a meeting at London’s Chatham House think-tank on Friday that “regaining the situation as of the 23rd of February” — the day before the invasion — is a prerequisite for talks.

He said “in that situation we will be able to start discussing things normally,” and Ukraine could use “diplomatic channels” to regain its territory.

The British government, a key ally of Ukraine, has said Russia must be driven from all of Ukraine, including Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014.

Despite Russia’s intensified attack on Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, Zelenskyy said there is still space for diplomacy. He said “not all the bridges are yet destroyed,” figuratively speaking.

Asked whether Russia would soon take full control of the besieged port city of Mariupol, Zelenskyy said: “Mariupol will never fall. I’m not talking about heroism or anything … There is nothing there to fall apart. It is already devastated.”

BERLIN — Police in the German capital are bracing for possible confrontations between pro-Russia and pro-Ukraine protesters around the anniversary of the end of World War II.

Berlin police said Friday that security around 15 memorial sites across the city will be stepped up on May 8 and 9, and officers will crack down on any attempts to glorify Russia’s attack on Ukraine.

The Russian government has tried to portray the leadership in Kyiv as ‘Nazis’ — a claim both Ukraine and Germany have ridiculed.

Berlin’s police chief Barbara Slowik said authorities have banned the use of Russian or Ukrainian flags, the playing of military music or the wearing of uniforms or the orange and black ribbon of St. George showing support for the Russian military anywhere near the memorial sites.

German news agency dpa quoted police saying that some 3,400 officers will be deployed throughout the city on both days.

Rome says move is pending new Brussels’ sanctions amid reports vessel was ready to sail

Rome has moved to seize a $700mn superyacht docked in a Tuscan port pending a decision on its beneficial owner being included in the European Commission’s forthcoming package of sanctions against Russia.

Daniele Franco, Italy’s finance minister, has issued “a decree to freeze the asset pending a decision by the European Union”, the Rome government said in a statement on Friday evening.

An investigation by the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, had revealed evidence of “significant economic and business links of the beneficial owner of the Scheherazade with prominent elements of the Russian government and other individuals subject to EU sanctions”, it went on.

The statement said Italy had proposed that the beneficial owner of the boat — who the government has not publicly named or identified — should also be formally subject to EU sanctions, as they are not currently on the sanctions list.

But with the EU still debating its next sanctions package — particularly the contentious question of whether to impose an embargo on the purchase of Russian oil — Rome moved to freeze the ship as an interim measure.

The seizure follows media reports that the 140-metre-long Scheherazade had been preparing to leave the northern Tuscan port of Marina di Carrara, where it had been undergoing repairs and maintenance for months at a shipyard owned by the Italian Sea Group.

Local residents said the superyacht’s refitting had been completed this week. The vessel boasts six deck levels, two helicopter pads, and a swimming pool among its features.

Italian authorities have been investigating the superyacht’s ownership for weeks as part of efforts to enforce EU sanctions against oligarchs linked to Russian president Vladimir Putin.

In the past, Italy has been a favoured playground for many of the wealthiest Russians, reflecting the warm ties enjoyed by the Italian political and business establishment with Putin and his circle.

But prime minister Mario Draghi has been strident in his denunciations of the invasion of Ukraine, which the Italian leader has described as an attack on the post-second world war multilateral order.

Italian authorities have been enforcing the punitive EU sanctions with energy, freezing more than €1bn worth of superyachts and seafront villas linked to oligarchs seen as being close to Putin, such as Alexei Mordashov, Petr Aven and Alisher Usmanov.

But the Scheherazade had drawn particular attention, as associates of imprisoned Russian anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny have contended that the superyacht is probably Putin’s.

As evidence of its links to the Russian president, Anti-Corruption Foundation activists pointed to a crew list, suggesting that several members of the ship’s company were members of Russia’s Federal Protection Service, which is responsible for Putin’s security.

According to documents seen by the FT, Scheherazade’s nominal owner is Beilor Asset Limited, a Marshall Islands-based company.

According to two people briefed on discussions in Rome and Brussels, Italy requested the addition of the ship’s alleged beneficial owner to the EU’s sanction list on Thursday.

According to two officials briefed by the Italian investigation, the financial police first linked the superyacht to the individual in March. In early April, investigators asked the finance ministry’s financial security committee to demand the individual be included in the sanctions.

ANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news.

MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Welcome to our viewers in the United States and all around the world, I am Michael Holmes at CNN in Atlanta. Thank you for your company.

We begin our coverage in Mariupol, Ukraine, and the evacuation on Friday of at least 50 civilians from that besieged steel factory. Two buses said to have carried some of the evacuees were seen arriving in the town east of Mariupol under Russian military escort. It is not known where they were taken, nor how many remain at the plant.

The building has been under constant bombardment from Russian tanks, artillery and aircraft. President Zelenskyy says that he is pursuing negotiations for a safe evacuation of the soldiers still inside.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We are also working on diplomatic options to save our military who remain in Azovstal. Influential mediators are involved, including influential states.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HOLMES: Monday marks victory day in Russia, commemorating the Nazi surrender in World War II. Russia hastily putting its stamp on wherever it can in Mariupol. A Russian flag flies above a city hospital. Road signs have been changed to Russian. An adviser to the mayor says Soviet-era statues are popping up around the city.

Meanwhile, the U.S. President Joe Biden announcing $150 million in additional military aid but warning that the U.S. is running low on what it can send, without additional approval from Congress. Let's send it over to Lviv in Ukraine, that is where we find our Isa Soares.

Good morning to you, Isa. ISA SOARES, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: A very good morning to you, Michael, as you correctly noted there, Monday's victory day in Russia. It is an important anniversary marking the end of the Second World War In Europe.

Over the years, by the way, Putin has used it as a show of strength and military hardware. It appears that Moscow may try to make a show of the city of Mariupol, what is left of it, as well as other places it controls. Our Nick Paton Walsh is in southern Ukraine and has the very latest for you.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR (voice-over): Escorted by armor, curtains closed, inside are said to be some of the latest civilians to evacuate the unbridled hell of Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. Yet these are Russian troops escorting them out, not the United Nations who helped evacuate earlier in the week.

Ukrainian soldiers here Friday said one of theirs died and six were injured in an evacuation bid.

And while Ukraine said it began a new operation to get people out from under this, the savagery of Russian bombardment at the factory, the U.N. said Friday, a total of 500 people had got out since their efforts began this weekend. Many, many more desperate to flee.

Battered and uninhabitable as much of Mariupol is, still ahead of Monday's Victory Day, it appears the city's drama theater, its basement packed with children when it was bombed by Russia killing hundreds is now being cleared up, excavated.

These satellite images first on CNN, showing rubble visible in April gone in recent days. Vehicles lined up and the ground around the theater cleared to make it more presentable. It's not clear why they are tidying the scene of what many called a war crime.

The warped world of what Russia calls liberation was also on view here in these rare images filmed inside a filtration camp where Ukrainians are held before being forced to go to Russia.

Passports taken, sleeping on the floor or in chairs, illness from the cold, all part of the experience of liberation, according to one woman whose father was there.

And this staged visit, evidence of Russia's rush to assimilate what it has clumsily torn off Ukraine.

[00:05:00]

WALSH (voice-over): This is Kherson, the first city it captured and the man in the beard is Denis Pushilin, separatist leader from Donetsk in the visit suggesting Kherson under Russian occupation where protests are crushed will also be declared a tin pot People's Republic soon.

It all has the whiff of empire.

Here, he sits discussing transferring food from Kherson to Russia's separatist areas, watermelons and tomatoes. He might call it trade, Ukraine a food heist.

But Moscow is far from having its way and the costs are heavy. These images CNN has confirmed were filmed in a graveyard in Ryazan, the flags of the Russian Paratroop Division, the elite and there are many just in this one city.

These are the dead behind the propaganda, with so much rubble in Russia's tiny victories -- Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, southern Ukraine.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

SOARES: Apparent evidence of Russian atrocities and war crimes are everywhere across Ukraine's battered landscape. On Friday, President Zelenskyy says he thinks the Kremlin believes it can escape prosecution by blackmailing Europe with nuclear weapons. Prosecuting war crimes is the expertise of David Scheffer, who is the former U.S. ambassador for war crimes at the U.S. State Department.

David, a very good evening to you. Look, what I have been hearing on the ground here is truly horrific. It is fair to say, accounts of atrocities being committed by Russian forces. Only two days ago the Ukraine prosecuting general says that the Russian army admitted that some 9,800 crimes in 70 days.

From what you have seen, what you have heard, is there evidence here of possible war crimes?

DAVID SCHEFFER, SENIOR FELLOW, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS: Yes, there most certainly is. There is a massive investigative effort taking place on the ground in Ukraine, not only by investigators at the International Criminal Court but also by various countries, including the United States, the European Union countries, civil societies.

This is probably the most significant investigative initiative of atrocity crimes in history. in this period of time. There has not been another conflict where investigators have landed on the ground and begun to investigate atrocities crimes as quickly and as thoroughly as in this situation.

I think we need to distinguish here that it is fairly obvious that the Russian military as an organization is committing war crimes in Russia. The next step, of course, if you want to prosecute individuals in a courtroom, is that you have to prove an individual case of a war crime against an individual.

That is the heavy lift of investigative work. But I do not think that we need to complicate too much whether or not we are witnessing war crimes. Ukraine is the largest crime scene in the world today.

It is unprecedented how the Russian military has destroyed civilian structures in Ukraine, how has routed the people of Ukraine in massive refugee flows. Essentially the Russian military has become a criminal organization.

It is demonstrating that, on such a large level of assault on the civilian population, that the laymen of the world can see it for what it is. It is atrocity crimes, war crimes, crimes against humanity, which means an assault against a civilian population of a country.

We sometimes see some of the red lines of the Genocide Act being approached in Ukraine, so it is before us. And the media is doing an enormous job to bring it to everyone's attention.

SOARES: I have spoken to those investigating war crimes with the U.N., with the E.U. and we have also heard from the prosecutor here, just in the last few weeks, in fact.

Talk us through what you hinted at there, the kind of challenges of verifying and recording that these crimes have, indeed, occurred?

SCHEFFER: I would suggest that there are two levels to look at. One is the individual war crime on the ground, where there has been a missile hit or an artillery firing on a civilian settlement or a mass rape situation in the town. Those are individual crimes.

[00:10:00]

SCHEFFER: We know that individual soldiers for the Russian military are engaged in those crimes. The issue is how to identify them.

You do that through witness statements of the victims, you do that by looking through the clothes of dead Russian military soldiers to understand who has been the commander, what unit are they in.

You do a plan of battle analysis, where you need military analysts to understand how the military came into a particular town on a particular day and what they did in that town on that day. Those are highly detailed investigations. They take time.

But the prosecutor general of the Ukraine is doing an enormous job in trying to bring this together. There may be an issue of how all this is being coordinated between international and national prosecutions, that we have to keep working hard at because we don't want to conduct multiple interviews with the same victim.

That is not fair to the victim. So you have to be very careful about who is interviewing whom, what are the protocols of those interviews, how is that evidence then collected and forwarded to the appropriate tribunal, domestic court, et cetera.

There is a great complexity. But I'd also add that the crime impression is a leadership crime. For the crime in progression, you are not dealing with all those little crimes on the ground. You are looking at the leadership of Russia, why or how did they actually launch this invasion, which is a crime of aggression.

It is under the umbrella of a crime of aggression that all these other crimes take place. Frankly, every single military action by the Russian military on Ukrainian territory is criminal in character, because it was implemented under the umbrella of a massive crime, which is the crime of aggression.

SOARES: Clearly, the point that you made very clearly there is that it is not just about prosecuting those officers, the military, that are conducting, had their hands in these were crimes but the country itself, I think that is important.

David, always great to have your thoughts, I am sorry to leave it there, I can speak to you for hours here. Really appreciate it. Thank you, David.

And Michael, this is what we have been hearing. We heard from the prosecutor general here, from the U.N.; two days ago, I heard from the E.U. It is a huge investigation by all these different bodies really trying to verify everything that is happening, keeping them on the record.

You heard from David, clearly, it is taking them to the next level, taking them to International Criminal Court and making sure, of course, that it is not just individuals but also the country that faces the charges. Michael.

HOLMES: The challenge always is proving it up the line, up the chain of command, how high can they find culpability?

That is always a difficult thing. But it is an important conversation and fascinating interview, Isa, thank you so much. We'll check in with you the next hour.

We will now show you the war in Ukraine from an entirely different perspective. It involves a ground battle recorded in real time by a Russian military drone. The footage released by Pro Kremlin, a media outlet. As Salma Abdelaziz reports for us now, the video shows how important drones have become on Ukrainian battlefields.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is drone warfare as Russia wants you to see it, Moscow's troops hunting down Ukrainian defenders in the town of Popasna, backed by surveillance from the skies.

We sat down with a military expert to parse through the 22 minutes of aerial footage released by Pro Kremlin channels.

ABDELAZIZ: What am I looking at here, this column?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are Russian forces there. The first soldiers moved into the trench to clear that trench.

ABDELAZIZ: Then we see that Ukrainian soldier popping out of that shed, over and over again.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Small arms fire taking place now. He's essentially pinned in that location. Whoever is on the drone will be speaking to the soldiers on the ground. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): This is close and intense combat with limited visibility. The Russian fighters here depend on the drone operator for a bird's-eye view and real-time intelligence.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You see him toss another grenade. This time he will be a little bit closer. He's done it properly this time. The fact that grenades did not kill him, I would be particularly surprised if he survived.

ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): Now watch this part carefully. The video cuts. We are still looking at the same location.

[00:15:00]

ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): But now there are at least six captured men on the ground, reportedly Ukrainian defenders.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We can see the Russian soldiers that are marked with the white armbands and white legbands. We have a series of soldiers that appear to be prisoners, on the ground. We don't know where the soldiers have come from.

ABDELAZIZ: What is the plan for these guys?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They have been told to take off their body armor. They have been stripped of their fighting capability immediately.

We have here a Russian soldier that looks like he is giving physical abuse to a prisoner of war that's on the ground just out of sight. They're looking for individuals of interest. They're looking for individuals of intelligence interest. And they will get taken away for questioning.

ABDELAZIZ: You can see him kicking that man.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, that's quite normal. But it's interesting where they are going to next. It's a bit crowded in a prisoner of war pen. And within that pen, they will get searched in more detail, they will get questioned. And then they will go back to a centralized prison system.

ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): The Ukrainian military's effective use of Turkish made drones helped it beat back Russian troops around Kyiv and other areas. Now the Kremlin wants the world to believe that it is capable of the same success.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What we are witnessing is that the Russians are being much slower to pick up the use of tactical drones than Ukrainians are.

ABDELAZIZ: Are you saying the message here is, look, we are really good at using drones too?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I believe it is. We also have propaganda material. This is effectively staged propaganda material. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): It's unclear when the footage was shot. But Russian troops are now largely in control of what is left of Popasna. And that's the other Kremlin tactic on display here: scorched Earth on the eastern flank.

Ukrainian troops have largely stood their ground, retreating if possible, surrendering when no options are left -- Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London.

HOLMES: Nearly 2 dozen people are dead after a massive explosion ripped through an iconic hotel in Cuba. Now rescue workers are combing through the rubble, searching for survivors. We will have the latest from Havana when we come back.

HOLMES: At least 22 people are dead following an enormous explosion in the Cuban capital, Havana. Officials say that a gas leak is thought to be the cause of the blast, which happened at the historic Hotel Saratoga.

Dozens of people, including children, have been hospitalized. Police and firefighters combing through what is left of the destroyed building, trying to find survivors. Patrick Oppmann has the latest from Havana.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Rescue workers continued their grim task of sifting through massive amounts of rubble of what used to be the iconic five-star Hotel Saratoga, after an explosion ripped through the hotel early on Friday.

I'm told by Cuban officials is that a gas truck had arrived, gas for the hotel users for cooking. I am told that workers were ready to reopen the hotel to tourists next weekend. And somehow, as the gas was being delivered to the hotel, a leak apparently caused the hotel to fill up full of gas.

And that led to a massive explosion that has gutted the hotel. We arrived moments after the explosion, with some people being taken from the rubble and one woman barely able to walk. There was another woman covered in blood, obviously seriously injured, being taken away in a stretcher.

Rescue workers used their bare hands to try to claw away the rubble and see if there was anyone inside. Cuban president Miguel Diaz-Canel said that there was no sign of intentional terrorism that took place here but that a investigation would take place.

As the light goes out here, as the day ends, rescue workers say they will continue the difficult task of trying to look for any survivors, recover bodies. There is concern this building has been damaged so terribly that it could give way. So they are proceeding very cautiously.

But they say they will not stop until everyone is accounted for -- Patrick Oppmann, CNN, Havana.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

HOLMES: China is reporting more than 4,600 new cases of COVID. The majority of local cases were reported in the hardhit city of Shanghai. Once again, Beijing is also reporting over 50 new local cases.

Local officials say that more than 20 million of the capital's residents will also have to undergo three more rounds of mass PCR testing, to be held daily from Saturday through Monday.

In the United States, rising COVID cases aren't the only worry for health experts. The Centers for Disease Control is investigating more than 100 cases of severe, unexplained hepatitis in children.

Authorities say that the cases appear to be rare and that officials have not seen an increase in liver inflammation of children coming into emergency rooms. And they added that the cases appear to be linked to an adenovirus, that isn't known to cause hepatitis in otherwise healthy children.

CDC officials say they are considering a range of possible causes, including exposure to animals.

Emmanuel Macron is just hours away from being formally inaugurated as president of France for a second term. The ceremony will take place at the Elysee Palace in Paris. President Macron will sign official documents, be recognized as a grand master of the Legion of Honour and deliver a speech.

[00:25:00]

HOLMES: In the runoff election last month, Macron defeated far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.

As the U.K. gears up to celebrate Queen Elizabeth's platinum jubilee on June the 2nd, we are learning that Prince Harry, Meghan and Prince Andrew will not join the royals on the famous Buckingham Palace balcony. That is because tradition dictates that only working royals will make an appearance.

But the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said they will attend the surrounding festivities. It is unclear if the queen herself will even be there. Some of her appearances were canceled in the last few months due to her health and mobility. Sources told CNN that that will be decided nearer the time. I am Michael Holmes, thanks for spending part of your day with me. "CONNECTING AFRICA" is up next for our international viewers. For those in North America, I will be back with more news after the break.

HOLMES: Welcome back. I'm Michael Holmes. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.

Now more evacuations are planned in the coming day from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, where the last Ukrainian defenders have been holed up for weeks now, along with civilians, too, of course. About 50 civilians were rescued on Friday.

The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying he's working on diplomatic options in the hopes of getting soldiers out safely as well.

Meanwhile, Soviet-era statues and Russian flags have been popping up in that port city ahead of Russia's victory day holiday on Monday. The day marks the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.

And Western officials think Vladimir Putin could use the occasion to make a major announcement that he would escalate the conflict.

All of this as satellite images show Russia excavating the Mariupol theater, which was bombed back in March. The Ukrainian officials are saying that 300 people who were taking shelter inside were killed.

Now this was hit by an apparent Russian strike, despite the words "children" written in large letters outside. Russia has denied responsibility.

Now for the first time since this war began, the U.N. Security Council has managed to get on the same page on Ukraine.

On Friday, the council releasing its first joint statement since the start of the conflict, saying it is deeply concerned about peace and security in Ukraine and that it supports efforts by the secretary general, Antonio Guterres, to find a peaceful solution.

The council has been unable to speak in one voice or do anything really to stop the war, partly because, of course, Russia has veto power in the chamber.

Meanwhile, the woman believed to be Vladimir Putin's girlfriend may soon be targeted by E.U. sanctions. European diplomatic sources tell CNN that Alina Kabaeva has been included in the latest proposed measures. Jim Bittermann with more on what we know about her and the push to punish those close to Putin. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Putin's punishment for the war hitting his most inner circle, the E.U.'s prime target, Alina Kabaeva, who is said to be Putin's girlfriend and believed to have been given control over much of Putin's wealth and property.

The two have been rumored to be in a romantic relationship ever since Putin appeared to take an unusual interest in Kabaeva, 30 years his junior, after she won a gold Olympic medal for Russia in rhythmic gymnastics in 2004.

A few years later, rumors began to circulate that Putin was separating from his wife, which the Kremlin vehemently denied but which were confirmed in 2014 when the couple officially divorced after 30 years of marriage.

Meanwhile, Kabaeva rose steadily in Russian political circles, becoming a deputy in parliament from Putin's party, in a post she held for six years before moving on to control a pro Putin media group.

For some time now, there have been calls from supporters of Ukraine to sanction Kabaeva. But Washington was reported to be reluctant to go after someone so close to the Russian president for fear of taking another step toward escalating the conflict. Late last month, though, the White House appeared to say no change in approach.

JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: No one is safe from our sanctions. We've already, of course, sanction President Putin but also his daughter, his closest cronies and will continue to review more.

BITTERMAN (voice-over): And among the more another close confidant of Putin, the Patriarch Kirill, the prelate of the Russian Orthodox Church, who is said to have wealth far beyond the average church leader.

He has strongly supported when he called in a sermon, Putin's special peacekeeping operation, which he added was a religious cleansing operation to liberate Russian speakers in Ukraine.

He's so close to Putin, that in a highly unusual comment from the Vatican, Pope Francis said of Kirill, the patriarch cannot become Putin's altar boy, something that threatened to put the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches further at odds.

There are a number of other targets in the E.U. sanctions, including a promise to wean Europeans off Russian gas and oil by the end of this year. But several countries are already demanding exceptions to that because of their heavy reliance on Russian energy -- Jim Bittermann, CNN, Paris.

HOLMES: Italy, meanwhile, has seized a super yacht believed to be connected to Russia. [00:35:00]

HOLMES: Italian authorities say the owner of the Scheherazade is linked to, quote, "prominent elements" of the Russian government. The vessel has been under scrutiny since March for possible connections to Vladimir Putin. The super yacht is said to be worth about $700 million.

HOLMES: Shock and fury have erupted over the U.S. Supreme Court's likely plans to end federal abortion rights.

So how do Americans feel about overturning the landmark case Roe v. Wade?

Well, it turns out most are against the idea.

[00:40:00]

HOLMES: According to a new CNN poll following the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion, 66 percent of Americans say Roe v. Wade should not be struck down.

The 1973 decision has provided constitutional protections for those seeking an abortion for nearly half a century. Many states across the U.S. are already preparing anti-abortion legislation to be ready if and perhaps when the Supreme Court decides to overturn Roe v. Wade. CNN's Jessica Schneider reports.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

GOV. KEVIN STITT (R-OK): We want to outlaw abortion in the state of Oklahoma.

JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Nearly two dozen states are on the brink of banning abortion and it will happen almost immediately if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade.

Thirteen states have trigger laws, abortion bans that will go into effect once Roe is off the books. Nine states have so-called zombie laws, abortion bans that were never repealed once Roe took effect in 1973. These bans would go back into effect if the conservatives on the court eliminate that constitutional right to abortion.

DANA NESSEL (D-MI), ATTORNEY GENERAL: That very moment, prosecutors around the state, could begin prosecuting doctors and I would argue, potentially women as well.

SCHNEIDER: Michigan's law makes no exception for rape or incest but it would allow abortions to save the mother's life. But the Republican running for attorney general in Michigan says he would prosecute even if abortion was performed in an effort to save the mother.

MATT DEPERNO (R), CANDIDATE FOR MICHIGAN ATTORNEY GENERAL: And then said, well, what about the life of the mother, OK. Do you have an exception for that?

I said, I do not. Because there is literally no medical diagnosis that says that if the mother's life is in danger, abort the baby.

SCHNEIDER: That is just one example of how uncertain the actual enforcement of criminal abortion statutes could be. In Wisconsin, the attorney general is already saying he'll refuse to prosecute and will instead leave it to local district attorneys.

JOSH KAUL (D-WI), ATTORNEY GENERAL: It's my view that we have problems that we need our law enforcement to be dealing with, like violent crime, drug trafficking. And we don't need to shift their focus from -- from those important efforts to -- to going after people for allegedly violating a ban that nobody had understood to be enforceable for almost 50 years.

SCHNEIDER: The wide-ranging prosecutorial approach reflects just how uncertain and uneven the legal landscape would be in a post-Roe world.

MARY ZIEGLER, VISITING PROFESSOR, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL: I think the most important and difficult question is going to be the, whether states can reach out of their own borders to prosecute people or whether states are going to prosecute patients for having abortions as Louisiana seems to be doing.

SCHNEIDER: Louisiana lawmakers passed a bill out of committee this week that would classify abortions as homicides, leaving the door open for patients to be prosecuted. And then there's the question about how officials would even find out about illegal abortions.

Privacy advocates are now raising the alarm that people's Google searches could be used against them or even their own cell phones. Alan Butler leads the Electronic Privacy Information Center and points out that third parties can buy data from Google and perform reverse searches that could enable law enforcement to track who was at an abortion clinic and when.

ALAN BUTLER, ELECTRONIC PRIVACY INFORMATION CENTER: If the prosecutor goes and gets a court order to get this type of data or they go and try to buy this data on the open market, for example, which is another thing that happens, then they would know the information about the devices that were there, the ID of your device.

SCHNEIDER: Legal experts are now scrambling to fully understand all the implications of a post-Roe America. And many say rather than the Supreme Court's likely decision being the final word, it could instead spur a flurry of state-by-state legal fights in the years ahead -- Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington.

HOLMES: A federal judge has dismissed Donald Trump's lawsuit against Twitter. The former president is trying to reinstate his banned account from the social media platform. That's according to a court filing.

The judge says that Twitter was not acting as an agent of the U.S. government when it shut down the account, as Trump alleged. Therefore it was not infringing on his First Amendment rights to free speech. The decision is a victory for Twitter, which had asked the judge to toss out the suit.

Now we're learning more information about the manhunt for an Alabama inmate and corrections officer, who went missing more than a week ago. The U.S. Marshal Service says this SUV was found in a tow lot in Tennessee just a couple of hours north of Florence, Alabama, where the investigation began.

Investigators believe it was the getaway car used by Vicky White. They also released these pictures of the suspect, showing what they might look like with altered appearances. Escaped inmate Casey White has easily identified tattoos that you can see there.

RAFAEL NADAL is a member of the ATP Player Council which has been involved in determining punishments for Wimbledon over their ban on Russians.

Rafael Nadal has refused to disclose the ATP Player Council’s decision on any sanctions for Wimbledon after the tournament banned Russian and Belarusian players. It comes after Nadal and Roger Federer were told to “come clean” over their role in the ATP’s plans to penalise Wimbledon as the men’s tour holds meetings in Rome.

Nadal is one of the players on the 10-man ATP Player Council, who have been holding meetings in Rome and Madrid to determine the sanctions on Wimbledon and the Lawn Tennis Association for banning Russian and Belarusian players from this year’s Grand Slam and the grass-court warm-up tournaments. A decision could be announced as early as Wednesday with a vote potentially taking place in today’s meeting in Rome.

The men’s tour looks set to strip all ranking points from Wimbledon, turning it into a glorified exhibition, but the two-time former champion in SW19 refused to disclose the council’s decision on Wednesday. “I don't have a clear opinion on the matter and I don't want to declare anything,” he said after his win over John Isner at the Italian Open.

“We have to stay in touch with Wimbledon and protect all ATP and WTA players and play for the benefit of all players." His comments come after Chris Bryant MP, the chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Russia, told The Telegraph that both Nadal and Federer needed to “come clean” over their involvement in the sanctions on Wimbledon as Player Council members.

“Do they want Vladimir Putin to fail or don’t they care?” he added. The least the ATP will do is freeze the rankings and points of Russian and Belarusian players unable to compete in Wimbledon, so they do not suffer a drop-off as a result of the ban. But the 21-time Major champion did not want to talk about the decision while competing in Rome, with Wimbledon almost two months away.

However, Nadal did admit that the council’s final verdict wouldn’t make everyone happy as he added: “I am in Rome, Wimbledon is several weeks away. We work to defend all the players. Nothing will benefit everyone and nothing is perfect, not everyone will like the final decision.”

Some have pointed out that stripping all points from the tournament would affect those who were able to compete, with a points freeze the better option to protect Russian and Belarusian players without hindering the others. With Nadal noting the council wanted to “defend all players”, it could indicate a freeze to ensure others weren’t left without points for competing at The Championships.

The ATP has also been hoping to make a decision in tandem with the WTA but the women’s tour is yet to confirm whether they are also looking to remove all ranking points from Wimbledon. It could leave the tournament in a unique position that would see the men’s singles and doubles players unable to earn points while the women would still be able to build on their ranking.

Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has proposed the creation of a new cartel of oil consumers to make markets more favourable to Western buyers.The post Italy floats creation of new cartel to meet European interests appeared first on CityAM.

Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has proposed the creation of a new cartel of oil consumers to make markets more favourable to Western buyers.

He floated the idea following a meeting with US President Joe Biden, which included talk on reforming global energy markets after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking to reporters in Washington, he revealed that both leaders discussed the “general concept” of capping prices for oil and gas.

“We are both dissatisfied with the way things work, in terms of oil for the US and in terms of gas for Europe. Prices don’t have any relationship with supply and demand,” he said.

Draghi argued Europe should make use of its “market power”, and suggested his country’s priority would be to limit commodity prices to “reduce the financial help we are giving to Putin to continue the war.”

The world’s leading oil cartel, the Organisation for Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+), has persistently failed to reach its pledged modest increases in oil output this year.

Despite committing to an extra 432,000 plus barrels per day this month, multiple members have missed their production quotas amid both capacity issues and concerns over a potential supply glut due to continued geopolitical volatility.

Calls from the West to boost supplies have fallen on deaf ears, with tight markets underpinning rallies in March which saw oil prices peak at a 14-year high of $139 per barrel.

Later moves from the US and the International Energy Agency to pledge a combined release of 240m barrels cooled prices, which still remain historically elevated over the $100 milestone.

EU remains split over sanction proposals

Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the European Union (EU) has spent nearly €50bn on Kremlin-backed fossil fuels, considerably more than the aid it has provided to Kyiv.

The trading bloc’s executive branch, the European Commission, is aiming to push through proposals for the EU to phase out Russian oil supplies over the next six months – although Hungary is still withholding support for the measure.

While the EU could bring in restrictions for Russian oil imports – which it relies on for 25 per cent of its crude supplies – the group has shown no sign of bringing in restrictions on Russian gas flows.

Multiple European companies have reportedly caved in to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s demands for Russian gas to be paid in roubles, and Draghi said he was confident the Kremlin’s demand that European buyers pay for Russian gas in roubles will not lead to a disruption of supplies.

The European Commission has warned that complying with Russia’s scheme might breach EU sanctions, but Draghi said it was a “grey zone” with no official ruling on the matter.

He explained: “There is no official pronouncement of what it means to breach sanctions, nobody has ever said anything about whether roubles payments breach sanctions or not, how these payments are organised, so it’s such a grey zone here.”

Italy relies on Russia for 40 per cent of its gas imports – in line with the EU average – but has been urgently seeking to find alternative suppliers.

Brit tennis pro slams ATP and WTA Player Councils for 'voting for no points' at Wimbledon

THE ATP and WTA Tours are moving to strip Wimbledon of its ranking points over the ban on Russian and Belarusian players.

he ATP and WTA Player Councils have been slammed for allegedly voting through a decision to strip Wimbledon of its ranking points in response to the tournament’s ban on Russian and Belarusian players. British doubles world No 89 Tara Moore claimed the WTA Player Council had failed to consult any of their fellow players on the women’s tour before making the decision.

There has been speculation for weeks that the ATP and WTA Tours would remove all ranking points on offer at Wimbledon as a sanction on the tournament for imposing a ban on all Russians and Belarusians from competing at The Championships this summer. Both tours held meetings in Madrid and Rome, with the ATP said to be close to revealing its decision.

But according to a British pro, both tours have already voted in favour of removing all ranking points from the grass-court Grand Slam without consulting players outside of the council, causing outrage. “Can someone explain to me how the WTA player council has voted for NO POINTS to be given at WIMBLEDON and no player outside the council was even consulted?!?!” she wrote in an Instagram story.

The 29-year-old also shared a screenshot of her story on Twitter, adding: “Also the ATP players council has voted this through too.” Former ATP world No 64 Dustin Brown shared her post and was also unhappy with the outcome, writing: “Why Can It Be Done Now, But When Covid Started & This Discussion Was Had About US Open & No Points , It Was Said It Cant Be Done Cause Of TV Deals etc.”

Both the ATP and WTA were expected to sanction Wimbledon and the LTA after all Russian and Belarusian players were banned from the Grand Slam as well as all British grass-court events, and at the very least were going to freeze the ranking points of affected players to prevent them dropping down the rankings while being prevented from playing.

Rafael Nadal, a member of the ATP Player Council, told reporters that some things were “not good to go public” when asked about the council’s decision earlier in the week as meetings continued. “The only thing that we can do is be in touch with Wimbledon and with the rest of the ATP management to do the things that works better to protect every single player in the ATP,” he said.

“In the end that’s our job, to protect the players and to work in the benefit of every single player that we are representing. That’s all. The rest of the things, I am not able to talk about.” The Spaniard’s emphasis on the councils representing all players hinted that it could be a ranking freeze on those affected to ensure those who could still compete at Wimbledon would be rewarded, but according to Moore this is not the case.

Both the ATP and WTA Tours are yet to confirm the sanctions on Wimbledon officially, while the LTA has been forced to postpone the entry deadlines for some of its tournaments as they await a final decision on ranking points from the tours.

Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra became the winner of the LXVI edition of the Eurovision Song Contest 2022, which was held in Turin, Italy,on Saturday.

Ukraine received all 12 points, the highest rating, from its neighboring countries: Poland, Romania and Moldova, plus Latvia. But the big leap that took it to first place was the public vote, which gave it 439 votes, for a total of 631.

It was followed by the United Kingdom, with 466 votes, and Spain, with 459 votes, thanks to the performance of singer Chanel, who achieved the best position for her country in 27 years.

This is the third time Ukraine has triumphed at the European music festival, after winning in 2004 and 2016. After the award ceremony, the vocalist of the Ukrainian band, Oleh Psiuk, dedicated the triumph to all the citizens of his country and shouted, "Glory to Ukraine!".

Earlier, at the culmination of his performance Psiuk had cried out for support for Ukraine in the face of the aggression they are suffering. "Help for Ukraine, help for Mariupol, help for Azovstal, now!" he said.

During the ceremony, which was not attended by Russia because it was suspended as a sanction for the invasion ordered by Vladimir Putin's regime, there were various messages in support of the Ukrainians.

The singers of the Icelandic band Systur showed their support for Ukraine by wearing stickers with the Ukrainian flag on their guitars and hands.

Meanwhile, Monika Liu from Lithuania pointed to the Ukrainian flag, asking people to vote for Ukraine, when the voting was opened to the public.

Oligarchs lose an Italian paradise

ROMAZZINO, Italy - Even among the billionaires who flock to this vacation enclave, the Russian oligarchs stood out.

They bought up the choicest villas along the coast, building de facto empires shielded behind clipped hedges and surveillance cameras. They were known among real estate agents for always wanting armed guards. One mining and metals tycoon, Alisher Usmanov, would announce his presence every summer with the arrival of one of the world's largest yachts, which he'd park in the turquoise bay, shuttling between the vessel and his villas, flying in guests on helicopters.

"It was like having an oligarch state right here in Sardinia," said Mauro Pili, a journalist who was once this island's governor.

That state has now been dismantled.

Over the past two months, European sanctions targeting wealthy elites with Kremlin connections have leveled a direct strike on this lavish northeastern stretch of Sardinia known as the Emerald Coast. At least eight villas spread out across 10 miles have been frozen by the Italian government, leaving the targeted oligarchs - three Russian billionaires - cut off from the secluded coves and crescent-moon beaches.

But the move to strip Russians of their European property and privileges leaves several dilemmas in its wake.

Hundreds of workers - sometimes receiving five- and six-figure tips - are out of a job. Sardinians are left to wrestle with whether they miscalculated in catering to Moscow's super-rich; some developers even had websites in Russian. Then there is the biggest headache of all: figuring out how to manage the frozen properties - more than $250 million in real estate, all now in the hands of the Italian state, with no clear answer on how long they might sit empty.

"They'll be like haunted mansions," said Tamara Grilloti, a luxury real estate agent in Sardinia.

The villas are scarcely visible from behind their front gates. The views encompass rocky headlands, sea and sky. The Emerald Coast is less developed than Mykonos or Ibiza. And it springs to life only for a few weeks a year, when the ultrarich arrive in July and August, private planes touching down by the hundreds.

Visitors have included George Clooney, Bill Gates, hedge fund managers and supermodels. On at least two occasions, in 2003 and 2008, Russian President Vladimir Putin stayed as a guest at the palatial compound of then-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Among Russians, those trips helped boost the popularity of Sardinia, which is 100 miles across the Tyrrhenian Sea from Rome - and nearly 2,000 miles from Moscow.

According to the Italian government, the Russians with frozen property here include Alexei Mordashov, a steel magnate said to be Russia's richest man, and Dmitry Mazepin, who until March was the chief executive and controlling owner of fertilizer company Uralchem, and who held the Sardinian property in tandem with his son.

Among locals, though, the most well-known of the targeted oligarchs is Usmanov, who unlike the other billionaires spent months, not just weeks, in Sardinia each year, and who ingratiated himself to the year-round community that tends to live more inland.

Usmanov, 68, started coming to Sardinia soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and, as he assembled a constellation of properties, he developed a reputation for being generous with his riches.

He bought several ambulances for the municipality. He sponsored the local soccer team. He funded cultural activities. He also spent much of Italy's coronavirus lockdown in Sardinia - providing an economic boost when tourism slowed.

In 2018, when the community named him an honorary citizen, Usmanov spoke at the local town hall about how Sardinia's geography reminded him of the area of Uzbekistan where he grew up.

"[There is] a certain chemistry between my soul and this land," Usmanov said.

Sardinians are now trying to reconcile what they saw with what Western governments are saying about his role in the war.

The United States says Usmanov is one of the elites whose wealth - accumulated through metals, mining, IT and telecommunications - is allowing Putin to sustain his assault on Ukraine. The European Union says Usmanov has been called one of Putin's "favorite oligarchs," has fronted money for the Russian leader and has "solved his business problems."

Usmanov controls a daily newspaper, the Kommersant, whose entire political desk resigned in 2019 as he curtailed editorial freedoms and instituted a pro-Kremlin line.

Usmanov also used the villas in Sardinia for treating Russian elites. One former employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he had signed a nondisclosure agreement, recalled Usmanov more than a decade ago introducing him to one of the guests aboard a yacht. "This man will be president one day," the former employee remembers Usmanov saying. It was Dmitry Medvedev, who served by turns as Russia's president and prime minister from 2008 until 2020.

Amid the sanctions, Usmanov has lost access to assets European governments say he controlled. France has impounded two helicopters, and German officials in Hamburg have frozen a $600 million yacht, outfitted with two helipads and an 80-foot swimming pool.

Many Sardinians still hope Usmanov might ultimately be able to come back to the island. They tend to see the war as Putin's alone, and don't view Usmanov, or other oligarchs without military and security roles, as being complicit in the invasion. The town of Arzachena, for instance, has not revoked Usmanov's citizenship honors.

"Many of these oligarchs are still perceived here as magnates, as benefactors," said Mirko Idili, a union leader. He said he is trying to broker a deal between the Italian government and Usmanov to protect the workers, some of whom have lost their jobs, and others whose jobs have been suspended without pay.

But Pili, the former governor, said Sardinia now has a chance to wean itself from reliance on Russian wealth. He compared the opportunity to the decision facing European countries on whether to continue buying Russian oil and gas.

"We ended up relying fundamentally on one world," he said. "And once you close the tap, there's damage."

Keeping up with the Usmanovs

Four Usmanov-linked villas are clustered on a tiny peninsula, where the properties slope down toward the beach, nestled among cactus paddles and flowers. They are among the most exclusive properties in Sardinia. And the job of attending to them now falls to the Italian government, which is required by law to maintain the value of any asset it freezes.

Real estate agents and owners say that even outside the context of sanctions, villas like these can be as vexing as they are alluring. They cost several hundred thousand dollars annually to operate - and that's just the beginning. Workers, sometimes commuting as far as an hour away, are hard to come by, especially for employers who aren't willing to pay as well as the Russians did. Across the Emerald Coast this month, many villas - weeks away from the summer surge - looked more like construction sites.

"When you arrive the first day of the summer, it's always a disaster," said Flavio Briatore, an Italian entrepreneur who has a home on the island and who owns a nearby restaurant and dance club called the Billionaire. "Some pump isn't working, whatever. And then when everything is finally ready to go, it's time to go back [home]."

"Sooner or later I want to sell mine," he said.

As an example of what it takes to manage an ultraluxury property, one typical morning this month, 20 workers were scattered across the grounds of a villa belonging to Ezio Simonelli, an Italian tax accountant. One man was retouching the bottom of a swimming pool - one of three on a property that has been rented in the past by George Clooney and the then-president of Kazakhstan. Six workers were pulling up rotted wood from around a hot tub. Yet more were attending to the various other needs of the property, which includes a vegetable garden, a tennis court, two golf holes, a wine cellar, and an industrial-sized kitchen that can cater parties of up to 350 guests.

"Look at this wood; it's like dust," one of the workers said, digging up some broken planks.

Italy doesn't have to keep the frozen villas guest-ready, but by law it is supposed to keep them from falling apart. People familiar with the work, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue, say the government faces a monumental task.

Italy has on its hands not just the Emerald Coast villas, but another in Sardinia, 40 minutes by car, linked to Petr Aven, until recently the head of Russia's largest commercial bank. There is also a frozen villa in Tuscany and several others near Lake Como. That's in addition to two of the world's most expensive yachts, which tend to have annual operating costs in the millions.

And that is probably not the full list of assets in Italy controlled by Russians targeted by sanctions. Several real estate agents connect another Emerald Coast property to industrialist Oleg Deripaska, who is under sanction. No property belonging to Deripaska is on Italy's list of frozen assets, and the Finance Ministry declined to comment on specific cases.

In theory, Italy can use the oligarchs' frozen bank accounts to help pay for the upkeep of the frozen villas and yachts. But one person with knowledge of the Russian cases said the maintenance costs will exceed the money in the accounts.

Clara Portela, a specialist in international sanctions at the University of Valencia, said E.U. countries have scant experience in handling mega-assets; most of the people previously targeted by E.U. measures - such as members of Myanmar's junta - didn't have significant wealth stored away in Europe.

"These were individuals that didn't have such a glamorous lifestyle," Portela said.

On the street with the Usmanov-linked villas, there is no sign that Italy has yet begun its work, and the agency responsible for the frozen assets says it is still finalizing how to manage the properties.

"The Italian state has to make a decision," said Grilloti, a real estate agent who previously rented properties to Russians. "If it were up to me, I'd put them up for rent, and give the money to Ukraine."

Italy says it has the option to sell the frozen assets if they become too expensive to manage. But such a move would be likely to draw legal challenges.

Already, Usmanov has pledged to use "all legal means" to protect his reputation. And there have been successful challenges to European sanctions over the past decade-plus, including on due-process grounds.

In a statement, Usmanov's spokesman said he would not comment on any possible legal steps. But he said Usmanov considers the sanctions to be "unfair and based on false and defamatory allegations." The statement said that most of the properties in Europe that have been connected to him were in fact long ago "transferred into irrevocable family trusts."

Sardinia represents life before the war

While the Russians own many of the Emerald Coast's top properties - "like diamonds," said the head of the land- and homeowners association - they represent only a minority of Sardinia's jet-set class. In the summer, villas also fill up with Germans and Swiss and Italians, and many others from the Persian Gulf. There are even some Ukrainians - though they, too, are now finding themselves cut off, not because of sanctions but because of the war.

"It's not that the Russians broke down my plans for vacation," said Aleksandr Nastenko, 50, the owner of a geological company. "They destroyed my life."

Most summers, Nastenko rents a villa in Sardinia - far smaller than the Russian ones. But earlier this month, he was instead standing in Kharkiv, holding his phone as he walked through the battered eastern Ukrainian city. He hadn't shaved in several days. His wife and four children had fled early in the war to Germany. A missile strike had damaged his house and injured his dog. He was sleeping at friends' homes some nights. He'd stopped running his business, volunteering instead for the war effort while raging about what Russia was doing to his city and country.

"What happened to these oligarchs - well, I believe they deserved it," Nastenko said. "They robbed their country and [their wealth] is their payment for their silence. They were silent when all these things were happening. They let these things happen."

Sardinia, he said, is a place that symbolizes what his life used to be. It was a place he'd go when his family was still together - renting a home on the water with a covered terrace and a grill where he'd cook oysters. His family picked figs from the garden and went boating along the whitewashed cliffs.

"Our past life," he said.

As he spoke, he paused every now and then, pointing out the sounds of shelling several miles away.

"Listen," he kept saying.

He said that during the war, many of his priorities have changed, and material possessions seem less important than they had before. But returning to Sardinia, he said, was something he still badly wanted. After the war, he said, he'd buy a house there.

Just not the villa of an oligarch.

"No way," he said. "They're toxic."

Italy’s ENI opens rubles bank account for Russian gas payments

ROME

Italy’s energy company, ENI, said Tuesday it opened two bank accounts in Russia’s Gazprom Bank -- one in euros and the other rubles -- to keep paying for Russian gas deliveries.

ENI, which is controlled by the Italian state, said it informed the government of the decision, insisting it was in “compliance with the current international sanctions framework” hitting Russia in retaliation for its war in Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said in March that his country would no longer accept payments in euros for gas and demanded rubles -- a request that was initially rejected by EU countries.

But since, a compromise solution emerged, whereby EU energy companies would nominally keep paying in euros via Gazprom Bank, but then allow the money to be moved to another bank account and converted to rubles.

Last week, during a visit to the US, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said the arrangement was acceptable as long as it is not formally declared in breach of the EU sanctions regime. “It’s a grey zone here,” he said.

“The new procedure should be neutral in terms of both cost and risk, and not incompatible with the existing sanctions. The payment obligation can be fulfilled with the transfer of euros,” ENI said in a statement.

But the Italian company said it was seeking “complete, exhaustive and contractually grounded” clarifications from Gazprom “to resolve the uncertainty regarding the changes introduced by the new payment procedure and the correct allocation of costs and risks.”

Otherwise, ENI threatened to “start an international arbitration based on Swedish law,” It also said it was ready to comply with “any possible future” EU decision to sanction the Russian gas sector.

Italy is one of the biggest buyers of Russian gas in Europe. Last year, Gazprom covered about 40% of its domestic consumption. But Rome is now trying to drastically reduce its energy dependence on Moscow, with new gas supply deals from Africa and elsewhere.

ITALY has been exposed for buying four times more oil from Russia since the start of the Ukraine war, despite EU efforts to slap an embargo down on the fossil fuel.

In May alone, Italy reportedly imported 450,000 barrels of Russian crude oil per day. This is four times more than the country was buying off Russia in February, when Russia first invaded Ukraine, according to Kpler, a commodity data company. The move will see Italy become the EU’s biggest import hub for Russian seaborne crude.

It comes as Italian prime minister Mario Draghi signalled his aim to slash his country’s dependence on Russian gas in a major U-turn.

Mr Draghi had been accused of hamstringing harsher sanctions when the bloc was mulling over a fifth package back in March.

One EU diplomat told The Times: "It’s becoming clearer by the day that three sides are forming: Poland and the Baltic states, known as the Sanctionistas that want more and stronger sanctions.

"Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria — the Contras — that prioritise their own economic interests.”

But after securing a gas deal with Algeria, the Italian Prime Minister has appeared more at ease with the EU’s sanction plans.

Now, Italy is backing the EU’s proposed embargo that would see all Russian oil from Europe banned by the end of the year.

Last year, the EU imported a staggering €48.5billion of crude oil in 2021, and €22.5billion of petroleum oils other than crude from Russia.

And as the war rumbles on the bloc continues to hand Russia billions.

But the embargo plans have been hit with fierce opposition from Hungary which argues it needs financial support to be able to cope with the ban.

And as all 27 nations of the union need to agree for a sanctions package to go through, the EU has been scrambling to convince Budapest to cave.

Now, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has suggested pumping €2billion into oil infrastructure to persuade Hungarian President Viktor Orban.

This is because it helps landlocked eastern European states like Hungary slash their dependence on Russian crude.

Italy has also appeared to cave to Putin’s pressure after one of its gas companies agreed to pay for Putin's gas in rubles.

Italian energy company Eni announced it will open a ruble-denominated account at Gazprombank.

This is to ensure that its next payment for Russian gas due in the "next few days” gets accepted by Russia.

It comes after Putin has warned “unfriendly” countries that they must buy Russian gas in rubles by March 31 or else face a supply cut.

He made clear that to do so, European nations must open up ruble accounts in Russian banks, and if not, Moscow would rip up its gas contracts.

The Italian company appears to have caved to the demand, despite fears that it could undermine Western sanctions.

Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said back in April: "Our guidance here is very clear.

"If this is not foreseen in the contract, to pay in rubles is a breach of our sanctions."

Could a cartel of large energy consumers cut oil and gas prices?

Italy’s PM Mario Draghi suggests big consumers club together to limit how much is paid and raises idea of EU gas price cap

Energy prices are skyrocketing as the world confronts the economic ramifications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, supply chain bottlenecks and the lingering effects of Covid-19 lockdowns. But Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, has a plan.

The celebrated former European Central Bank president recently broached the idea of creating a “cartel” of oil consumers at a meeting with Joe Biden. Just as the biggest oil-producing nations club together through Opec[https://www.theguardian.com/business/opec] to agree annual oil production quotas, Draghi has suggested big energy consumers join forces to increase their bargaining power.

He suggests two options: either “a cartel of buyers” working together to negotiate prices, or a “preferred path” of persuading Opec and other big producers to increase output.

Draghi and the US president also discussed implementing a cap on wholesale gas prices, an idea pushed by Italy within the EU for the past three months – although with little detail on how it would operate in practice – but opposed by Germany, the region’s biggest importer of Russian gas. In what the Italian press called “a small victory”, Draghi has managed to raise the topic for discussion at the European Council meeting taking place in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday.

“It will be discussed, and there is the possibility that the commission will then have the job of verifying the conditions of [such a scenario],” Paolo Gentiloni, European commissioner for the economy, told journalists in Rome on Monday. “But I don’t think a decision [on a gas price cap] will be made in these two days.”

Before the war 40% of EU gas and 25% of its oil came from Russia. Italy has made the cap a priority as it seeks alternative sources for its energy. The price of gas imported from Russia has leapt from €20 per megawatt-hour before the invasion of Ukraine to €120.

Since September 2021, the EU’s four largest economies – Germany, France, Italy and Spain – have each spent €20bn-€30bn to artificially lower gas and electricity bills, as well as gas and diesel prices, according to Brussels thinktank Bruegel[https://www.bruegel.org/2022/04/europe-must-get-serious-about-cutting-oil-and-gas-use/]. These subsidies undermine the EU’s support for Ukraine by helping to fund Moscow, as well as draining public finances and harming the environment.

The way to lower inflation is to directly address the issue of high gas prices, Francesco Giavazzi, Draghi’s economic adviser, said. “The point is that all forms of energy, whether from renewable sources or Russia, are currently priced in the same way,” he said. “What needs to be done is to separate the different prices as a function of the source of energy, and this is proving difficult.”

Russia uses a small fraction of its gas at home, and sends the bulk to Europe via pipelines. Once gas starts being poured from wells, you can slow the flow but not stop it. “So the position of the supplier, Russia, is relatively weak,” said Giavazzi. “They could burn the gas in the air but that would be very costly for them, like a big sanction.”

Italy has managed to get many EU states on board for a price cap, including France and Spain, but not the Netherlands or Germany. Roberto Cingolani, Italy’s minister for ecological transition, said: “Countries that oppose [the idea] defend the concept of a free market … this free market has allowed gas prices to increase five or six-fold without there being a real physical reason, for example a shortage, which has affected the cost of electricity. Citizens are unable to bear the costs, and businesses suffer the high energy costs of manufacturing.”

Yet the EU executive has rejected a cap. In a policy paper last week, the European Commission argued the proposal should only be a last resort for an emergency, such as Russia cutting off all gas to the EU. It appeared to have been swayed by analysts arguing that caps could imperil the EU’s climate goals, by blunting the signal for consumers to reduce energy demand.

Meanwhile, the proposed oil buyers’ cartel, more a priority for the US, is simply at the idea stage, but could become a mechanism to convince Opec to increase production should the EU decide to block imports of Russian energy.

Currently the EU is more focused on creating a gas-buyers’ cartel. EU leaders agreed in March to buy gas together to use the union’s heft to get better prices. “We have important leverage,” the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said. “So instead of outbidding each other and driving prices up, we should pull our common weight.”

The EU’s “platform for the common purchase of gas, LNG [liquified natural gas] and hydrogen” launched last month and will look at voluntary common purchase of gas, with the priority of ensuring the refilling of storage facilities. Last winter, EU gas storage fell to unusually low levels, a factor seen as exacerbating surging prices and higher bills. In the long run the group will also turn its attention to hydrogen and renewables, although details remain vague.

The EU consumes three-quarters of the world’s pipeline gas and 16% of ship-transported LNG. Inspired by the example of EU purchasing of Covid vaccines, supporters argue that EU procurement could ensure security of supply and ensure greater transparency about prices. Yet many details are yet to be worked out.

It remains unclear whether all 27 EU member states will sign up, or how easily they could exit existing gas contracts. And the EU still has to agree a law allowing it to buy energy together, which will also have to get round one of the EU’s raisons d’être: breaking up cartels.

Having the EU negotiate deals for private or public companies raises antitrust concerns, as it would put those companies dealing with the cartel in a privileged position vis-a-vis outsiders. “We have a strong antitrust authority in Europe,” says Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at the Bruegel thinktank. “Now how can you create a cartel to buy gas? Probably the only way to do that is to ground the initiative on energy security measures.”

Meanwhile other plans to curb the price of crude are gaining ground. Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, said last week that the commission and the US were working on a proposal to cap global prices.

Michael Bloss, a German Green MEP, says the EU should be creating an oil-consumers’ cartel with other developed countries including the EU, US, Japan and South Korea and the UK, which represent “a huge share of oil consumption” on the global market. “If they together say this is the price we are going to pay, but not more, the sellers, they will have to abide by it … This special time needs special action.”

Minutes of the AGM

Draft version posted on 6 June 2022

DEED OF RECORD (proces-verbaal)

On the thirteenth day of April two thousand and twenty-two as of nine hours ante meridian Central European Summertime, I, Dirk-Jan Jeroen Smit, civil law notary, officiating in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, attended the Annual General Meeting of shareholders of Iveco Group N.V., a public company with limited liability (naamloze vennootschap) incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, having its official seat in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, its corporate office address at Via Puglia 35, 10156 Turin, Italy, and registered with the trade register of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce under number 83102701 (the Company or Iveco Group), virtually held and with the opportunity to be followed via a live webcast that was available on the Company's website (both the Annual General Meeting of shareholders and the corporate body consisting of the shareholders present at that meeting are hereinafter referred to as: the Meeting), with the purpose of taking notarial minutes of the Meeting.

I, Dirk-Jan Jeroen Smit, civil law notary aforementioned, have recorded the following:

1. Opening.

Lady Suzanne Heywood, as the chair of the Meeting (the Chair), opened the Meeting at nine hours ante meridian Central European Summertime and welcomed all present. She announced that:

* Mr. Simonelli, the Senior Non-Executive Director, was unable to attend the Meeting because of a scheduling conflict, therefore the board of directors of the Company (the Board) had appointed Lady Heywood to chair the Meeting;

AMS-NOTARIAL-10139394/2176480-0004

* Mr. Marx, the Chief Executive Officer (the CEO) and several other members of the Board were attending the Meeting through a simultaneous remote connection;

* the external auditor, Mr. Laan of Ernst & Young Accountants LLP ( Ernst & Young), was also attending the Meeting through a remote connection;

* Dirk-JanJeroen Smit, civil law notary aforementioned, was remotely present and had been appointed as secretary of the Meeting, with the purpose of preparing notarial minutes of these proceedings;

* the proceedings would be held in English;

* the convening notice of the Meeting had been published on the Company's website on the first day of March two thousand and twenty-two and the Meeting had been convened in accordance with the legal and statutory requirements;

* the Meeting complied with the Dutch temporary legislative measures which allowed virtual meetings;

* the use of audio/video recording devices by shareholders was not allowed. The Chair explained that, as clarified in the convening notice, in the interest of public health and personal safety, shareholders were not allowed to attend in person and vote during the Meeting. Instead, the Company had given shareholders the opportunity to follow the Meeting via a webcast broadcasted live on the Company's website. To facilitate as much interaction as possible, shareholders were given the opportunity to submit written questions regarding the agenda items. The deadline for doing this was nine hours ante meridiem Central European Summertime on the tenth day of April two thousand and twenty-two. Instructions for submitting questions were included in the convening notice and published on the Company's website. The Chair announced that no questions had been submitted in advance of the Meeting. The Chair pointed out that, no votes could be cast during the Meeting but that shareholders had been given the opportunity to exercise their voting rights prior to the meeting via proxy or web procedure. Only votes submitted before five hours post meridiem Central European Summertime on Wednesday the sixth day of April two thousand and twenty-two had been considered when calculating the voting results. The Chair explained that the voting results would be displayed at the end of each voting item and would be published on the Company's website after the Meeting, in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. The Chair addressed the Meeting and said that last year she had chaired the shareholders' meeting of CNH Industrial N.V. (CNH Industrial) where the spin-off of its On-Highway Business was approved, paving the way for the birth of what was today Iveco Group N.V. She noted at this Meeting having the honour to chair the first annual general meeting (AGM) of the new company. The Chair pointed out that although the Company was new, it could build on a 119-year legacy of success, dedication and know-how. It also benefited from the experience and commitment of

AMS-NOTARIAL-10139394/2176480-0004

a strong management team, a hard-working workforce, the trust of its customers and - she hoped - the support of the shareholders.

The Chair continued by explaining that this new company was focused on commercial and mass transport, powertrain technologies and specialty vehicles. She congratulated the combined CNH Industrial and Iveco Group team that planned and executed the separation flawlessly and stated that she was excited about the future of this new company and the benefits it would get from addressing its markets with renewed focus and vigor. Alongside completing the critical last steps needed to prepare for separation in January of this year, the Iveco Group also had continued to deliver for its customers. In doing this it had relied on the lessons learnt during the initial phases of the pandemic. These had made the Iveco Group more resilient and better positioned to achieve its priorities. Although the pandemic had persisted through two thousand and twenty-one, the Iveco Group had been able to navigate these challenges, having worked closely with its suppliers and dealers, while helping its employees readjust to the new ways of working. In November two thousand and twenty-one, the Iveco Group's CEO , Gerrit Marx, and his Senior Leadership Team, held the Company's first Investor Day. During this presentation details of the plans and financial ambitions for the Company through to two thousand and twenty-six had been shared. The Company had also signed The Climate Pledge, a commitment founded by Amazon and Global Optimism. This committed the Iveco Group to reaching net zero carbon by two thousand and forty, which is ten (10) years ahead of the goal set by the Paris Agreement. This pledge underlined the importance the Company placed on its ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) obligations, including those related to workplace and on-road safety, inclusivity and diversity, and managing the lifecycles of its products in an environmentally friendly way.

The Chair said that last year also saw the inauguration of the Company's joint investment with the US-based Nikola Corporation for the production of heavy- duty Battery and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles in Ulm, Germany. She announced that the production of heavy-duty battery electric vehicles in Ulm had already started and that these would be followed, in two thousand and twenty-three, with production of fuel-cellheavy-duty trucks. Both of these trucks would be commercialized in Europe and in North America. Furthermore, in two thousand and twenty-one the Iveco Group had begun working with the French multinational Air Liquide to accelerate the development of heavy-duty hydrogen mobility in Europe. The Iveco Group had also made a significant step forward with Plus as its European partner in a pilot programme for the validation and integration of the Plus autonomous truck technology with the Iveco Group's latest-generation S- WAY heavy-duty truck. The Chair pointed out that in its first few months as an independent company, the Company continued to be proactive in creating mutually beneficial partnerships. One example of this was the memorandum of understanding that the Company had signed in early March with Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea. The two companies would work together to assess the potential to cooperate in multiple areas

AMS-NOTARIAL-10139394/2176480-0004

including electric powertrains, fuel-cell systems, vehicle automation and connectivity. Another instance was the partnership for e-mobility in Europe that the Company is setting up with Enel-X. The Iveco Group would intend to be a regional leader in this area, acting as a driver in new technologies and opportunities. Two thousand and twenty-two would be pivotal for the development of the Company. The Chair was confident, however, that the Company had both the confidence and the capabilities required to face the challenges and opportunities ahead in an ever- changing industry. The last two years had been challenging for the Iveco Group's business as it had, alongside others, lived through and managed the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Iveco Group then additionally faced the challenges emerging from the humanitarian crisis that was unfolding in Ukraine. The Chair stated that as a responsible organization, the Company of course abided by all the sanction provisions and extraordinary measures in relation to Ukraine and Russia. In addition, the Company had taken steps to protect its people and their families in the areas of conflict and to provide support to local organisations assisting the general population. With the Company's local partner, it had donated Magirus firefighting turntable ladders and delivered them to the Polish border. The Company was evaluating the possibility of donating other vehicles to help communities impacted by the conflict. The Company had also identified three NonProfit Organisations that shared its priority of safeguarding the health and well-being of all and furthering education in Ukraine. AVSI, Soleterre and WeWorld each had a long history of working directly with local populations and were well established in the region so they could effectively reach the people in most need. The Company was also matching all donations made by the Iveco Group employees worldwide. Finally in closing, the Chair said that she and the Board fully endorsed the ambitious and achievable plans set out by Gerrit Marx and his leadership team. They wished them the very best as the Iveco Group moved forward with great energy in its first year of independent operations. She then thanked the Meeting for their continued support and turned the call to Gerrit Marx.

Mr. Marx thanked the Chair and welcomed all shareholder present for joining the Company's first AGM as independently listed company. Before going into the merits of his speech, he associated himself with the Chair's words of support with regards to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. He said that the Company had reacted weeks before the invasion with precaution measures and shortly after the start of the invasion the Company had moved its employees and families out of Ukraine to rented apartments in Poland. Besides vehicles also its powertrain division FPT industrial supports with gensets for local power production.

Mr. Marx explained that the annual report published on the first day of March two thousand and twenty-two which would be brought to the Meeting's approval, was an unusual document for an AGM because it presented the Company-only financial statements of the newly formed company for the period as of the sixteenth day of June two thousand and twenty-one which was the date of incorporation of the

AMS-NOTARIAL-10139394/2176480-0004

Company - to the thirty-first day of December two thousand and twenty-one.Mr. Marx pointed out that it should be considered that until the thirty-first day December two thousand and twenty-one, the Company was a subsidiary of CNH Industrial, having been specifically set up in June two thousand and twenty-one with the purpose of receiving assets (mainly investments in Group subsidiaries), liabilities and equity on the first day of January two thousand and twenty-two, following the demerger of CNH Industrial (the Demerger). As a consequence, those financial statements reflected only the results determined by the start-up activities of a basically "empty box", which until the thirty-first day of December two thousand and twenty-one was not yet the holding company of the new Iveco Group. Mr. Marx explained that in this context, the Demerger qualified as the first "subsequent event" for the Company and therefore the effects of the Demerger were not included in the two thousand and twenty-one results but were only disclosed as subsequent event in the specific paragraph/footnotes. In this respect, in order to give an idea of some indicators of the Iveco Group following the Demerger, a few figures related to the Group's Revenues, Adjusted EBIT (adjusted earnings before interest and tax) and Net Industrial Cash position as already published on the eighth day of February two thousand and twenty-two as "Combined (carve-out) consolidated F/S" for the Company were included in the subsequent events footnote. The Company-only financial statements of the legal entity were presented in the second part of the document, starting from page 30, and were not representative of the Company post Demerger. Furthermore Mr. Marx explained that the document was unusual also for the following reason: considering that at the moment of the filing, the first day of March, two thousand and twenty-two, the Company was no longer an empty box, but already the listed holding company of the Iveco Group following the Demerger. The Company qualified as a Public Interest Entity and therefore the Company had to include, in the first part of the document (the so-called "Board Report"), the usual chapters required by Dutch and European law such as risk factors, corporate governance, etcetera in connection with the preparation of the annual report of a listed company, and those chapters reflected the current set-up of the Iveco Group after the Demerger.

Mr. Marx said that after these technical but important considerations he would talk about the year and the Iveco Group's main accomplishments. He started with saying that the last few months and quarters the Iveco Group had been working hard to successfully finalize all the steps in preparation for the spin-off and the Company's first day of trading, which took place on the third day of January two thousand and twenty-two. This was only one of the priorities that the Iveco Group had managed during two thousand and twenty-one. The supply chain team had faced the continuing challenges of semiconductor shortages and certain COVID-19 pandemic impacts that were ongoing in two thousand and twenty-two.Mr. Marx stated that up to the date of the Meeting, the Iveco Group had successfully launched new products and signed a series of partnerships and memorandums of understanding

Figure skating raises minimum age to 17 following Valieva scandal at Beijing 2022

The International Figure Skating Federation on Tuesday approved raising the minimum competition age from 15 to 17. At an assembly held in Thailand, the governing body of ice skating has approved by a large majority this modification, which will be implemented gradually and will be in force in view of the Olympic Winter Games in Milan 2026.

The world of figure skating thus shakes off the scandal generated in Beijing 2022 by the 15-year-old Russian Kamila Valieva, who competed despite having tested positive in an anti-doping control at the Russian national championships months before the Olympic event. Traces of trimetazidine, an angina drug banned for athletes since 2014, were detected in her tests. The drug is only prescribed to those over 18 years of age. The excuse of the athlete's entourage is that she could have been contaminated by sharing a glass with her grandfather, who takes the medication.

Russia drags the stain of state doping since Sochi 2014, and competes in the Olympic Games with the acronym 'ROC', without anthem or flag. That is why it had to submit the positive detected in St. Petersburg to a counter-analysis by the World Anti-Doping Agency. The laboratory took it slow and did not confirm the result until February 8. By then Valieva had already competed in Beijing and won team gold.

Russian anti-doping authorities followed protocol and provisionally sanctioned the skater. But she appealed and the same authorities who sanctioned her lifted the punishment within 24 hours. The farce aroused the indignation of the International Olympic Committee, the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Skating Federation. All three appealed to keep Valieva's sanction in place so that she could not participate in the individual competition. The Court of Arbitration for Sport, however, ruled in favor of Russia and Valieva and allowed her to continue competing.

The arguments were based on the fact that Kamila Valieva is under 16 years of age and should be specially protected. They underline that Valieva has not tested positive in Olympic testing and that a provisional exclusion would be irreparably damaging to her career in the face of a positive test in circumstances yet to be clarified.

TAD gave Valieva a shot at Olympic glory, which she failed to take. The skater collapsed in the final, fell three times and went from first to fourth place, missing out on the podium. The athlete finished her exercise shattered, crying and disconsolate, aware that the Olympic cycle of Russian skaters does not usually go beyond the age of 17, so Milan would already be too late for her.

Now, a new opportunity is opening up for Kamila Valieva, although she will be 19 years old in Milan 2026. A common age for competitors from other countries, but not so much for the Russians, who must now reorganize their planning.

What have been FIFA's most severe sanctions?

Throughout the history of soccer, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) has imposed exemplary punishments on national teams and players for questionable conduct, which, in certain cases, has led to unfortunate events on the field.

It should be noted that sanctions may vary according to the seriousness of the behavior or event. Let's just look at the case of Byron Castillo, an Ecuadorian soccer player who was allegedly born in Colombia, so that, if this information is proven, in addition to being expelled from soccer, his national team would probably not go to the Qatar 2022 World Cup.

In this context, we tell you which have been the most severe sanctions imposed by FIFA for improper behavior and events that unleashed some act of violence.

Juanito Gómez, 7 years away from soccerThe Spanish footballer and former Real Madrid player was sanctioned twice during his career, which kept him away from European leagues for seven years. The first was because he assaulted German referee Adolf Prokop and one of his linesmen in a match against Grasshoppers of Switzerland in 1978.

The second was when the defender deliberately stepped on the head of German Lothar Matthaus, who ended up on the ground in the middle of the 1987 European Cup semi-final against Bayern Munich. He was given a five-year suspension for this behavior.

Heysel, the greatest tragedy in soccer historyOn May 29, 1985, at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels, during the UEFA Champions League final between Juventus and Liverpool, the most unfortunate event in soccer took place: 39 people suffocated to death. According to the report, this was due to English fans, under the influence of alcohol, provoking the Italians and throwing objects at them. Faced with the avalanche of people, the Italian fans were trapped in an area of the stadium that had no emergency exit and several died of asphyxiation.

As a result of this tragedy, Liverpool was suspended from matches for 10 years, until 1995, although it was later reduced to 1991. The other English clubs were also affected and were suspended from UEFA competitions for five years.

Roberto Rojas, Chilean goalkeeper banned forever from soccerOn September 3, 1989, when Brazil and Chile were playing at the Maracana Stadium in a qualifying match for the 1990 World Cup in Italy, in the 67th minute, a flare fell on the pitch and goalkeeper Roberto Rojas collapsed, pretending to be injured by the firework, which had been thrown from the stands of the home crowd. Although his face was full of blood, TV images showed that the object did not hit the goalkeeper, so he had actually faked an aggression.

Rojas later confessed the truth and said that he had caused the injuries himself with a razor blade he had in his glove. FIFA did not tolerate this unsportsmanlike behavior and he never played professional soccer again. Chile was excluded from the World Cup in Italy and the qualifiers for the 1994 World Cup in the United States.

Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona were sanctioned, but the sanction was rescinded.When the 1984 Copa del Rey final between Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona took place at the Santiago Bernabéu, the tension could not be controlled among the fans, especially at the end of the match. Both soccer players and fans ran around the field and kicked and punched each other.

As a result, Diego Maradona, Clos, Migueli, Andoni Goikoetxea, Sarabia and De Andrés received a three-month ban from playing. However, it was not long after that and in the end none of the players served any punishment. Even Maradona went to Napoli and the others also continued with their activities.

Eric Cantona and his flying kick to a fanFrench footballer Eric Cantona, during his time playing for Manchester United in 1995, kicked a Crystal Palace fan and alleged fascist, Matthew Simmons, in the chest, who shouted at him after being sent off from the match. The English Federation punished him for nine months without playing, also fined him 20 thousand pounds and two weeks of community service.

Luis Suárez and his biteDuring the group stage of the Brazil 2014 World Cup, Uruguayan Luis Suarez bit Giorgio Chiellini when his national team was facing Italy. He was sanctioned for nine matches plus four months out of the courts, he was also fined 82 thousand euros and banned from entering the states.

Expulsion from Russia for the invasion of UkraineIn view of the invasion of Russia and Ukraine, which started at the beginning of 2022, all Russian clubs and national teams were expelled from all FIFA and UEFA competitions. Although this situation is not related to soccer and the Russian Federation appealed through the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to get rid of this measure, so far they continue not to participate.

The tragedy in Querétaro, MexicoOn March 5, 2022, one of the most unfortunate tragedies in soccer took place at the Estadio La Corregidora in Querétaro, Mexico, which left 17 dead and 22 seriously injured. Some of the punishments for the 'Gallos Blancos' club of Queretaro range from a mandatory buyout of the franchise owners or a one-year ban on using the stadium.

"FIFA is appalled. The acts of violence are unacceptable and intolerable. We join the Mexican Football Federation and CONCACAF in condemning this black incident and encourage the authorities to bring justice for the individuals responsible. Our thoughts are with all those who suffered the consequences," was FIFA's statement in response to the terrible incident.

It would hold back inflation, cut funds to Moscow says premier

(ANSA) - ROME, JUN 9 - Premier Mario Draghi reiterated Italy's call for an EU-wide gas-price cap amid soaring energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine as he addressed the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting in Paris on Thursday. "The European Council has approved (the proposal) to consider imposing a cap on the prices of Russian gas imports," Draghi said. "This could limit the increase in inflation and reduce financial flows to Moscow". He added that "discussions are still taking place and the road could be long". He defended the Western sanction imposed on Moscow following the invasion. (ANSA).

Russia gas cut sparks EU crisis: Italy on 'state of alert' standby – Germany turns to coal

The EU is in a crisis after Russian President Vladimir Putin's gas cut sparked a "state of alert" warning in Italy, while Germany has turned to coal as it scrambles to keep the lights on.

Italy is reportedly considering triggering a "state of alert”, an emergency protocol which may involve gas rationing. Currently, the country is in an “early warning” state, but the Russian gas squeeze is looking like the country may be forced to move to the second emergency protocol level on a scale of three.

Related articles

Rome’s Security Committee will meet at the ministry of ecological transition on Tuesday to mull over the state of “alert”, which could eventually result in the curbing of supplies to certain industries.

It comes after Italian energy giant Eni said it would only get half of the 63 million cubic metres per day it had requested from Russia on Friday.

On Wednesday, the company said that gas flow to Italy had been slashed by up to 15 percent by Russia on Wednesday, which reportedly worsened the following day.

Germany, which relies on Russia for 40 percent of its gas, has also urged its citizens and businesses to limit the use of gas to generate electricity.

The country has also been forced to burn more coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, as a result of the Russian gas cut.

Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck said: "That's bitter, but it's simply necessary in this situation to lower gas usage.”

This all comes after Gazprom, the Kremlin-controlled gas giant, announced it would slash deliveries to Germany on June 16, blaming the move on a “delayed return of gas compressor units from repair by Siemens”.

The company is sticking to its word as gas flowing through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline has plummeted.

Mr Habeck said that the squeeze has sparked a “serious” situation in Germany, warning that “every kilowatt hour helps” in his plea to Germans to limit consumption.

And while Gazprom blamed the delay to the return of the repaired equipment on western sanctions, Mr Habeck has unleashed fury at Putin for cutting off Europe’s gas.

Instead, Mr Habeck has argued that the move is a “political decision” from Russia, as well as a pretext for driving up gas prices.

Germany’s Vice-Chancellor said: "It's obvious that Putin's strategy is to unsettle us by driving up the price and dividing us."

He added: "We won't let that happen."

But Janis Kluge, Senior Associate at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, has warned that there may be “no good measure” to limit the impacts of the gas cut.

He tweeted: “There is probably no good measure against it. I'm sceptical that embargo threats or price caps will get cheap gas flowing.

“Germany has built itself a trap, and it will simply have to pay the price for not diversifying away from Russia earlier.“

Germany has repeatedly come under the spotlight for making itself overly reliant on Russian gas, getting around 40 percent of its gas from the country.

As has the whole of the EU, which collectively also gets 40 percent of its gas needs from Russia.

While yet to sanction gas amid Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine, the bloc’s REPowerEU strategy does detail the plot to phase out Russian oil and gas imports by 2027.

Part of the plan involves sourcing gas from alternative producers.

And Italy appears to be making headway with the plan, striking deals for liquefied natural gas supplies to come from Algeria, Angola, the Republic of Congo, and Israel.

Eni also struck a deal with Qatar for the largest LNG project on Sunday.

Italian Prime Minister defends military support to Ukraine before Parliament amid domestic crisis

MADRID, 21 (EUROPA PRESS)

"Only a peace agreed and not suffered can be truly lasting. Italy's strategy moves on two fronts: we support Ukraine and we sanction Russia so that Moscow agrees to sit at the table" of negotiations," he defended.

Draghi has explained that sanctions are working, as the International Monetary Fund has estimated that they will damage the Russian economy by 8.5 points of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). "Time has revealed that these measures are increasingly effective," he has said.

The Italian Prime Minister has highlighted that, shortly after four months of invasion, more than 4,500 civilians have died, a figure that could be much higher, and has explained that there are 135,000 Ukrainian refugees in Italy. "A collective effort must be made for Ukraine and involve international bodies and banks," he has added.

Two Jesuit Priests Murdered in Chihuahua; Hitmen Steal Their BodiesCovid-19 vaccines for children to arrive this Thursday: Lopez-Gatell "Ya soy Aguila", America makes official signing of Cabecita Rodriguez"Italy will continue to work with the EU and the G7 to support Ukraine, to seek peace, to overcome this crisis. This is the mandate received from the Parliament, from you, and this is the guide for our action," he reiterated, as reported by the AndKronos news agency.

With regard to Russian gas, Draghi has pointed out that the Italian Executive moved "quickly" to find alternative sources of supply. "We have signed important agreements with several supplier countries, from Algeria to Azerbaijan, and promoted new investments, including in renewable energies. Thanks to these measures we could significantly reduce our dependence on Russian gas starting next year," he explained.

Finally, Draghi recalled his visit to Kiev last week and said that there he reiterated Italy's position regarding Ukraine's entry into the European Union. "We were among the first to clearly support this position and in the West and for the first time I did it precisely in this Parliament, we will continue to do so also in the EU Council," he has said.

The M5S, the party with the most representatives in the Italian Parliament, is heading for a new rupture in the face of the imminent departure of the current Foreign Minister, who supports Draghi in his willingness to provide military aid to the Ukrainian authorities, while Conte opposes it.

The permanence of the current coalition government does not seem to be in danger, and Draghi has dodged on his arrival at the Senate the questions of journalists who questioned him about his possible concern. "I don't know, let's see," he limited himself to answering.

However, Italian media have revealed that Di Maio is already in the final phase of contacts to create his own parliamentary group, with the hope of bringing together between 30 and 40 elected officials. Di Maio would also continue as foreign minister, Bloomberg reported.

Conte, who has already been Prime Minister, is basically opposed to sending military aid to Ukraine and demands that any step in this direction be made after consultation with parliamentarians. The Executive, however, is not considering submitting this controversy to the scrutiny of the chambers.

The actor Beppe Grillo, founder of the M5S, has avoided taking a position in favor of Conte or Di Maio but has pointed out in his blog that "sunlight is the best disinfectant", appealing to those directly involved to speak "honestly" about their positions.

Despite the possible rupture, all the parliamentary groups, including M5S, have signed a ten-point agreement, including "guaranteeing support and solidarity to the Ukrainian people and institutions", as well as "the EU membership applications of Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and Georgia".

Italian Bonds Underperform as 5 Star Split Weakens Draghi's Govt

Investing.com -- The risk premium on Italy's bonds increased on Wednesday after one of the parties that Prime Minister Mario Draghi depends on for his parliamentary majority split over its policy toward Ukraine.

Foreign Minister Luigi di Maio confirmed on Tuesday that he will leave the 5 Star Movement, the biggest party in Draghi's de facto coalition, over the refusal of its leader Giuseppe Conte to support the shipment of arms to Ukraine to defend itself against the invading Russian forces.

The split raises the likelihood that 5 Star, under Conte, will leave Draghi's government, narrowing the political base for a government that has no direct democratic mandate.

By 05:45 a.m. ET (0945 GMT), the Spread betweenItalian and German 10-year bond yields, a traditional barometer of Eurozone breakup risk, had widened to 206 basis points, from 199 at Tuesday's close. Italy's benchmark stock index, the FTSE MIB, was also the worst performer among the main European indices, with a drop of 2.5%.

Draghi was called upon to take over as Prime Minister in 2021 after the previous coalition collapsed under the strain of managing Italy's response to the pandemic. While the pandemic emergency initially guaranteed Draghi a huge majority in parliament which was unusual for Italy, support for it has frayed in recent months, as Draghi's outspoken support for Ukraine has gone against the traditional sympathy for Russia found on both the left and right-wing fringes of Italian politics. Elections aren't due until 2023.

The Italian economy - which is almost completely dependent on imported fossil fuels - has come under intense pressure from the surge in oil and gas prices this year. Despite that, Draghi has supported all of the western initiatives to sanction and isolate Russia. Italy's Senate approved a bill shipping more weapons to Ukraine earlier this week.

Financial markets have seen the presence of the former European Central Bank President as an essential condition for preventing renewed stress between Italy and the rest of the Eurozone at a time when government budget deficits have widened sharply, exposing the chronic weakness of Italy's sovereign balance sheet. The BTP-Bund spread has soared in recent weeks as the ECB ended a bond-buying policy that allowed it to give more support to the Eurozone's weaker members. Tighter monetary policy in the U.S. has also had the effect of dragging Eurozone yields higher in that time.

The benchmark 10-year yield had hit a nine-year high of 4.28% last week, approaching a level that analysts say will be difficult to sustain in the long term given Italy's low growth over the last two decades. It has since eased to 3.73%, as fears of a recession have triggered inflows to bonds, which are still regarded as lower-risk than equities.

Draghi defends arms shipment to Ukraine and calls for unity

Rome, June 22. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi today defended the shipment of arms to the Ukrainian resistance and called for the unity of the country in the face of the "difficult" decisions that will have to be taken on the matter, during a parliamentary intervention.

"There is a fundamental difference between two points of view. One, mine, according to which Ukraine must defend itself, and sanctions and sending weapons serve this purpose. And the other point, that Ukraine should not defend itself, we should neither sanction nor send more weapons," he explained.

Draghi has appeared before Parliament to outline Italy's position at this week's European Council and does so after the 5 Star Movement (M5S) or the far-right League, two key parties in his coalition, criticized the shipment of arms to Kiev.

In fact the M5S pressed for the Government to change its line and opt to stop arming the Ukrainian resistance, although without success, which caused its split last night with the departure of one of its founders, Luigi Di Maio, who as current Foreign Minister criticized "the ambiguity" of the leadership of the formation on the issue of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In that context, Draghi lamented positions that believe that "Russia is too strong to fight, that we should let it in and let Ukraine submit after all."

"Is it naturally the fault of Europe's sanctions? No, the fault lies with Russia which has declared war on Ukraine," he exclaimed in a rejoinder in the Chamber of Deputies, prompting applause from the benches

Draghi also blamed Russia for the "humanitarian tragedy looming over the poorest countries stemming from the famine and food crisis" due to the grain blockade in the Black Sea.

"Unity is essential at this time because the decisions we have to make are very difficult, because it has to do with the war but also with our internal economic and social situation. Unity is essential," the prime minister urged.

The parties in Mario Draghi's coalition of national unity have drafted a resolution on Italy's position on Ukraine in which they have agreed that every decision should go through Parliament, including the shipment of arms.

The resolution, the cause of the schism in the M5S, was approved yesterday in the Senate and will be submitted this morning to a vote in the Chamber of Deputies, which will serve Draghi to count on what support he has after the rupture in the aforementioned party.

Donald Trump’s plans to take his social media app public are facing another setback after a federal grand jury issued subpoenas to the company trying to buy it.

The former president launched Truth Social in February, a year after he was banned from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube in the wake of the US Capitol riots.

Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates the app, was in the process of being bought by a special purpose acquisition company (Spac) called Digital World Acquisition Corp in a deal that would take it public.

But Digital World revealed that it and every member of its board has received subpoenas from a grand jury in New York.

It warned that the subpoenas, which are seeking a number of documents linked to the company, could delay the takeover.

It’s the latest blow to Trump’s media company, which is already facing investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators over potential wrongdoing ahead of the planned deal.

Italian eyewear billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio dies at 87

Italy's Leonardo Del Vecchio, who rose from childhood poverty to build the eyewear empire that owns brands such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, has died at the age of 87.

Del Vecchio added a dash of Italian style to spectacles and became one of Europe's wealthiest men, investing some of his riches to build stakes in Italian financial group Mediobanca and insurer Generali.

The billionaire founded the Luxottica business in 1961, initially to supply components for glasses, and remained the chairman and major shareholder in the world's biggest eyewear group after it combined forces with France's Essilor in 2018.

Partly raised in an orphanage, Del Vecchio's rags-to-riches story mirrored Italy's own recovery after World War Two.

"A leading figure in Italian business for more than 60 years, Del Vecchio created one of the country's largest companies from humble beginnings," said Prime Minister Mario Draghi, calling the entrepreneur "a great Italian".

Post Office workers plan strike for next month

Following strikes by rail workers and barristers, Post Office employees are next. Some 114 Crown Post Office locations will close on July 11 to protest against wages.

An offer of a 3pc raise and one-off payment of £500 for employees at the state-owned utility is “woefully inadequate” with inflation hitting 9.1pc in May and expected to rise further, the Communications Workers Union said.

The Post Office was separated from Royal Mail in 2012.

Andy Furey, the assistant secretary of the CWU, said: “This dispute is about dignity and respect for hard-working employees-essential public servants who, as key workers, provided unprecedented customer service during the pandemic."

Ukraine's richest man sues Russia

Ukraine's richest man has filed a lawsuit against Russia at Europe’s top human rights court, seeking compensation for billions of dollars in business losses since Russia's invasion.

Rinat Akhmetov, owner of the Azovstal steelworks in the city of Mariupol, sued Russia for "grievous violations of his property rights" at the European Court of Human Rights.

His holding company System Capital Management said Mr Akhmetov was also seeking a court order "preventing Russia from engaging in further blockading, looting, diversion and destruction of grain and steel" produced by his companies.

The billionaire said: "Evil cannot go unpunished. Russia's crimes against Ukraine and our people are egregious, and those guilty of them must be held liable.

"The looting of Ukraine’s export commodities, including grain and steel, has already resulted in higher prices and people dying of hunger worldwide. These barbaric actions must be stopped, and Russia must pay in full."

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was no longer under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.

Wimbledon fans face ‘severe disruption’ as tram drivers strike

Tennis fans travelling to Wimbledon this week will fall victim to the latest strike by transport workers, as drivers on the London Tramlink walk out in a row over pay.

Oliver Gill has more:

Strike action will take place on Tuesday and Wednesday this week after drivers rejected a 3pc pay rise.

The London Tramlink runs along 17 miles of track across south London, serving Bromley, Croydon, Sutton and Wimbledon.

Trams run every five minutes during weekdays between Croydon and Wimbledon, carrying tennis fans to the All-England Club.

Transport for London said “severe disruption is expected on both days” and urged people to use alternative public transport.

Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, was urged to intervene in the row to force the operator to pay a “fair pay settlement”, union leaders said.

Fuel prices extend record highs

Fuel prices are still hitting new record highs across the UK even as wholesale prices behind to fall.

The average price of petrol at the pumps rose to 191.05p yesterday, according to the RAC. Diesel hit a record high on Saturday at 199,09p before edging lower a day later.

The numbers suggest retailers aren't yet passing on savings from lower wholesale prices to drivers on the forecourt – something motoring bodies have criticised heavily.

Simon Williams, fuel spokesman at the RAC, said:

We are struggling to see how retailers can justify continuing to put up their unleaded prices as the wholesale cost of petrol as reduced significantly.

Kremlin denies Russian default

Russia has denied it's defaulted on its foreign debts for the first time in a century after a grace period on $100m of missed interest payments ran out.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia made bond payments due in May but the fact they had been blocked by because of western sanctions was "not our problem".

Moscow has struggled to make payments after the White House moved to block channels to creditors in the West, meaning Russia could not settle its debts despite the means and willingness to do so.

Mr Peskov added: "Our position is well known. Our reserves are blocked unlawfully and all attempts to use these reserves will also be unlawful and would amount to outright theft."

The default marks the first time Russia has failed to make payments to international bondholders since the Bolshevik revolution in 1918.

Oil prices fluctuate as traders keep an eye on G7

Oil prices are wavering this morning as traders monitor the G7 for any signs of a price cap on Russian crude.

Benchmark Brent crude dipped slightly to just below $113 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate hovered at around $107 after posting its first back-to-back weekly loss since April.

World leaders are drawing up plans on a potential price cap on Russia oil imports that could help to ease the surge in prices while also punishing the Kremlin.

Meanwhile, mounting fears of a recession and a drop-off in demand are pushing oil prices towards their first monthly decline since November.

Ukraine grain exports crash 44pc

Ukraine's grain exports have tumbled by around 44pc so far this month as Russia's warmongering cuts off key supplies and drives up food prices around the globe.

Exports stood at 1.1m tonnes in the first 22 days of June, according to the country's agriculture ministry. This included 978,000 tonnes of corn, 104,000 tonnes of wheat and 24,000 tonnes of barley.

Prior to Putin's invasion, Ukraine shipped as much as 6m tonnes of grain per month.

Britain has committed £10m in aid to help rebuild Ukraine's railways as a blockade of Black Sea ports leaves millions of tonnes of grain stranded.

Putin is using hunger as a weapon of war and we cannot allow his blockade of Ukrainian grain to continue.

Today the UK is pledging up to £10m in aid to help Ukraine repair its rail infrastructure so Ukrainians can resume their crucial exports. https://t.co/KIopdEzGzJ[https://t.co/KIopdEzGzJ]

France's public finances 'at alert level'

France's public finances have reached an "alert level" amid rising interest rates, surging inflation and slowing growth, the country's finance minister has said.

The warning comes as President Emmanuel Macron's government looks to negotiate a revised 2022 budget with opposition parties after he lost his majority in the National Assembly in elections earlier this month.

Bruno le Maire told local media: "Not everything is possible, quite simply because we have reached an alert level for public finances.

"We used to be able to borrow at 0pc or at negative rates, but today we are borrowing at more than 2pc."

The finance minister also said debt charges on inflation-linked bonds will rise by "several billion euros" as prices continue to surge.

G7 prepares Russian oil price cap

The G7 is drawing up plans to punish Vladimir Putin with a cap on the price of Russian oil that could also calm inflation.

Louis Ashworth has the details:

Wealthy nations would effectively create a buyer’s cartel to drive down the value of the Kremlin’s most lucrative export.

Leaders and officials are mulling a mechanism that would only allow Russian crude and petroleum products to be sold and stored at below a certain price.

Talks will aim to maintain Chinese and Indian access to cheaper crude from Russia, rather than attempting to bring about a full boycott that could send prices surging.

Countries are grappling with how to keep pressure on Mr Putin through sanction without exacerbating the inflationary crises many are facing at home.

Finding ways to lower the oil price could starve Russia of vital funding while also easing costs for businesses and households.

Officials in the US and German governments have said plans are being hashed together at the G7 summit in Bavaria, with hopes that a fully-fledged plan can be announced tomorrow.

Rouble weakens as Russia crashes into default

The rouble weakened in volatile trade in Moscow after Russia defaulted on its foreign debts for the first time in a century.

After narrowly swerving non-payment several times since launching an invasion of Ukraine in late February, Moscow failed to pay $100m of coupons on bonds due last month, for which a 30-day grace period ended on Sunday.

The rouble fell 0.5pc against the dollar to 53.68, at one point shedding around 2pc and touching its weakest since June 21. Against the euro it was down 0.6pc.

Soap maker PZ Cussons to cash in on higher prices

Consumer goods group PZ Cussons has said it's on track to boost revenue from raising prices even as shoppers swap in value ranges.

The maker of Carex and Imperial Leather said it expects full-year sales to rise 3pc, with full-year revenue set to hit £590m.

PZ Cussons said it had been boosted by higher prices, but warned that trading conditions remained challenging as soaring inflation piles pressure on household budgets.

Jonathan Myers, chief executive of PZ Cussons, said:

We have plans in place to mitigate the impact of this, as we continue to deliver great value for consumers, whilst also investing behind more premium innovations.

UK takes stake in sex party planner Killing Kittens

The Treasury has taken a stake in a sex party planner founded by a schoolmate of the Duchess of Cambridge.

Killing Kittens, which was founded in 2005 by Emma Sayle, is known for its exclusive, hedonistic events in cities around the world, but was forced to cancel its in-person parties during the pandemic.

The taxpayer has now taken a stake through Rishi Sunak's Future Fund programme, which was set up during Covid to help innovative firms, the Financial Times reports.

Loans granted through the Future Fund convert to equity at the company's next fundraising. It's offered support to hundreds of businesses, including Bolton Wanderers football club and the Black Sheep Coffee chain.

FTSE risers and fallers

The FTSE 100 has pushed higher in early trading as an easing of Covid restrictions in China brought relief to commodity prices.

The blue-chip index rose 0.6pc, driven by gains for major mining stocks.

Rio Tinto rose 2.6pc after a US appeals court ruled that the Government may give the copper miner a right to lands in Arizona.

Anglo American, Glencore and Antofagasta all pushed higher thanks to a rebound in copper and iron ore prices as rules were eased in Shanghai and several other major Chinese cities.

BAE Systems also edged higher after the defence giant secured a $12bn contract from the US Department of Defence.

The domestically-focused FTSE 250 also gained 0.6pc, with cruise operator Carnival rising more than 5pc.

Gas prices jump as Europe struggles to refill storage

Natural gas prices rose again this morning as Russia's supply cuts threaten to spark shortages this winter.

European countries have found it difficult to replace Russian gas after the Kremlin cut flows through a major pipeline to around 40pc of normal levels.

This has slowed the pace of refilling storage sites, which are crucial to get the continent through winter.

Benchmark European prices rose more than 5pc in early trading after jumping 9pc last week.

Humiliation for Putin as Russia defaults on foreign debts

Russia has defaulted on its foreign debts for the first time in a century, in a humiliating blow to Vladimir Putin that further freezes his country out of the Western financial system.

Louis Ashworth has more:

After narrowly swerving non-payment several times since launching an invasion of Ukraine in late February, Moscow failed to pay $100m of coupons on bonds due last month, for which a 30-day grace period ended on Sunday.

Payment had been rendered practically impossible after the White House moved to block channels to creditors in the West, meaning Russia could not settle its debts despite the means and willingness to do so.

The default – the first time Russia has failed to make payments to international bondholders since the Bolshevik revolution in 1918 – is mainly a symbolic event for now: Russia is already a pariah within the Western financial system and is unlikely to tap international markets for money in the near future.

But it will further tie Mr Putin’s hands as the country suffers its biggest economic shock in years, and could starve Russian companies of future funding options if the contagion spreads to corporate bonds.

World on 'tipping point' of permanently high prices

KPMG is not the only organisation warning over inflation this morning, as my colleague Tim Wallace reports:

The world is on the “tipping point” of falling into a period of runaway inflation in which soaring prices become embedded and difficult to control, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has warned.

In its annual economic report, the BIS said leading economies faced entering a world in which soaring prices become embedded and difficult to control.

It called on central banks to step up efforts to tackle soaring prices while limiting the impact to growth.

Agustín Carstens, general manager of the BIS, said: “The key for central banks is to act quickly and decisively before inflation becomes entrenched.

“If it does, the costs of bringing it back under control will be higher. The longer-term benefits of preserving stability for households and businesses outweigh any short-term costs.”

Central banks around the world, including in the UK and US, hoped last year that rising inflation would be “transitory”.

City watchdog investigates Wise boss after tax breach

The Financial Conduct Authority has opened an investigation into the chief executive of Wise almost a year after he was fined by HMRC for deliberately defaulting on his taxes.

The Telegraph last year revealed that Kristo Kaarmann had been fined £365,651 for a deliberate default during the 2017/18 tax year on a £720,495 tax bill.

The City regulator has now said it's examining the “regulatory obligations and standards to which Kaarmann is subject”.

David Wells, chairman of Wise, said the company will “cooperate fully with the FCA as and when they require, while continuing to support Kristo in his role as CEO”.

The London-listed payments firm an investigation with an external legal counsel after Mr Kaarmann’s name was included on HMRC’s list of individuals and businesses receiving penalties for a deliberate default regarding their tax affairs.

It said the board shared details of the findings, assessment and actions with the FCA.

KPMG: BoE must weigh recession risks

Yael Selfin, chief UK economist at KPMG, says the Bank of England will have to balance interest rate rises with the risk of recession.

We expect supply issues to gradually ease during the course of this year, although headwinds in the form of a potential deterioration in Russian energy supply or further lockdowns in China as a result of its zero Covid policy could worsen the outlook.

Combined with the pressures on household budgets, the Monetary Policy Committee will have to weigh the risk of high inflation spilling into pay growth against the risk of a recession.

Britain at risk of 'mild' recession

Good morning.

The UK could be pushed into a recession as runaway inflation threatens to all but wipe out economic growth.

KPMG has become the latest organisation to sound the alarm, saying there was roughly a 50pc chance of Britain being tipped into a "mild recession".

It warned the UK was particularly vulnerable to a downturn if a cut-off of Russian gas supplies caused a contraction in the eurozone economy, or if aggressive interest rate rises in the US sparked a recession there.

KPMG forecast that the UK economy will slow to 3.2pc this year from 7.1pc in 2021, before almost grinding to a halt at 0.7pc next year.

Iran regime terrorist spy operations spread in Austria - intel report

Austria is a “spy paradise” for Iran, Russia, China and Turkey because of weak criminal penalties for espionage.

Austria’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism released a new report in January, asserting Iran’s regime spread its nefarious spy activities[https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/germany-is-a-hotbed-of-iranian-spy-activity-that-targets-israel-488767] in the central European country and Austria is “attractive” for such bad actors as China, Russia, Iran and Turkey because of weak criminal penalties for espionage.

According to the report dated for the year 2021, “Over the years, the network of Iranian intelligence services[https://www.jpost.com/international/article-721211] has also spread in Austria. For civil domestic and foreign surveillance, the Ministry of Information (MOIS) is responsible. The military home and foreign intelligence services emerge from the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard (and is referred to as IRGC-IO – Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Intelligence Organization). The military special unit Quds Force also plays a not insignificant role, which, in addition to extraterritorial military operations, is specialized in obtaining intelligence information.”

The US government classified the IRGC a foreign terrorist organization in 2019. The European Parliament last week voted for a non-binding resolution to sanction the IRGC as a terrorist entity[https://www.jpost.com/international/article-729066]. The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said on Monday the EU needs a court ruling[https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-729315] that declares the IRGC engages in terrorist activities before the 125,000 military force can be proscribed a terrorist organization.

The Austrian intelligence report said cyber espionage[https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-716592] in Austria was largely carried out by Russia, China and Iran.

In sharp contrast to previous reports that largely ignored Shi’ite terrorist and espionage activities from Iran, the new report devoted analysis to the Islamic Republic.

According to the intelligence document, foreign spy services find it “attractive” to operate on Austrian national territory because of “the very low threat of punishment. “The report noted the Austrian intelligence services have, in contrast to European services, weak intelligence gathering powers.”

Austria is also a hotbed of spy activity, according to the report, because of its “good geo-political situation” and location of a number of international organizations, as well as the economic strength of the Alpine county.

The Austrian Economic Chambers reported on it that in “the first half of 2022, Austria exported goods worth 98.1 million euros to Iran – an increase of +113.1% compared to the same period of the previous year.”

The business group added that “In the year as a whole, Austria exported goods worth 117.8 million euros to Iran (+17.6% compared to the previous year).”

Is Austria a spying paradise?

Espionage in Austria takes place under the disguise of diplomacy in foreign embassies and consulates, noted the report. Spies for foreign nationals also operate “in clubs, cultural centers, press agencies, airlines or other business locations,” wrote the Austrian intelligence officials.

“Austria is a spy paradise,” headlined the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation in its article on the new intelligence report.

Austria is an important location for Turkey’s MIT intelligence service because the large community of people of “Turkish origin” in Austria, noted the intelligence agency report.

“The main focus of the Turkish intelligence services is particularly focused on critics of the regime and opponents and to clarify the Gülen movement and the PKK, since these are classified by the Turkish government as extremist or terrorist,” said the intelligence report.

China’s spy operation, according to the report, is dedicated to the collection of information on the “military capabilities of foreign military forces” as well to securing ”military-related scientific and technological information.”

The Austrian report said that Russian intelligence has been operating unchanged in Austria with “high intensity” for “some time.” The Russian espionage operation targets “the recruitment of employees in institutions of special interest to the Russian Federation.”

BP expects to approve the final investment decision for three green hydrogen projects in Europe by the end of 2023, a company official told S&P Global Commodity Insights Jan. 18.

"We are looking to sanction projects for the delivery of hydrogen to our European refineries, across Spain, Germany and Netherlands," Felipe Arbelaez, senior vice president for hydrogen and CCS, said on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week in Abu Dhabi.

"So, you will be looking at an about 18-to-24 months period" to finalize the projects, which will be phased, with volumes varying site by site but being roughly in the 100 MW range," he added.

BP's European refineries are located in clusters, such as Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Valencia Valley in Spain, where hydrogen demand is high in its own operations as well as among its partners and industrial participants that will be able to utilize green hydrogen, he added. The company is looking at hydrogen projects in Europe with distribution systems that can easily transport hydrogen to customers, he added. BP announced Jan. 16 it would examine the construction of a hydrogen hub in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, converting imported green ammonia back into hydrogen.

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** Poland's PKN Orlen said Jan. 20 it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil products loading terminal in Gdansk. PKN said both investments are scheduled to be commissioned by mid-2025. The hydrocracking base oils project will help the company diversify into second- and third-generation base oils.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** The expansion of Orlen Unipetrol's steam cracker at Litvinov is still ongoing, the company said Dec. 2022. The company said in October 2021 it was contracting Technip Energies to build a new steam cracker furnace to be commissioned in 2022. The construction of an 11th furnace is set to boost production capacity to 585,000 mt/year of ethylene from 545,000 mt/year. The company plans to increase total petrochemical production capacity to 1.4 million mt/year by 2030 from 900,000 mt/year.

PKN Orlen has completed the Czech Koruna 9.6 billion ($410 million) polyethylene 3 unit investment at Litvinov. The refinery's owner, Unipetrol, a 100%-owned PKN subsidiary, has taken charge of the black polyethylene unit, the second part of the investment. The first part, the natural polyethylene unit, was completed in April 2020. The polyethylene 3 unit, which can produce 270,000 mt/year of high density polyethylene, will replace production of one of the two existing production units with a capacity of 120,000 mt/year. Litvinov's polyethylene capacity will increase from 320,000 mt/year to 470,000 mt/year. PKN Orlen was launching construction of a unit at Litvinov to produce up to 26,000 mt/year of dicyclopentadiene, or DCPC, used in the automotive, construction and electronic industries. Separately, McDermott International has been awarded a contract for engineering, procurement and construction management services for an upgrade of the hydrocracker at the Litvinov refinery.

** Motor Oil Hellas has approved an investment into a new propylene splitter unit at the Corinth refinery. It will have 100,000 mt annual capacity and is expected to be completed by 2026. It will use the existing infrastructure of the FCC unit which will switch part of the gasoline production into propylene. The splitter is a "significant step" towards diversifying the refinery operations, the company said.

It will be built in the industrial zone east of the refinery. At full power the park will be able to supply more than 60% of the refinery's needs.

** ExxonMobil, Macquarie's Green Investment Group, and SGN are studying the potential for a low-carbon hydrogen hub centered around ExxonMobil's Fawley refinery on the UK's south coast. Initial hydrogen production could be around 4.3 TWh/year from 2030. Hydrogen demand in the Southampton industrial cluster around the refinery could reach 37 TWh by 2050.

** Italy's Saras is working on activating a green hydrogen plant for a total of 20 MW. Saras is building the green hydrogen plant with Italian utility Enel. The hydrogen produced would be used at the Sarroch refinery. It is currently provided by the IGCC complex and two reforming units on the industrial site.

** The Refhyne II consortium, developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for Shell's Rheinland refinery in Germany at its Wesseling site, has received a Eur32.4 million grant from the EU. The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Polish refiner PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million ($150 million) investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery. The unit will process used rapeseed oil to produce an additive to diesel or aviation fuel. The annual production of the unit will be 300,000 mt of biodiesel or aviation biofuel. The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies will stop using palm oil at La Mede from 2023. The biorefinery has already significantly reduced the amount of palm oil it processes from 500,000 mt/year initially to 100,000 mt/year in 2021. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

LAUNCHES

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Turkey's Ersan Petrol is still hopeful of its plans for a 1.4 million mt/year refinery at Kahramanmaras in southeast Turkey will be able to go ahead despite repeated delays and a difficult investment climate. Project coordinator Cenk Pala said Ersan was in talks with prospective partners and sources of finance for the project and hopes to start work on the FEED study this year. The refinery is planned for a 300,000 sq m site in Kahramanmaras which holds a defunct mini refinery that will be dismantled. A pre-feasibility study by Axens has defined the configuration and capacity of the plant which will produce mainly Euro 5 diesel, Euro 5 gasoline, jet and bitumen.

** A new greenfield Porto Romano refinery in Albania will be predominantly oriented to export markets but will also be able to cover Albania's domestic demand, Helmut Mayrhofer, consultant at Larkalis said. Austria-based consultancy Larkalis is leading an international consortium working on the project which will involve building the refinery in the port town of Durres. The refinery has a two-year construction authorization and could be commissioned by end-2025, depending on international developments.

** Azeri state oil company Socar is considering developing a second refinery in Turkey, in addition to its existing 214,000 b/d Star refinery at Aliaga on Turkey's central Aegean coast.

Austrian bank RBI needs more time for Russia plans despite Ukraine sanctions

Raiffeisen Bank International AG's planning around the future of its Russian business has not changed for now despite recent sanctions imposed by Ukraine, CEO Johann Strobl said.

Austria-based RBI is working "with quite a lot of manpower and external advice" to find a solution for its Russian business. All options are being considered, including a sale or deconsolidation, Strobl said during the bank's full-year 2022 earnings presentation Feb. 1.

"We permanently have to adjust," he said but did not give a time frame for a decision. "I can only assure you that we are working on the assessment of the options ... we have, and leaving Russia is one of the options," Strobl said.

A Russian leasing unit of RBI, which has the highest exposure to Russia among European banks, was put on a sanction list the Ukrainian government released Jan. 29.

RBI does not expect a major financial impact given that most of the unit's approximately €360 million leasing volume is linked to vehicles unlikely to be used in Ukrainian territory. The risk of repossession or confiscation is, therefore, "very small," Strobl said.

The group will nonetheless closely monitor future sanction risks in Ukraine as the issue has brought renewed attention to RBI's business in Russia, the CEO said. "For the first time, an RBI entity is sanctioned, and one has to observe and analyze what it could mean," he said.

Russian countersanctions have made the sale of Western ban subsidiaries in the country, including RBI's unit Joint Stock Company Raiffeisenbank, more difficult.

Reduced exposure

RBI's exposure to Russia fell to €16.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 from €22.6 billion in the third quarter, according to the bank's earnings report.

There is no obligation to recapitalize the Russian operations, and the loan portfolio in the country is expected to remain around current levels, the bank said. Loans to customers at RBI's Russian arm amounted to €8.99 billion as of Dec. 31, 2022, down from €11.64 billion a year ago.

The common equity Tier 1, or CET1, ratio for Russia was 27.14%, well above the minimum local capital requirement of 19.14%, RBI's records show. The group has strengthened its overall capitalization, with total transitional CET1 ratio, including retained earnings, standing at 16% as of the end of 2022.

Dividend outlook

RBI can afford to deconsolidate its Russian business while also paying a dividend on 2022 profits and making necessary repayments on subordinated instruments, bank records show. That would reduce total group CET1 ratio to 14%, above the 13.5% target the bank had set as a precondition for its zero price-to-book deconsolidation scenario for the Russian business, the records show.

Nevertheless, RBI will not rush to pay the €0.80 per share dividend it plans to propose for 2022, Strobl said. The timing of the final decision is "uncertain and unlikely to be made" at the annual general meeting on March 31, according to the bank's earnings statement. Approval by an extraordinary general meeting later in the year would depend on capital ratio development and "ongoing strategic considerations," RBI said.

Key earnings driver

The Russian unit has been by far the largest contributor to RBI's earnings in 2022, accounting for over 50% of the group's annual after-tax profit and about 40% of operating income. Yet, given the sanctions, the group cannot distribute profits from its Russian operations.

The Russian business was a key driver of RBI's operating performance in 2022, boosting group net interest income, or NII, and net fee and commission income, or NFCI, over the period. The business is expected to remain a major contributor to RBI's NII and NFCI in 2023, based on the group's current guidance.

RBI expects 2023 group NII of up to €4.7 billion, compared to €5.05 billion achieved in 2022. Excluding the businesses in Russia and Belarus, 2023 group NII would reach up to €3.4 billion, matching the 2022 result. Earnings from Belarus also cannot be distributed due to sanctions.

While the two units are driving earnings, they also account for higher operating and risk costs. Group operating expenses are expected to reach up to €3.7 billion in 2023, but excluding Russia and Belarus, expenses would drop to about €3 billion.

Neutrality and support for Ukraine: Austria’s tightrope walk

Neutrality has long been at the core of Austria’s post-World War II identity. While the country pledged millions to support Ukraine and has supported the EU sanctions against Russia, it also wants to keep the communication channels with the Kremlin open, Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner told EURACTIV Germany in an exclusive interview.

According to data[https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/] from the Kiel Institute for World Economy, Austria has pledged more than €580 Million to Ukraine – mostly in humanitarian aid. “Every request that comes from Ukraine, everything that is needed, is checked by us and then also delivered,” Tanner stressed.

However, the neutrality that is enshrined in the Austrian constitution won’t allow for any weapon deliveries.

“It is important to emphasise that while we are militarily neutral according to our constitution and legal regulations, we are certainly not politically neutral when it comes to Ukraine,” Tanner told EURACTIV. “That is why we have supported all EU sanctions from the very beginning. Because the point is to stand in solidarity with Ukraine,” she added.

Despite this political commitment to Ukraine, Austria still seeks to keep channels with Russia open.

While the EU has put all members of the Russian Duma on its sanction list in February 2022, Austria will open its gates for Russian parliamentarians later this month, when the OSCE assembly meeting in Vienna.

The decision has been heavily criticised by EU allies, especially since the parliamentary assembly will meet exactly one year after Russia started its war against Ukraine.

“I think it’s important not only to help but also to keep diplomatic channels open. That is certainly happening,” Tanner stressed, adding that “We have a great history in Austria as mediators.”

“It’s just difficult, as long as the weapons are talking, diplomacy is put in the second row, so to speak. But that doesn’t mean that you don’t have to make an effort every day. And that also happens,” Tanner emphasised.

Migration Austria, due to its proximity to Ukraine, has been a preferred destination for Ukrainian refugees following Russia’s attack on the country, taking in “over 50,000 war refugees,” Tanner stressed.

“We have taken them in and looked after them. I think that is a very important achievement,” she explained, adding that Austria’s government had ensured that the Ukrainian refugees, mostly women and children, received access to childcare and schooling.

Simultaneously, Austria has also been on the receiving end of an asylum seeker influx comparable to that during the refugee crisis of 2015, putting additional stress on the system. In 2022, applications for asylum tripled to more than 100,000, the largest spike registered in the EU[https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/austria-registers-highest-spike-in-asylum-application-in-eu/].

Meanwhile, Hungary, which recently struck a migration pact with Austria and Serbia, registered a mere 46 applications within its borders. “That says it all, I think,” Tanner noted, adding that “this is a cause for concern because it shows that obviously, the Europe-wide system is not working.”

That has become the reason that Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer and Interior Minister Gerhard Karner are “fighting to face this problem together as the European Union,” she said.

In doing so, the Austrian government has been looking for allies ahead of a special EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Wednesday (8 February). “This is an everyday task,” she stressed, adding that Karner had gone to Italy to meet his counterpart and discuss the issue.

Austria "between Scylla and Charybdis" in OSCE conference

Vienna/Kyiv/Moscow - Austria is a tight spot over Russia's participation in an OSCE meeting in Vienna, says an international legal expert. "Austria is moving between Scylla and Charybdis", said Peter Hilpold to the APA.

While Austria had the legal possibility to deny entry to the Russian delegation, but would have to take the international legal responsibility for it. The Austrian foreign ministry had a different view on this.

If the arrival was permitted as announced, however, then the international accusation of bypassing sanctions or even violating sanctions was possible, even though this was not entirely correct from an EU standpoint, said the expert from the University of Innsbruck. EU sanctions were not strictly given in this case. The only concrete accusation which could be lobbed at Austria was that the country had not used a sanction possibility. "Politically speaking, this is delicate enough, no doubt about it", said the expert.

The headquarters agreement between Austria and the OSCE, which Austrian foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg (conservative People's Party, VP) was referring to, offered enough options, according to Hilpold. The agreement made it mandatory for Austria to make the entry "easier" for members of delegations from OSCE member states. Sanctions were not addressed. "'Making it easier' did not necessarily mean an obligation to make an exception for sanctions", said the expert.

Austrian FM defends Russian participation at OSCE meeting

Russian delegates should not be excluded from participating in the upcoming OSCE assembly meeting in Vienna, said Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg after parliamentarians from 20 OSCE countries urged his government last week to bar Russian diplomats from attending.

The meeting will be held in Vienna on 23-24 February, exactly one year after Russia invaded Ukraine. All members of the Russian delegation announced so far are on sanction lists of the European Union according to Der Standard.[https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000143074561/oesterreich-droht-eklat-wegen-visa-fuer-russen-auf-eu-sanktionsliste]

As the host to the OSCE headquarters, Austria must allow all delegates from all participating states to enter Austria, said Schallenberg who also regretted the meeting’s planned date as “a very unfortunate one”.

“But at the same time, we must not disregard the fact that we need platforms. The OSCE has never been an organisation of like-minded people,” he told the Austrian Public Broadcast’s show Zeit im Bild in an interview on Sunday evening.

Every relationship and every conversation with Russia would be difficult, “but we have to stay in dialogue”, he said. “Because at some point, hopefully, diplomacy will be given space again.”

Among the countries that called on Austria to prevent Russian officials from entering the country[https://www.diepresse.com/6246145/osze-brandbrief-an-oesterreich-verhindert-teilnahme-der-russischen-delegation], Lithuania even threatened to boycott the meeting if Austria were not to even consider the call.

“Our delegation will probably not be able to go there and sit in the same room with the people who should be standing before a special military tribunal because those people are directly responsible for initiating the war,” the leader of the Lithuanian delegation Vilija Aleknaitė-Abramikienė told reporters at the Lithuanian parliament on Friday, LRT reported[https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1881843/lithuania-threatens-to-boycott-osce-event-if-russian-mps-are-invited].

Speaking about Lithuania’s announced boycott, Schallenberg said during the Zeit im Bild interview that it would be “a pity” for the OSCE parliamentary assembly, which brings together parliamentarians from the OSCE countries, to be so “emotionally overloaded” while the OSCE ambassadors’ meeting would take place every Tuesday in the Hofburg palace in Vienna.

It would also be of value to show how isolated Russia had become and to make clear there is “no return to the status quo ante” with someone like President Vladimir Putin, Schallenberg added.

Still, it would be important that the Austrian nation distinguishes “between Putin, his system and his henchmen and Russia, its history, its culture and also its people”, he added.

The OSCE is currently struggling to get its 2023 budget approved due to a lack of cooperation from Russia. This has left the organisation struggling with its mandate and to make key decisions such as who will hold future rotating chairmanships.

In addition, there is no mechanism within the OSCE to remove Russia or place limitations on them, meaning the requests for banning Russian officials seem unlikely to be heard.

Court won’t investigate Austrian far-right over Russia ties

The Austrian court of auditors will not pursue the far-right FPÖ over allegations it received money from a Russian spin doctor in 2016 in exchange for introducing a pro-Russian proposal to parliament, citing procedural reasons.

Hacked emails of a “Russian chief propagandist” would show how representatives of the far-right opposition party FPÖ and other right-wing populists became “willing PR tools of Putin” after the annexation of Crimea, research by the magazine Profil[https://www.profil.at/investigativ/moskau-mails-die-fpoe-im-netz-der-kreml-propaganda/402315584] shows.

FPÖ members also discussed money in exchange for pro-Russian proposals presented in parliament and ordered PR articles and visits to Moscow.

Still, due to procedural reasons, the Court of Auditors has decided not to pursue the matter, Spokesman Christian Neuwirth tweeted on Monday.

He was referring to the latest amendment to the Political Parties Act, which allows the court to intervene in cases of “reasonable suspicion”, while the Independent Party Transparency Senate (UPTS) is only allowed to sanction matters after 1 January 2023.

“Already the dissemination of such a suspicion fulfils the elements of the offence of honour insult and credit damage as well as defamation,” said the FPÖ in a statement to APA, rejecting all allegations.

The Independent Party Transparency Senate (UPTS) is an independent authority established by a constitutional provision to impose fines and monetary penalties for violations of certain provisions of the Political Parties Act (at the Federal Chancellery).

An ‘expired’ contract

In 2016, the FPÖ signed a five-year cooperation agreement with Russia’s ruling party United Russia, intending to strengthen political and economic ties between Vienna and Moscow, but is now refusing to disclose it.

Confronted with the pact available to APA, FPÖ Secretary-General Christian Hafenecker said it had “expired”, claiming that the Russia side would also confirm it

The Social Democrat opposition party (SPÖ) insisted on Tuesday that the FPÖ leader Herbert Kickl should “immediately disclose all contracts between the FPÖ and the Putin’s United Russia party” and to voluntarily grant the court of auditors full access to the party’s finances.

“If the FPÖ continues to refuse control, the serious suspicion will only be confirmed,” SPÖ federal Director Christian Deutsch said in a statement, adding that the far-right party has tabled 30 pro-Russian motions in parliament since the start of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.

The OSCE meeting

Austria is already in the spotlight for the upcoming OSCE assembly meeting in Vienna set to take place from 23-24 February, after parliamentarians from 20 OSCE countries urged the government to bar Russian diplomats[https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/austrian-fm-defends-russian-participation-at-osce-meeting/] from attending.

Austrian FM Alexander Schallenberg recently regretted the meeting’s planned date as “a very unfortunate one” but noted that Vienna must allow all delegates from all participating states to enter the country.

New sustainable projects have been announced for refineries in Europe that halted crude processing over the last few years.

** Dutch storage company Vopak, which is acquiring the shares of Gunvor Petroleum Antwerp from commodity trader Gunvor Group, said it will redevelop "sustainably" the site together with the Port of Antwerp-Bruges. The two companies will "focus on joint development and implementation to support renewable energy," and jointly develop a "new green energy hub," they said in a statement Feb. 6. The site, which includes a terminal and the former refinery, which was mothballed in 2020, offers "deepsea, river, road and rail access, as well as pipeline connections to Northwest Europe" with adjacent and future pipelines suitable for transporting propylene, ethylene and hydrogen, the statement said. The refinery stopped crude processing at the end of May 2020.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said, adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

** Finnish refiner Neste reiterated in its 2022 financial report that it had launched a strategic study on transitioning its Porvoo refinery to a renewable and circular site and that it expects to end crude oil refining in the mid-2030s. "Neste will also continue to actively study opportunities of green hydrogen at its Porvoo refinery," it said.

Separately, Neste expects utilization at its renewables production facilities to remain high in 2023, "except for the one-month shutdown at Rotterdam" in Q1, "due to an occurrence of a fire in a process unit in late December." It also said that in Q4 2022 it had both "planned and unplanned" shutdowns at the Rotterdam refinery.

** Meanwhile, the UK government along with industry is investing GBP113 million ($136 million) on hydrogen and electric flight technologies in a new round of funding, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said in a statement. The investment would support light-weight batteries for small aircraft in a project led by Vertical Aerospace, and development of a liquid hydrogen combustion jet engine led by Rolls-Royce, BEIS said.

Government and industry are jointly backing the projects through the Aerospace Technology Institute Programme.

The ATI Programme supported the recent successful test flight of ZeroAvia's hydrogen fuel cell-powered flight in a 19-seater aircraft in January.

In addition, airline Virgin Atlantic is to receive government funding for a first ever 100% sustainable aviation fuel-powered transatlantic flight. The flight from London to New York will take off later this year, BEIS said.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Poland's PKN Orlen said Jan. 20 it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil products loading terminal in Gdansk. PKN said both investments are scheduled to be commissioned by mid-2025. The hydrocracking base oils project will help the company diversify into second- and third-generation base oils.

** The expansion of Orlen Unipetrol's steam cracker at Litvinov is still ongoing, the company said Dec. 2022. The company said in October 2021 it was contracting Technip Energies to build a new steam cracker furnace to be commissioned in 2022. The construction of an 11th furnace is set to boost production capacity to 585,000 mt/year of ethylene from 545,000 mt/year. The company plans to increase total petrochemical production capacity to 1.4 million mt/year by 2030 from 900,000 mt/year.

PKN Orlen has completed the Czech Koruna 9.6 billion ($410 million) polyethylene 3 unit investment at Litvinov. The refinery's owner, Unipetrol, a 100%-owned PKN subsidiary, has taken charge of the black polyethylene unit, the second part of the investment. The first part, the natural polyethylene unit, was completed in April 2020. The polyethylene 3 unit, which can produce 270,000 mt/year of high density polyethylene, will replace production of one of the two existing production units with a capacity of 120,000 mt/year. Litvinov's polyethylene capacity will increase from 320,000 mt/year to 470,000 mt/year. PKN Orlen was launching construction of a unit at Litvinov to produce up to 26,000 mt/year of dicyclopentadiene, or DCPC, used in the automotive, construction and electronic industries. Separately, McDermott International has been awarded a contract for engineering, procurement and construction management services for an upgrade of the hydrocracker at the Litvinov refinery.

** Motor Oil Hellas has approved an investment into a new propylene splitter unit at the Corinth refinery. It will have 100,000 mt annual capacity and is expected to be completed by 2026. It will use the existing infrastructure of the FCC unit which will switch part of the gasoline production into propylene. The splitter is a "significant step" towards diversifying the refinery operations, the company said.

** Croatia's Rijeka refinery halted operations for five months between November 2022 and April 2023 while it continues with its upgrade project. During the shutdown, works will be carried out on "connecting existing units with new systems", the company said. It also clarified that "several suspensions" of operations are planned for the duration of the upgrade project, in which it is investing more than HRK4 billion ($524 million), as "the refinery cannot operate continuously while work is being carried out" on the existing and new units. The upgrade involves construction of a new residue complex, which includes a delayed coker. Works on the new residue complex started in 2020. Commissioning of the new complex is planned for 2024, the company said.

** France's Donges refinery is building a new hydrodesulfurization unit due to start up in the fourth quarter of 2023.

** OMV Petrom will build a new unit for aromatics products at its Petrobrazi refinery. The company said it will invest approximately EUR130 million ($142 million) on the new unit whose processing capacity will be around 1,500 mt/day of reformed gasoline. The existing aromatics unit, which started production in 1961, will be replaced over 2023-2025, and the new unit will be put in operation in 2026. OMV also said it has "successfully completed the transportation of four coke drums." The new drums will replace the current ones, which have been in use since 1989, and will be operational in 2023. The company is also considering other significant investments at Petrobrazi, "both in the technological efficiency of the refinery as well as in the production of second-generation biofuels," the company said.

** Repsol will build a new plant at Tarragona to produce 27,000 mt/year of cross-linkable polyethylene (XLPE) from mid-2024. It will also invest Eur18 million in an upgrade of its polyols unit, due to conclude in Q4 2023.

** Bosnia's Brod refinery has started construction of a bitumen unit. The refinery, which has been offline since 2019 for an upgrade, had been expected to restart once it was connected to a gas pipeline, allowing it to switch to gas-fired power operations. The line was connected in December 2021, but the plant remains offline. The owner has not given a reason why. A solar power facility at the plant has also been built to help power operations.

** Slovakia's Slovnaft is modernizing and expanding polypropylene production at the Bratislava refinery. The capacity of the PP3 unit will increase by 33,000 mt/year to 300,000 mt/year. Construction was expected to start in the summer of 2023 and be completed in October 2024.

** Poland's PKN Orlen has signed a contract with Linde to build a new oxygen and nitrogen production unit at its Plock refinery. The unit will produce 38,500 cu m/hour of oxygen and 75,000 cu m/hour of nitrogen, supplying gas feedstock for the new Olefin III complex and other installations at Plock. The project is due to be completed by the start of 2025.

** A visbreaking unit at PKN's Plock refinery will have a capacity to produce 200,000 mt/year of diesel. Ongoing modernization of the hydrocracking and diesel hydrodesulfurization units at Plock will also increase the refinery's diesel production capacity. Separately, PKN Orlen has bought a license and base design from US engineering company KBR for a potential bottom-of-the-barrel project. If PKN takes a final investment decision, it will construct a production complex using solvent de-asphalting and fluid catalytic cracking technologies.

** Romania's Rompetrol expects the new cogeneration plant at the Petromidia refinery to be online by July 2023. The Kazakh-Romanian Energy Investment Fund, or FIEKR, has raised Eur83 million syndicated credit facility for financing the project, which represents over 65% of the overall investment, estimated at $148 million. In 2020, the fund signed an engineering, procurement and construction contract for Turkey's Calik Enerji to build the cogeneration plant, and in June 2021, it started the execution of the contract. The new facility will be fueled mainly by natural gas and up to 25% by the fuel gas from refining technological processes. Its efficiency will reach 92%. It will have 80 MW capacity, out of which the largest amount will be used to cover Petromidia's electricity needs, and the rest will be used to heat water for the town of Navodari's heating system. In 2020, two other projects were approved which aimed at modernizing the Petromidia refinery. They comprised building a diesel dewaxing unit which will allow the refinery to improve the production of winter diesel and increase the production of special aviation fuel. In addition, the refinery is working on increasing by more than 30% its polymer production by converting the high density polyethylene installation into a polypropylene installation.

** Azerbaijan's state oil company Socar is looking to expand the capacity of its 212,000 b/d Star refinery in Turkey. Socar said it could expand Star's capacity to 13 million mt/year (261,000 b/d) by means of "flexibilities" in the refinery's design.

** PKN Orlen has signed an EPC contract with UK-based Petrofac to build a bottom-of-the-barrel unit at its Mazeikiu refinery in Lithuania. The unit is expected to be completed by the end of 2024 and will allow a rise in the production of high-margin products to 86% of the total, from 73%.

** Turkish construction group Tekfen Insaat said that together with partner HMB Hallesche Mitteldeutsche Bau it has signed an EPC contract with Turkey's main refiner Tupras to construct a new sulfur recovery unit at the Kirikkale refinery. Tupras' upgrade plans for its four refineries include new sulfur units at its three main refineries, Izmit, Izmir and Kirikkale. Tupras is also carrying out a revamp of the FCC unit at Izmit, which will include the installation of flue gas treatment and energy back recovery systems.

** Portugal's Galp will build a desulfurization unit with a processing capacity of 20,000 b/d at the Sines refinery. The project will allow the company to widen its crude slate.

** Greece's Hellenic Petroleum said in 2021 that Eur35 million had been approved for a capacity increase at the polypropylene production unit at Thessaloniki to 300,000 mt/year, with the implementation targeted within 2-1/2 years.

** Israel's Haifa District Court has rejected an appeal by Haifa municipality along with six other neighboring communities and environmental groups against the proposed expansion of the Bazan refinery.

BIOFUEL, HYDROGEN UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** Finland's Neste said in its 2022 financial report that the new renewable products' production capacity in Rotterdam will expand renewable fuels production by 1.3 million mt/year "by the first half of 2026", bringing the total product capacity in Rotterdam to 2.7 million mt/year, with sustainable aviation fuel accounting for 1.2 million mt/year. The new production unit is set to be started up in the first half of 2026.

Separately, the expansion at the Singapore facility has "reached mechanical completion at the end of 2022 and is currently on schedule for start-up by the end of the first quarter 2023," Neste said. The expanded Singapore facility will include "optionality to produce" up to 1 million mt/year of SAF, which together with the Rotterdam project would result in a SAF production capability of 1.5 million mt/year in the beginning of 2024.

After commissioning "the next world-scale renewables refinery in Rotterdam," Neste's total SAF production capability is projected to increase to 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026.

Neste also reiterated that it had established a joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, with the joint operation "targeting to reach full Phase I capacity by the end of the first quarter of 2023."

Neste's current production capacity for renewable products is 3.3 million mt/year which is set to increase to 5.5 million mt/year by the end of 2023 due to the expansion at Singapore and the Martinez joint venture. When completed, the Rotterdam expansion project will further increase the total capacity to 6.8 million mt/year by the end of 2026, S&P Global has reported.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

In Oct. 2021, Gunvor said it had agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Phillips 66 is looking at carbon capture and storage as well as electrolytic green hydrogen production to decarbonize operations at its Humber refinery in the UK, Commercial Manager for Emerging Energy Mike Wailes said Feb. 2023. The initial focus is on post-combustion capture from the refining process, including from the crude topping unit, fluid catalytic cracker and hydro-desulfurization unit, with further more expensive options coming from refueling to use hydrogen, he said.

The refinery is part of the East Coast Cluster industrial decarbonization hub, selected for funding support under the UK government's first phase of CCS cluster sequencing.

Phillips 66 is developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to be powered by offshore wind which can be scalable to 300 MW.

The refinery is the only UK SAF producer, Wailes said.

The Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways in early 2022.

Phillips 66 has said previously its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Portugal's Galp said it expects to sanction key projects in 2023, including 270,000 mt/year production of HVO capacity for producing advanced biodiesel and SAF, with a final investment decision expected in the year. In terms of green hydrogen, it also expects to take FID on a 100 MW Sines hydrogen production plant during 2023, targeting an eventual roll out of up to 700 MW to the end of the decade. The 100-MW Sines electrolyzer project will target to replace existing conventional hydrogen production. Previously, Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Spain's Repsol is to build a new 25,000 mt/year production line for recycled polyethylene at its Puertollano site. The new line, which will produce high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) with a recycled plastic content of 10%-80%, was expected to come into operation by the end of 2024. Current capacity for the plastics production at the site is 16,000 mt/year. Puertollano is also due to start a first polyurethane foam recovery plant this year at Puertollano while it also has plans to build a new unit to produce 15,000 mt/year of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) to come online in 2024 with an investment of Eur105 million.

** Spain's Cepsa and a subsidiary of Spanish gas grid operator Enagas have signed an agreement with PV expert Alter Enersun to jointly develop a 200 MW green hydrogen plant at the Huelva refinery. Output from the plant, which aims to be operational in 2026 will be used to supply Cepsa's own industrial consumption and will enable the manufacture of advanced biofuels. The facility will be powered by a solar PV plant with 200 MW capacity.

Cepsa said earlier it would invest Eur3 billion to develop green hydrogen capacity of 2 GW producing up to 300,000 mt/year of green hydrogen at its two refinery sites at Huelva and nearby Campo de Gibraltar (Algeciras) by 2028. Both refineries produce and consume grey hydrogen, with a consumption of 120,000 mt/year of hydrogen, according to an S&P Global estimate. Huelva produces hydrogen through two steam reforming units and a pressure swing adsorption hydrogen recovery plant, according to company data.

Cepsa has already signed an agreement with the Port of Rotterdam to create the first green hydrogen corridor between southern and northern Europe, allowing the export of green ammonia and methanol.

Separately, Cepsa said in December 2022 it concluded a conversion project at one of its idled units at the Huelva refinery to increase first and second-generation biofuels, which reduce CO2 emissions by 90%. The refurbished desulfurization unit will produce a sustainable diesel known as hydrotreated biodiesel, which is made from vegetable oil, vegetable waste, and animal fats not used for human consumption.

The new unit will initially produce 400 mt/d of hydrotreated biodiesel which can be eventually doubled to 800 mt/d. Cepsa started production of advanced 2G biofuels at the Huelva site in October using cooking oils as feedstock. Cepsa plans to hit annual production of 2.5 million mt of advanced biofuels by 2030, including 800,000 mt/year of sustainable aviation fuel.

** Renewable hydrogen company Everfuel has signed an agreement in Jan. 2023 to supply oxygen to an undisclosed company from its HySynergy electrolyzer in Fredericia, Denmark, enabling a higher utilization of the plant. The conditional agreement will improve the overall utilization and efficiency of the second phase of the electrolyzer, providing a long-term revenue stream, Everfuel said. HySynergy 2.0 will extend the existing 20 MW electrolyzer with 300 MW of additional capacity by 2025. It will be developed with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia and will produce hydrogen to decarbonize industrial processes and transportation. The first 20-MW phase started hydrogen production in December, with first commercial deliveries due in 2023. The plant, adjacent to the Fredericia oil refinery, will supply renewable hydrogen to the facility and for local zero-emissions transport, Everfuel said. The plant will send 80% of the hydrogen produced to the refinery for use as a feedstock in the refining process. The remaining 20% will go to hydrogen mobility applications. Phase two is to be built in three 100-MW stages.

** Neste has received a grant of Eur27.7 million ($29 million) for green hydrogen projects at its Porvoo refinery in Finland, the company said in late December 2022. The funding from Business Finland was approved under the EU's Important Projects of Common European Interest scheme, clearing the way for state support. Neste had said it was targeting a final investment decision in late 2023 for its 'Sustainable Hydrogen and Recovery of Carbon' project at Porvoo. The project includes a 50-MW electrolyzer to produce 8,000 mt/year of renewable hydrogen, along with a carbon capture plant that will capture 300,000-400,000 mt/year of CO2 from the company's existing hydrogen production unit, Neste told S&P Global Commodity Insights. Neste plans to switch around a quarter of its Porvoo hydrogen production to low-carbon sources with these developments, out of annual demand of over 100,000 mt.

Separately Neste said it has launched a study to transition its Porvoo refinery "to non-crude oil refining and into a globally leading renewable and circular solutions site." The transformation could see the end of crude refining at Porvoo in the mid-2030s. Through benefiting from "available refining assets, experience and know-how, Neste targets to significantly grow its renewables and circular production in Porvoo long term," Neste said. The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste will also build a chemical recycling facility at its Porvoo refinery. The project aims to pretreat and upgrade liquefied waste plastic and integrate the technologies into the refinery operations. It targets 400,000 mt/year pretreatment capacities "contributing to Neste's goal of processing over 1 million mt of waste plastic per year from 2030 onward." The investment decision was targeted for 2023 and gradual implementation expected to start in 2024. Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

** Spain's Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for its planned 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

Other projects include a 2,100 mt/year synthetic fuel plant and supporting hydrogen infrastructure to come online from 2024.

A separate plant, costing Eur20 million is contemplated to generate gas to feed the refinery from urban waste and should be online by 2025.

** Piling work for a new biofuel plant being built by Shell at the site of Europe's biggest refinery, Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam (formerly Pernis), was due to be completed around summer 2023, with the new plant expected to start up in 2024 or 2025. Shell is building an 820,000 mt/year biofuel plant in Rotterdam to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste. The facility will not use virgin palm oil as a feedstock although it will process vegetable oils, such as rapeseed, to supplement the waste feedstocks "until even more sustainable advanced feedstocks are widely available," it said.

** Repsol along with Spanish companies Naturgy and Reganosa plan to construct a hydrogen electrolyzer at Meirama, close to the A Coruna plant, with the output used to feed the refinery. The first phase of the project will see 30 MW of installed capacity by 2025 at the site of a closed thermal power plant. A subsequent upgrade will take the project to 200 MW capacity, producing 30,000 mt of green hydrogen per year. A newly installed hydrotreatment unit at Spain's A Coruna that processes vegetable and cooking oils was expected to boost biofuel output by 5,500 mt/year in 2022, with the volume rising to 10,500 mt/year by 2024.

** Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery. The contract covers engineering, procurement and construction assistance for the conversion of Grandpuits "into a zero-crude platform oriented towards SAF," it said. Once in operation, the facility will have the capacity to produce 210,000 mt/year of SAF from sustainable feedstock such as used cooking oil and animal fat. Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in Q1 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform, starting in 2024.

Separately, Air Liquide is to invest over Eur130 million ($134 million) in a low-carbon hydrogen unit at the Grandpuits biorefinery. TotalEnergies has committed to buy the hydrogen under a long-term contract to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The new reforming unit, with capacity to produce over 20,000 mt/year of hydrogen, will partly recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, in place of the natural gas it normally uses.

TotalEnergies also said that its zero-crude project at Grandpuits "is based on the development of several future-oriented activities" which include chemical recycling of plastic waste, production of biosourced and biodegradable bioplastics, production of biofuels for the aviation sector, construction of a solar farm and electricity storage by batteries. The new units will be starting up from 2022 and are expected to be operational by 2025.

** Turkey's Tupras said it had completed basic engineering studies to produce sustainable aviation fuel at its Izmir refinery using Honeywell's UOP ecofining technology. Tupras said it plans eventually to produce 400,000 mt/year of SAF, renewable diesel and other products at Izmir.

** Croatia's INA is studying various options for its Sisak refinery, including a biorefinery, biogas plant and production of pure hydrogen.

** Italy's Eni said it was "investigating the opportunity to build a new bio-refinery at Eni's industrial site in Livorno." It will be Eni's third biorefinery in Italy after converting its Gela and Venice refineries into biofuel plants. Eni said its feasibility study involves building "three new plants for the production of hydrogenated biofuel: a biogenic feedstock pre-treatment unit, a 500,000 mt/year Ecofining plant and a plant for the production of hydrogen from methane gas." The design of the three plants will be completed by 2023 and construction by 2025. Local officials welcomed the potential conversion of the Livorno refinery into a biorefinery as it would maintain "the current workforce and the entire production chain."

** Italy's Eni has started producing SAF at its Taranto refinery in southern Italy, as part of its commitment to decarbonize all its products and processes by 2050. Eni plans to increase its bio-refining capacity to 5 million-6 million mt/year by 2050. Eni targets its SAF capacity to reach at least 500,000 mt/year by 2030. Eni said its SAF production will continue to grow with the start-up of over 10,000 mt/year of SAF from its Livorno refinery using bio-components produced in Eni's existing Gela and Venice bio-refineries. In 2024, Eni plans to launch SAF production at the Gela bio-refinery, where a project is underway for a further 150,000 mt/year of SAF production from 100% renewable raw materials by 2025.

** Italy's Eni said that it will install a 20 MW electrolyzer at its Gela biorefinery and a 10 MW electrolyzer at its Taranto refinery. The electrolyzers will be part of a project to develop green hydrogen by Enel Green Power and Eni which will receive public funding approved by the European Commission.

** Ineos has awarded a design contract for a planned 190,000 mt/year low-carbon hydrogen production plant at its Grangemouth refining and petrochemical site in Scotland to engineering company Atkins. The plant is expected to be operational by 2030.

** Essar, the owner of the UK's Stanlow refinery, said it has received a hydrogen-powered furnace, which is the first in the UK. The furnace has been commissioned by Essar Oil UK "as it transitions to run its operations on hydrogen as part of HyNet, the UK's leading decarbonization cluster," it said. The furnace, which will run on 100% hydrogen fuel from 2026, "forms a central part of Essar's strategy at Stanlow to become the UK's first low-carbon refinery." The furnace will replace three gas-fired furnaces at the plant's crude distillation unit. Essar is also developing 300,000 cu m of biofuel storage capacity at the site, allowing customers to store, blend and distribute biofuels for the road, aviation and marine sectors. It will become the UK's largest biofuels storage facility when completed.

** OMV Petrom will start producing SAF at its Petrobrazi refinery, which will become the first refinery in Romania to produce the fuel. The refinery will produce SAF by coprocessing locally produced rapeseed oil. In the future, it aims to increase the production capacities and produce sustainable fuels based on various waste feedstocks, such as used cooking oil. "Our goal is that, in 2030, to have an annual combined production of SAF and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil) of about 450 thousand tons," Radu Caprau, member of the Executive Board responsible for Refining & Marketing said.

** Repsol and partners Enerkem and Agbar have presented a project to transform 400,000 mt/year of urban waste to 220,000 mt/year methanol at Tarragona, which should start up in 2025 with an investment of Eur250 million. Spain's Tarragona has started on a series of energy transition projects, including the manufacture of biofuel for aviation and an advanced biofuels plant, which is already under construction. The refinery plans to build a 100-MW hydrogen electrolyzer by 2025.

** Hungarian oil and gas group MOL will build a 10-MW electrolyzer for renewable hydrogen production at its Danube refinery in Szazhalombatta, Hungary. The electrolyzers from US company Plug Power will produce 1,600 mt/year of green hydrogen, with operations starting in 2023.

** OMV said that together with AEG Fuels it will supply SAF from its Schwechat refinery on-demand for the "general aviation segment" to be used as an alternative to conventional jet fuel at the Vienna International Airport. SAF is produced at Schwechat by co-processing Austrian used cooking oil and is supplied via a direct pipeline connection to Vienna's international airport. OMV had also supplied the first batch of SAF to Vienna International Airport for fueling Austrian Airlines aircraft. Schwechat has received the two main components for producing SAF -- the reactor and column. From mid-2023 up to 160,000 mt of liquid biomass will be converted into SAF using an innovative co-processing method, it said. "The new reactor will process substances including vegetable oil together with other feedstocks in a procedure known as co-processing. This innovative process involves refining the biogenic feedstock via a hydrogenation process using hydrogen," OMV said. In the future, the process can be used for processing other feedstock such as used cooking oil or advanced bio-fuels. OMV plans to increase its SAF sales to more than 700,000 mt/year by 2030. Separately, OMV will build the country's largest electrolysis plant at the Schwechat refinery through a joint investment with Kommunalkredit Austria AG. The plant is expected to start in H2 2023. The 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis will produce up to 1,500 mt/year of green hydrogen.

** Germany's Bayernoil is looking at producing SAF from sewage sludge. It could convert 100,000 mt of sewage sludge into SAF annually under Project Bayosine. The processing, which involves pyrolisis, can be done in a new unit at the Vohburg site of the plant.

** Sweden's Preem aims to expand the HVO capacity at its Gothenburg plant from 320,000 cu m/year to 1.3 million cu m/year in 2026. "This is planned to take place in a completely new facility designed to produce renewable vehicle fuels and aviation fuels with great flexibility," it said. In its Lysekil plant, production of HVO from the Synsat plant "was the highest to date," the company said. Preem is rebuilding the existing Synsat plant, so it can produce renewable raw materials and replace part of the fossil production. It is expected to reach renewable production capacity of 950,000 cu m/year by 2024.

** Finland's UPM expects its Leuna biorefinery in Germany to be operational by the end of 2023 and ramp up in 2024. Construction of the facility, which will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals, started in 2020. Its total annual capacity will be 220,000 mt bio-monoethylene glycol and lignin-based renewable functional fillers. It will also produce monopropylene glycol and industrial sugars made from sustainably harvested beechwood sourced regionally in Germany.

** Greece's Motor Oil Hellas said its Corinth refinery by 2030 aims to enhance its pure hydrogen infrastructure through demonstration and scale-up of green hydrogen. In the long term, it aims to be a "large producer of clean hydrogen".

** Spain's Castellon will install a 60-MW hydrogen unit for a 2024 start-up with options to expand thereafter, BP Espana said. The start date has been pushed back from a previous 2023 target. The refinery also has plans to triple SAF output to 15,000 b/d as part of an overall decarbonization program, according to press reports.

** France's TotalEnergies said it has "successfully started production" of SAF at its Gonfreville refinery in Normandy. The new site complements the biojet production capacities of the company's La Mede refinery and the Oudalle plant. All the biojet will be supplied to French airports and will be produced from waste and residue sourced from the circular economy. La Mede, in the south of France, and Oudalle, near Le Havre, began producing SAF in April 2021. La Mede stopped processing crude oil at the end of 2016 and was converted into a bio plant in 2019.

** Repsol's Cartagena has started construction of its planned second-generation biofuel plant at the nearby to the refinery Escombreras facility, which should result in the production of 250,000 mt/year of biodiesel from waste from mid-2023. The company will invest Eur200 million in the project that would output biodiesel, biojet, bionaphtha and biopropane, allowing an overall CO2 reduction of 900,000 mt/year. As part of its drive to decarbonize the refinery, Repsol also plans to build a 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer at Cartagena, with a target date of 2025.

** PKN Orlen said its subsidiary Orlen Poludnie has signed an agreement to build a "complex of units for production of II generation bioethanol" at its biofuel refinery in Jedlicze, southern Poland. The B2G complex will include a main unit for bioethanol production and will have the capacity to produce 25,000 mt/year of bioethanol from biomass. In the next stage, a biogas plant will be built. The biomass will be mainly cereals straw sourced from Polish farmers. The bioethanol complex will also include a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant, which will generate heat for bioethanol production. The Jedlicze refinery is a small former petroleum refinery, which together with the Trzebinia refinery, was incorporated into Orlen Poludnie, the company's biofuels subsidiary.

** Poland's PKN Orlen is constructing a hydrogen plant at its Poludnie biorefinery in Trzebinia. Annual production will be 16 million cu m, and three-quarters of that will be used to produce glycol. The remainder will be used to produce 45 kg/h of fuel-grade hydrogen for use in transport.

** Orsted and BP are to jointly develop a 50 MW renewable hydrogen project at BP's Lingen refinery in Germany. The project, expected to be operational in 2024, would comprise a 50 MW electrolyzer capable of generating 9,000 mt/year of hydrogen, 20% of the refinery's current fossil-based hydrogen consumption. The electrolyzer is expected to be powered by an Orsted North Sea offshore wind farm. The partners have a longer-term ambition to build more than 500 MW of renewable hydrogen capacity at Lingen, providing renewable hydrogen to meet all the refinery's hydrogen demand and provide feedstock for future synthetic fuel production.

** Italian energy company Eni and SEA, the operator of Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, have signed an agreement to supply SAF for commercial flights, as a step towards accelerating the "ecological transition" of the two airports. Eni plans to develop Eni Biojet which will be made "exclusively" from used cooking oil or animal fats and can be "used in a blend with conventional jet fuel of up to 50%," Umberto Carrara, Director of Green/Traditional Refining and Market at Eni said. The company plans to produce around 200,000 mt/year by 2024 and double the production by 2030.

** BP has partnered with Dutch green hydrogen company HyCC to develop its 250-MW H2-Fifty electrolyzer project in Rotterdam. The companies will next select a technology partner for the previously announced renewable hydrogen project and begin environmental studies, with a final investment decision expected in 2023. The project is expected to come online in 2025. The renewable hydrogen produced at the facility will replace fossil-based feedstock at BP's Rotterdam refinery and other industries in the area. The plant will be situated in the Maasvlakte area of Rotterdam.

** Russia's Lukoil said in December 2021 that it has signed memorandum of intent with Rusatom Overseas, part of the Rosatom Group, to cooperate in the production and supply of green hydrogen for the company's Petrotel refinery in Ploesti, Romania.

** Varo Energy's Cressier refinery in Switzerland will use solar panel generated electricity by 19,000 photovoltaic panels for a "significant portion" of the electricity it consumes. Varo Energy Group and Groupe E will build the "most powerful ground-mounted solar facility in Switzerland" with an installed capacity of 7.7 MW. It will be built in the industrial zone east of the refinery. At full power the park will be able to supply more than 60% of the refinery's needs.

** ExxonMobil, Macquarie's Green Investment Group, and SGN are studying the potential for a low-carbon hydrogen hub centered around ExxonMobil's Fawley refinery on the UK's south coast. Initial hydrogen production could be around 4.3 TWh/year from 2030. Hydrogen demand in the Southampton industrial cluster around the refinery could reach 37 TWh by 2050.

** Italy's Saras is working on activating a green hydrogen plant for a total of 20 MW. Saras is building the green hydrogen plant with Italian utility Enel. The hydrogen produced would be used at the Sarroch refinery. It is currently provided by the IGCC complex and two reforming units on the industrial site.

** The Refhyne II consortium, developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for Shell's Rheinland refinery in Germany at its Wesseling site, has received a Eur32.4 million grant from the EU. The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Polish refiner PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery. The unit will process used rapeseed oil to produce an additive to diesel or aviation fuel. The annual production of the unit will be 300,000 mt of biodiesel or aviation biofuel. The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies will stop using palm oil at La Mede from 2023. The biorefinery has already significantly reduced the amount of palm oil it processes from 500,000 mt/year initially to 100,000 mt/year in 2021. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

LAUNCHES

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Turkey's Ersan Petrol is still hopeful of its plans for a 1.4 million mt/year refinery at Kahramanmaras in southeast Turkey will be able to go ahead despite repeated delays and a difficult investment climate. Project coordinator Cenk Pala said Ersan was in talks with prospective partners and sources of finance for the project and hopes to start work on the FEED study this year. The refinery is planned for a 300,000 sq m site in Kahramanmaras which holds a defunct mini refinery that will be dismantled. A pre-feasibility study by Axens has defined the configuration and capacity of the plant which will produce mainly Euro 5 diesel, Euro 5 gasoline, jet and bitumen.

** A new greenfield Porto Romano refinery in Albania will be predominantly oriented to export markets but will also be able to cover Albania's domestic demand, Helmut Mayrhofer, consultant at Larkalis said. Austria-based consultancy Larkalis is leading an international consortium working on the project which will involve building the refinery in the port town of Durres. The refinery has a two-year construction authorization and could be commissioned by end-2025, depending on international developments.

** Azeri state oil company Socar is considering developing a second refinery in Turkey, in addition to its existing 214,000 b/d Star refinery at Aliaga on Turkey's central Aegean coast.

Austria opened the door to Russia at an OSCE meeting in Vienna. Ukraine will boycott. We must react

Once again, Austria put the integrity and solidarity of the European Union under duress.

Late last year, its government did so by arbitrarily denying access to Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area.

Now, by inviting Russian deputies who are under EU sanctions and barred from entering the bloc, in order to participate in the meeting of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

The meeting in Vienna is set to be held on 23 and 24 February, exactly one year after the start of Russia's war against Ukraine.

And the 15 Russian Duma members who have been granted visas are not on the EU sanction list by random chance.

They are among those bearing the brunt of responsibility for Russia’s brutal, unprovoked, and unjustified full-scale invasion of its neighbour.

Yet today, Austria is ready to welcome them in Vienna, in an extremely embarrassing move for an EU member state.

Interests and values of the Union are at stake

When it comes to individuals who are placed on the sanctions list, Brussels applies both economic and diplomatic restrictive measures, meaning that the member states are expected to freeze their assets and apply a travel ban.

Any derogation from this principle, even if done by just one member state, is a slap in the face of anyone who believes in European values and their protection.

Russian President Vladimir Putin review the honour guards as he arrives for a meeting with Austrian President Alexander Van Der Bellen in Vienna on 5 June 2018 (AP Photo/Ronald Zak)[https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/40/50/70/808x539_cmsv2_d47cbaa1-8b0b-58c1-be4c-2f3ba18da924-7405070.jpg]

Personally, as a Member of the European Parliament, I feel appalled by Austria’s decision.

It is impossible to stay indifferent and not react when you see an EU member state acting against the interests and values of the Union.

Therefore, today I formally asked the Council of the EU to address this issue, and I sincerely hope it will react as a matter of urgency.

We cannot allow similar incidents to ruin something which was so hard to build and remains so dear to us all: common EU foreign and security policy.

Would you rather sit at the table with Russia or Ukraine?

Austria took the decision to invite the Russian delegation to the OSCE assembly meeting, knowing that it would cause an international outcry.

Several member states have already warned that they could boycott it as a result. And most importantly — Ukraine will.

If the Russian delegation attends OSCE, I think all the rest of the organisation's members will have to boycott as well.

If Austria prefers to sit at the table with Russia and not with Ukraine, I am afraid it will have to face the consequences under the EU legal framework.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shakes hands with OSCE Chairman-In-Office and Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau in Kyiv, 2 August 2022 (AP/Ukrainian Presidential Press Office)[https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/40/50/70/808x532_cmsv2_a51e3225-f178-590b-b56f-f823461a7a34-7405070.jpg]

In my address to the Council, I asked to put into question the voting rights of the representatives of the Austrian government in the EU's strategic and crisis-solving body, as well as its other rights.

This question is inevitable if you consider that Austria, through this move, disregarded EU values listed under Article 2.

Famously, this article has enshrined "values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights"as the Union's most essential tenets.

Providing support to participants in the act of aggression — against the will of the bloc — is at odds with most, if not all, of those.

Possible actions against those found in violation of Article 2 of the Treaty are clearly defined under Article 7 and can lead to the suspension of voting rights, for one.

A meeting in Vienna does not represent extreme circumstances

One could argue that the derogation from the EU sanctions is legitimate and foreseen by the EU legal framework.

To that, I would reply that in this case, we speak about blatant abuse of the derogation procedure, which should be only applied in extreme circumstances, such as for humanitarian aid delivery.

Gathering at a meeting of an organisation — which Russia has continuously disrespected despite its role as the main arbiter on the ground between the occupied territories of Ukraine and Kyiv since 2014 — does not qualify as such.

Flags wave in the wind in front of the entrance of the Permanent Council of the OSCE in Vienna, February 2022 (AP Photo/Lisa Leutner)[https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/40/50/70/808x539_cmsv2_4ad13380-7f10-58d3-9ddb-c41220aab463-7405070.jpg]

On the contrary, it shows a considerable lack of self-respect, bringing Austria's famed neutrality into question as well.

Being neutral, in my view, which I believe is shared by many, does not mean letting someone walk all over you.

That, in turn, makes me wonder about Vienna's motivation for making this decision.

Why open your doors to enemies and close them to friends?

If Austria sent this invitation because it felt pressure from Russia, it would be an alarming sign. If Austria took this decision of its own free will, again, it would also be a very alarming sign.

Under the current framework, a member state which decides to apply a derogation from sanctions should inform the European Commission and all other EU member states of its choice.

Unfortunately, this framework does not foresee any reaction, discussion or assessment of such decisions.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders pose for a photo at the EU summit in Brussels on 9 February 2023 (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)[https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/40/50/70/808x539_cmsv2_5590a003-d18b-5a7f-a0da-8884b19301f6-7405070.jpg]

This is the reason why Austria feels impunity in inviting Russia.

It is also the reason why the Council needs to take a position on that and even consider the revision of the Council Regulation on sanctions against Russia to prevent further “unchecked” and dangerous derogations.

Finally, as a Romanian MEP who went to Bucha and Irpin and saw all the atrocities, who set up a volunteer group to help hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians in distress, who works on the EU budget and tries to do the impossible to confiscate the Russian criminal assets: I simply cannot comprehend how Austria could justify opening its doors to enemies and closing them to friends.

VILNIUS, Feb 21, BNS - Lithuanian representatives will boycott the winter session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna after Austria allowed Russian representatives to attend, Vilija Aleknaite-Abramikiene, head of the Lithuanian Seimas delegation, says.

"The final decision is not to attend. We have waited until yesterday, my suitcase is still ready, hoping that the Austrians will change their decision. They will announce it only today but I have learnt in advance through unofficial channels that they will issue visas to all applicants", she told BNS on Tuesday.

"We have made our minds and we are united, both the position and the opposition, and there are no different views here," the head of the Lithuanian delegation said.

The OSCE PA's winter session in Vienna will take place on Thursday and Friday.

In a joint statement issued after their meeting in Vilnius earlier this month, the Nordic, Baltic and Polish parliamentary delegations said that Russia must be held accountable and responsible for its actions in Ukraine, and that an international legal mechanism should be created to assess the aggressor's crimes.

They noted that Russia's participation in the OSCE PA meeting in Vienna will without doubt be used for propaganda purposes at home and abroad and "will send a very disappointing message to the international community".

Lithuanian invited the Nordic, Baltic and Polish counterparts to join a boycott, if Russia was allowed to attend, but the countries failed to agree on the issue.

Aleknaite-Abramikiene then said representatives of other countries decided to "fight the Russians in the same hall".

All members of the Russian delegation have been on the EU sanction lists for violations of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity since the beginning of 2014.

The OSCE PA session will take place on February 23-24, the anniversary of Russia's war against Ukraine.

The Austrian Foreign Ministry earlier told AFP that the country is "obliged under international law to grant entry to the delegates of all OSCE participating states".

Since the Russian attack on Ukraine in late February 2022, the European Union was quick to respond with sanctions in order to ramp up economic pressure on the Russian government and cripple its ability to finance the war. As the war continues, almost every month a tightening of the sanctions is announced. So far, the EU has enacted eight sanction packages, which include export and import bans of certain products, embargos with regard to Donetsk, Luhansk, Crimea and Sevastopol, asset freezes and prohibitions to make economic funds available to certain listed persons as well as many financial and other transactional restrictions with regard to Russian entities. The Council Regulations are directly binding on all persons under the jurisdiction of EU Member States. For example, regulations imposing freezing measures apply, among others, to EU companies, including financial and credit institutions, doing business in whole or in part in the EU, and to EU nationals.

An ever-changing landscape

Given the rapid and constant changes of the legal framework, navigating the various sanctions has been a challenge for EU companies. At the same time, many Member States have stepped up enforcement of EU sanctions. Austria, for example, has implemented an interagency taskforce that is not only in charge of locating the assets of listed persons but also with the investigation of possible sanctions violations.  Violations of import or export bans as well as embargos are punishable pursuant to Sec 79 of the Foreign Trade Act. Offenders face imprisonment of up to three years, five years if violations are committed on a commercial scale or with the aid of falsified evidence or data. The Sanctions Act, on the other hand, is much broader than the Foreign Trade Act. It applies when no other criminal provision (such as the Foreign Trade Act) provides for stricter sentences and prohibits the violation of directly applicable EU law, i.e. asset freezes and prohibitions to make economic funds available. Offenders can be jailed for up to two years.

Principle of legality

Given the severe consequences of a sanctions violation by EU citizens it does not seem unreasonable to insist that the principle of legality is adhered. This principle implies a need for clarity, predictability and accessibility for criminal prohibitions, limiting current interpretive activities at the EU level, the frequently asked questions "FAQ". Although the FAQ are a helpful tool when working with the EU sanctions, it is often overlooked in practice, that the FAQ are not a legal act, but "a working document drafted by the Commission services in order to help and give guidance to national authorities, EU operators and citizens for the implementation and the interpretation of the EC Council Regulations". Thus, national authorities may not simply rely on the FAQ but have to challenge whether the "interpretation" provided by the Commission is in line with the letter of the law.   

EU sanctions must be enforced in line with the principles of a fair trial, and most importantly in accordance with the principle of legality.

Lithuanian reps at OSCE PA: we've decided not to be in same room with Russian reps

VILNIUS, Feb 22, BNS – Members of the Lithuanian Seimas delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe will not attend the winter session in Vienna because they have decided not to be in the same room with supporters of Russian leader Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine.

"We will not attend the winter session in Vienna this time, and our motive is very simple: we believe that Russia, which has crossed all possible red lines, should not take part in a joint discussion with lawmakers from other countries, all the more so, it's very insulting, both politically and morally, to the Ukrainian delegation," Vilija Aleknaite-Abramikiene, head of the Lithuanian delegation, told a press conference at the Seimas on Wednesday.

Laurynas Kasciunas, a member of the delegation and chair of the parliamentary Committee on National Security and Defense, says Russia's OSCE PA delegation is made up of "Putin's supporters in the Duma, who are contenders for the status of war criminals".

"That's why we have decided not to be in the same room and the same city with them this time", Kasciunas said. "Vienna is now very likely to become a place for the performance and provocations of Duma representatives, and not only by means of speeches, but also by means of press conferences. Apparently, they will try to brag about the fact that they have managed to come, and they can do so, despite the fact that they are all sanctioned. So, we have decided to simply not take part in these games."

Members of the Lithuanian delegation had tried to prevent Russia's representatives from obtaining visas, and had also tried to postpone the Assembly and move it to Vilnius and hold it at the Seimas in March, but to no avail.

"Austria argues that Vienna, like New York and Geneva, is the capital of the organization and that it issues visas to all organizations invited by the Parliamentary Assembly. This is true and we cannot blame the Austrians alone for this situation we are facing," Aleknaite-Abramikiene said.

On Tuesday, Lithuania's representatives said they would boycott the OSCE PA winter session to be held on Thursday and Friday, a year after Russia attacked Ukraine.

In a joint statement issued after their meeting in Vilnius earlier this month, the Nordic, Baltic and Polish parliamentary delegations said that Russia must be held accountable and responsible for its actions in Ukraine, and that an international legal mechanism should be created to assess the aggressor's crimes.

They noted that Russia's participation in the OSCE PA meeting in Vienna will without doubt be used for propaganda purposes at home and abroad and "will send a very disappointing message to the international community".

Lithuanian invited the Nordic, Baltic and Polish counterparts to join a boycott, if Russia was allowed to attend, but the countries failed to agree on the issue.

Aleknaite-Abramikiene then said representatives of other countries decided to "fight the Russians in the same hall".

All members of the Russian delegation have been on the EU sanction lists for violations of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity since the beginning of 2014.

The OSCE PA session will take place on February 23-24, the anniversary of Russia's war against Ukraine.

The Austrian Foreign Ministry earlier told AFP that the country is "obliged under international law to grant entry to the delegates of all OSCE participating states".

Ireland
Russian address of security gathering prompts walkout

Russia has faced a walkout of delegates of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) at its winter gathering in Vienna.

Yesterday's walkout came as the Russian delegation head Pyotr Tolstoy, deputy chairman of the state Duma, began addressing the two-day gathering. Some delegates left the room while others remained, waving Ukraine flags.

Ukraine and Lithuania have boycotted the gathering after Austria issued visas for 18 Russian MPs, six of whom are on EU travel sanction lists, to attend the organisation's winter gathering in the Hofburg palace. "Murderers belong in prison. We are boycotting this gathering because murderers are sitting at the table," said Natalya Pipa, a Ukrainian MP and OSCE delegate who demonstrated outside rather than attend.

Opening address

In a critical opening address, OSCE president Margareta Cederfelt said Russia's warmongering had sent Europe "spiralling into the unknown". Quoting from War and Peace, written by the Russian delegate's great-great-grandfather, she noted Leo Tolstoy's observation "war is so unjust and ugly that all who wage it must try to stifle the voice of conscience within themselves".

"Some in this room have trampled on their mandates," she said. "Some have become promoters of war, murder, and destruction."

Reading the speech of the absent Ukrainian delegation, Slovakian representative Peter Osusky said: "We must not let the warmongers win: not now, not ever."

From provisional base in a nearby hotel, Ukraine's delegation head, Mykyta Poturaiev, said he was not interested in hearing Russian "propaganda".

Because of OSCE rules, a veto by Russia has forced the organisation to end its work in Ukraine. That prompted Mr Poturaiev to demanded an overhaul of OSCE procedures, saying: "If one OSCE member attacks another, they should be suspended."

Even ahead of the winter gathering, which ends today, the OSCE's Russia dilemma has ballooned into a political scandal for Austria.

Foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg said Austria had no legal means - either in its agreements with the Vienna-based OSCE or in international law - to withhold visas from the Russian delegation, though he admitted the date of the event was "most unfortunate ... At the same time, we must not disregard the fact that we need platforms," he told Austria's ORF broadcaster. "The OSCE has never been an organisation of like-minded people."

The organisation was created in 1975, at the height of the cold war by the so-called Helsinki process, which pursued east-west detente and dialogue on issues such as arms control, human rights and press freedom.

Ireland's OSCE ambassador, Anne-Marie Callan, condemned Russia's war on Ukraine and its "appalling brutal and tragic consequences for the country ... We can be in no doubt that the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms is crucial for sustainable peace and security," she told the gathering.

Austrian parliamentary president Wolfgang Sobotka condemned the war but said his country, as OSCE host, had a "duty not to slam the door on diplomacy ... One day the war will end and then dialogue is required," he said.

A number of hydrogen and green ammonia projects have been announced in Europe.

** The UK's Birmingham Airport has partnered with zero-emission aviation company ZeroAvia to start hydrogen-powered flights from the middle of the decade, ZeroAvia said in a statement. ZeroAvia is developing a 20-seat aircraft for commercial flights of 300 nautical miles by 2025, opening up the possibility of the first flights from Birmingham to nearby cities such as Glasgow, Aberdeen, Belfast and Dublin, it said.

ZeroAvia is aiming to expand the range and size of aircraft to up to 700 miles in 40-80 seat aircraft by 2027.

The company is also working with Shell and the Netherlands' Rotterdam The Hague Airport on hydrogen-powered flights, for demonstration flights to European destinations by the end of 2024 and commercial operations by 2025.

It carried out a first test flight on its 19-seater demonstration model in the UK in January.

** Stanlow Terminals will develop a new open-access green ammonia import facility at the Port of Liverpool in northwest England by 2027, as part of Essar's plans to become a major energy transition hub in the region, it said in a statement.

The new terminal will be an expansion of existing facilities, and provide infrastructure to import and store over 1 million mt/year of ammonia, it said.

The ammonia could be sent for onward distribution in the UK, or converted back into hydrogen to supply regional consumers. The terminal will also connect to the 1-GW HyNet low-carbon hydrogen project centered around Essar's Stanlow refinery. Stanlow Terminals is currently undertaking feasibility studies for the ammonia project, with operations scheduled to start in 2027.

** Spain's Cepsa and the ACE Terminal in the Port of Rotterdam have signed a memorandum of understanding on green ammonia imports, the companies said in a statement. Under the MOU, Cepsa will supply green ammonia to the planned import terminal in Rotterdam for conversion back to hydrogen to be used in the industrial sector, or direct application as ammonia in the shipping or other industries, they said. The agreement builds on a separate MOU between Cepsa and the Port of Rotterdam signed in October.

Cepsa is developing 2 GW of renewable hydrogen production at two sites in Andalusia, with a Eur3 million ($3.2 million) investment. The developments form part of the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley.

Gasunie, HES International and Vopak are developing the ACE Terminal for open access green ammonia imports to Netherlands and beyond to continental Europe.

Cepsa aims to start exports of hydrogen and its derivatives from 2027, aligned with the planned start-up of the ACE Terminal, the parties said, adding they planned to move to a binding commercial agreement in the future.

** Arcadia eFuels has awarded a front-end engineering and design contract for its planned 80,000 mt/year synthetic fuels plant in Vordingborg, Denmark, to Technip Energies, the companies said in a statement. The plant will use green hydrogen and captured biogenic CO2 to produce around 55,000 mt/year of "eJet fuel" and 25,000 mt/year of naphtha from 2026, with the possibility of producing diesel too. Construction is planned to start in 2023 and startup of commercial operations by the end of 2024, Arcadia said on its website. The hydrogen will be produced from a 250-MW electrolyzer, powered by renewables.

Biofuel projects also remain in focus for European refiners.

** Italy's Eni reiterated in its Q4 report that in October it launched a study to "assess the economic feasibility of building and operating a biorefinery at the Livorno hub" with a 500,000 mt/year design capacity.

Bio throughput in the fourth quarter fell 35% to 129,000 mt, as lower volumes were processed at Gela and Venice refineries due to a maintenance shutdown, Eni said. In January-December bio throughput was down 18% at 543,000 mt "due to a shutdown that occurred at the Gela biorefinery in the first few months of the year, partly offset by higher throughputs at the Venice biorefinery. Utilization was 50% in the fourth quarter, down from 77% in Q4 2021. Over the whole of 2022, utilization was down at 53% compared to 65%.

It reiterated that in October it "completed the phase-out of palm oil as feedstock supply" for its biorefineries, and fully replaced it with "sustainable raw materials."

Also in October, the first cargo of vegetable oil, produced at Eni's Makueni agri-hub in Kenya, was shipped to the Gela biorefinery where it can be used for the manufacturing of biofuels.

** Refiner Neste and airline Wizz Air have signed a supply deal for 36,000 mt/year of sustainable aviation fuel from 2025, amid ever closer and challenging EU sustainability targets, the companies said. The deal will be for three years, for Wizz Air to use in its European network, the companies said in a statement.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a hydrocracking unit in Orlen Lietuva, Lithuania, a hydrotreated vegetable oils installation and visbreaking unit at Plock and a bioethanol unit at the company's small Polish biofuels plant, Orlen Poludnie.

CONVENTIONAL UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a visbreaking unit at Plock. The visbreaking unit refinery will have a capacity to produce 200,000 mt/year of diesel. Ongoing modernization of the hydrocracking and diesel hydrodesulfurization units at Plock will also increase the refinery's diesel production capacity. Separately, PKN Orlen has bought a license and base design from US engineering company KBR for a potential bottom-of-the-barrel project. If PKN takes a final investment decision, it will construct a production complex using solvent de-asphalting and fluid catalytic cracking technologies.

Separately, PKN Orlen has signed a contract with Linde to build a new oxygen and nitrogen production unit at its Plock refinery. The unit will produce 38,500 cu m/hour of oxygen and 75,000 cu m/hour of nitrogen, supplying gas feedstock for the new Olefin III complex and other installations at Plock. The project is due to be completed by the start of 2025.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Poland's PKN Orlen said it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil products loading terminal in Gdansk. PKN said both investments are scheduled to be commissioned by mid-2025. The hydrocracking base oils project will help the company diversify into second- and third-generation base oils.

** The expansion of Orlen Unipetrol's steam cracker at Litvinov is still ongoing, the company said Dec. 2022. The company said in October 2021 it was contracting Technip Energies to build a new steam cracker furnace to be commissioned in 2022. The construction of an 11th furnace is set to boost production capacity to 585,000 mt/year of ethylene from 545,000 mt/year. The company plans to increase total petrochemical production capacity to 1.4 million mt/year by 2030 from 900,000 mt/year.

PKN Orlen has completed the Czech Koruna 9.6 billion ($410 million) polyethylene 3 unit investment at Litvinov. The refinery's owner, Unipetrol, a 100%-owned PKN subsidiary, has taken charge of the black polyethylene unit, the second part of the investment. The first part, the natural polyethylene unit, was completed in April 2020. The polyethylene 3 unit, which can produce 270,000 mt/year of high density polyethylene, will replace production of one of the two existing production units with a capacity of 120,000 mt/year. Litvinov's polyethylene capacity will increase from 320,000 mt/year to 470,000 mt/year. PKN Orlen was launching construction of a unit at Litvinov to produce up to 26,000 mt/year of dicyclopentadiene, or DCPC, used in the automotive, construction and electronic industries. Separately, McDermott International has been awarded a contract for engineering, procurement and construction management services for an upgrade of the hydrocracker at the Litvinov refinery.

** Motor Oil Hellas has approved an investment into a new propylene splitter unit at the Corinth refinery. It will have 100,000 mt annual capacity and is expected to be completed by 2026. It will use the existing infrastructure of the FCC unit which will switch part of the gasoline production into propylene. The splitter is a "significant step" towards diversifying the refinery operations, the company said.

** Croatia's Rijeka refinery halted operations for five months between November 2022 and April 2023 while it continues with its upgrade project. During the shutdown, works will be carried out on "connecting existing units with new systems", the company said. It also clarified that "several suspensions" of operations are planned for the duration of the upgrade project, in which it is investing more than HRK4 billion ($524 million), as "the refinery cannot operate continuously while work is being carried out" on the existing and new units. The upgrade involves construction of a new residue complex, which includes a delayed coker. Works on the new residue complex started in 2020. Commissioning of the new complex is planned for 2024, the company said.

** France's Donges refinery is building a new hydrodesulfurization unit due to start up in the fourth quarter of 2023.

** OMV Petrom will build a new unit for aromatics products at its Petrobrazi refinery. The company said it will invest approximately EUR130 million ($142 million) on the new unit whose processing capacity will be around 1,500 mt/day of reformed gasoline. The existing aromatics unit, which started production in 1961, will be replaced over 2023-2025, and the new unit will be put in operation in 2026. OMV also said it has "successfully completed the transportation of four coke drums." The new drums will replace the current ones, which have been in use since 1989, and will be operational in 2023. The company is also considering other significant investments at Petrobrazi, "both in the technological efficiency of the refinery as well as in the production of second-generation biofuels," the company said.

** Repsol will build a new plant at Tarragona to produce 27,000 mt/year of cross-linkable polyethylene (XLPE) from mid-2024. It will also invest Eur18 million in an upgrade of its polyols unit, due to conclude in Q4 2023.

** Bosnia's Brod refinery has started construction of a bitumen unit. The refinery, which has been offline since 2019 for an upgrade, had been expected to restart once it was connected to a gas pipeline, allowing it to switch to gas-fired power operations.

BIOFUEL, HYDROGEN UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** Repsol CEO Josu Jon Imaz said Repsol would take a final investment decision in H2 2023 on 350 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity spread across Cartagena, Tarragona and Bilbao, all of which are entering their engineering phase.

** BP is set to announce investment in hydrogen and biofuels production at its Spanish Castellon refinery, financial daily El Economista reported February 2023, citing head of BP in Spain Andres Guevara. Speaking at an event, Guevara said the company would approve investment in a 200 MW hydrogen electrolyzer. BP previously announced the refinery would install a 60 MW hydrogen unit for a 2024 start-up, with options to expand its size to 115 MW thereafter. According to the El Economista report, this could be bumped up to 2 GW of capacity as BP is setting its sights on 5GW overall in Spain.

** Refinery operator Cepsa said it and ammonia producer Fertiberia will raise hydrogen capacity at Huelva to 400 MW by 2026, doubling the 200 MW announced in January 2023. The deal is part of Cepsa's plan to reach a target of 1 GW of capacity by 2030 under its Andalusia Hydrogen Valley project, which encompasses renewable generation and export volume to European consumers.

Once the plant reaches its full 1 GW capacity, hydrogen production should reach 150,000 mt/year. Cepsa agreed in January to jointly develop its first 200 MW green hydrogen plant at Huelva with gas grid operator Enagas and PV expert Alter Enersun. Overall, the company plans to invest Eur3 billion ($3.2 billion) to develop green hydrogen capacity of 2 GW producing up to 300,000 mt/year of green hydrogen at its two refinery sites at Huelva and nearby Campo de Gibraltar (Algeciras) by 2028. Huelva produces hydrogen through two steam reforming units and a pressure swing adsorption hydrogen recovery plant, according to company data.

Cepsa has already signed an agreement with the Port of Rotterdam to create the first green hydrogen corridor between southern and northern Europe, allowing the export of green ammonia and methanol.

Separately, Cepsa said in December 2022 it concluded a conversion project at one of its idled units at the Huelva refinery to increase first and second-generation biofuels, which reduce CO2 emissions by 90%. The refurbished desulfurization unit will produce a sustainable diesel known as hydrotreated biodiesel, which is made from vegetable oil, vegetable waste, and animal fats not used for human consumption.

The new unit will initially produce 400 mt/d of hydrotreated biodiesel which can be eventually doubled to 800 mt/d. Cepsa started production of advanced 2G biofuels at the Huelva site in October using cooking oils as feedstock. Cepsa plans to hit annual production of 2.5 million mt of advanced biofuels by 2030, including 800,000 mt/year of sustainable aviation fuel.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a hydrotreated vegetable oils installation at Plock. PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery. The unit will process used rapeseed oil to produce an additive to diesel or aviation fuel. The annual production of the unit will be 300,000 mt of biodiesel or aviation biofuel. The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a bioethanol unit at the company's small Polish biofuels plant, Orlen Poludnie. PKN Orlen is also constructing a hydrogen plant at its Poludnie biorefinery in Trzebinia. Annual production will be 16 million cu m, and three-quarters of that will be used to produce glycol. The remainder will be used to produce 45 kg/h of fuel-grade hydrogen for use in transport.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Finland's Neste said in its 2022 financial report that the new renewable products' production capacity in Rotterdam will expand renewable fuels production by 1.3 million mt/year "by the first half of 2026", bringing the total product capacity in Rotterdam to 2.7 million mt/year, with sustainable aviation fuel accounting for 1.2 million mt/year. The new production unit is set to be started up in the first half of 2026.

Separately, the expansion at the Singapore facility has "reached mechanical completion at the end of 2022 and is currently on schedule for start-up by the end of the first quarter 2023," Neste said. The expanded Singapore facility will include "optionality to produce" up to 1 million mt/year of SAF, which together with the Rotterdam project would result in a SAF production capability of 1.5 million mt/year in the beginning of 2024.

After commissioning "the next world-scale renewables refinery in Rotterdam," Neste's total SAF production capability is projected to increase to 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026.

Neste also reiterated that it had established a joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, with the joint operation "targeting to reach full Phase I capacity by the end of the first quarter of 2023."

Neste's current production capacity for renewable products is 3.3 million mt/year which is set to increase to 5.5 million mt/year by the end of 2023 due to the expansion at Singapore and the Martinez joint venture. When completed, the Rotterdam expansion project will further increase the total capacity to 6.8 million mt/year by the end of 2026, S&P Global has reported.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

In Oct. 2021, Gunvor said it had agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Phillips 66 is looking at carbon capture and storage as well as electrolytic green hydrogen production to decarbonize operations at its Humber refinery in the UK, Commercial Manager for Emerging Energy Mike Wailes said Feb. 2023. The initial focus is on post-combustion capture from the refining process, including from the crude topping unit, fluid catalytic cracker and hydro-desulfurization unit, with further more expensive options coming from refueling to use hydrogen, he said.

The refinery is part of the East Coast Cluster industrial decarbonization hub, selected for funding support under the UK government's first phase of CCS cluster sequencing.

Phillips 66 is developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to be powered by offshore wind which can be scalable to 300 MW.

The refinery is the only UK SAF producer, Wailes said.

The Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways in early 2022.

Phillips 66 has said previously its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Portugal's Galp said it expects to sanction key projects in 2023, including 270,000 mt/year production of HVO capacity for producing advanced biodiesel and SAF, with a final investment decision expected in the year. In terms of green hydrogen, it also expects to take FID on a 100 MW Sines hydrogen production plant during 2023, targeting an eventual roll out of up to 700 MW to the end of the decade. The 100-MW Sines electrolyzer project will target to replace existing conventional hydrogen production. Previously, Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub.

** Spain's Repsol is to build a new 25,000 mt/year production line for recycled polyethylene at its Puertollano site. The new line, which will produce high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) with a recycled plastic content of 10%-80%, was expected to come into operation by the end of 2024. Current capacity for the plastics production at the site is 16,000 mt/year. Puertollano is also due to start a first polyurethane foam recovery plant this year at Puertollano while it also has plans to build a new unit to produce 15,000 mt/year of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) to come online in 2024 with an investment of Eur105 million.

** Renewable hydrogen company Everfuel has signed an agreement in Jan. 2023 to supply oxygen to an undisclosed company from its HySynergy electrolyzer in Fredericia, Denmark, enabling a higher utilization of the plant. The conditional agreement will improve the overall utilization and efficiency of the second phase of the electrolyzer, providing a long-term revenue stream, Everfuel said. HySynergy 2.0 will extend the existing 20 MW electrolyzer with 300 MW of additional capacity by 2025. It will be developed with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia and will produce hydrogen to decarbonize industrial processes and transportation. The first 20-MW phase started hydrogen production in December, with first commercial deliveries due in 2023. The plant, adjacent to the Fredericia oil refinery, will supply renewable hydrogen to the facility and for local zero-emissions transport, Everfuel said. The plant will send 80% of the hydrogen produced to the refinery for use as a feedstock in the refining process. The remaining 20% will go to hydrogen mobility applications. Phase two is to be built in three 100-MW stages.

** Neste has received a grant of Eur27.7 million ($29 million) for green hydrogen projects at its Porvoo refinery in Finland, the company said in late December 2022. The funding from Business Finland was approved under the EU's Important Projects of Common European Interest scheme, clearing the way for state support. Neste had said it was targeting a final investment decision in late 2023 for its 'Sustainable Hydrogen and Recovery of Carbon' project at Porvoo. The project includes a 50-MW electrolyzer to produce 8,000 mt/year of renewable hydrogen, along with a carbon capture plant that will capture 300,000-400,000 mt/year of CO2 from the company's existing hydrogen production unit, Neste told S&P Global Commodity Insights. Neste plans to switch around a quarter of its Porvoo hydrogen production to low-carbon sources with these developments, out of annual demand of over 100,000 mt.

Separately Neste said it has launched a study to transition its Porvoo refinery "to non-crude oil refining and into a globally leading renewable and circular solutions site." The transformation could see the end of crude refining at Porvoo in the mid-2030s. Through benefiting from "available refining assets, experience and know-how, Neste targets to significantly grow its renewables and circular production in Porvoo long term," Neste said. The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste will also build a chemical recycling facility at its Porvoo refinery. The project aims to pretreat and upgrade liquefied waste plastic and integrate the technologies into the refinery operations. It targets 400,000 mt/year pretreatment capacities "contributing to Neste's goal of processing over 1 million mt of waste plastic per year from 2030 onward." The investment decision was targeted for 2023 and gradual implementation expected to start in 2024. Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

** Spain's Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for its planned 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

Other projects include a 2,100 mt/year synthetic fuel plant and supporting hydrogen infrastructure to come online from 2024.

A separate plant, costing Eur20 million is contemplated to generate gas to feed the refinery from urban waste and should be online by 2025.

** Piling work for a new biofuel plant being built by Shell at the site of Europe's biggest refinery, Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam (formerly Pernis), was due to be completed around summer 2023, with the new plant expected to start up in 2024 or 2025. Shell is building an 820,000 mt/year biofuel plant in Rotterdam to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste. The facility will not use virgin palm oil as a feedstock although it will process vegetable oils, such as rapeseed, to supplement the waste feedstocks "until even more sustainable advanced feedstocks are widely available," it said.

** Repsol along with Spanish companies Naturgy and Reganosa plan to construct a hydrogen electrolyzer at Meirama, close to the A Coruna plant, with the output used to feed the refinery. The first phase of the project will see 30 MW of installed capacity by 2025 at the site of a closed thermal power plant. A subsequent upgrade will take the project to 200 MW capacity, producing 30,000 mt of green hydrogen per year. A newly installed hydrotreatment unit at Spain's A Coruna that processes vegetable and cooking oils was expected to boost biofuel output by 5,500 mt/year in 2022, with the volume rising to 10,500 mt/year by 2024.

** Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery. The contract covers engineering, procurement and construction assistance for the conversion of Grandpuits "into a zero-crude platform oriented towards SAF," it said. Once in operation, the facility will have the capacity to produce 210,000 mt/year of SAF from sustainable feedstock such as used cooking oil and animal fat. Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in Q1 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform, starting in 2024.

Separately, Air Liquide is to invest over Eur130 million ($134 million) in a low-carbon hydrogen unit at the Grandpuits biorefinery. TotalEnergies has committed to buy the hydrogen under a long-term contract to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The new reforming unit, with capacity to produce over 20,000 mt/year of hydrogen, will partly recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, in place of the natural gas it normally uses.

TotalEnergies also said that its zero-crude project at Grandpuits "is based on the development of several future-oriented activities" which include chemical recycling of plastic waste, production of biosourced and biodegradable bioplastics, production of biofuels for the aviation sector, construction of a solar farm and electricity storage by batteries. The new units will be starting up from 2022 and are expected to be operational by 2025.

** Italy's Saras is working on activating a green hydrogen plant for a total of 20 MW. Saras is building the green hydrogen plant with Italian utility Enel. The hydrogen produced would be used at the Sarroch refinery. It is currently provided by the IGCC complex and two reforming units on the industrial site.

** The Refhyne II consortium, developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for Shell's Rheinland refinery in Germany at its Wesseling site, has received a Eur32.4 million grant from the EU. The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies will stop using palm oil at La Mede from 2023. The biorefinery has already significantly reduced the amount of palm oil it processes from 500,000 mt/year initially to 100,000 mt/year in 2021. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen at Gdansk. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

Companies in Europe are reporting progress on upgrades, including conventional and biofuel refineries.

Meanwhile, Spanish refiner Cepsa is to build 375 MW of solar PV capacity in the sun-rich Extremadura region with an investment of Eur262 million ($281 million), it said March 14. Construction for two PV projects in Merida and La Nava de Santiago will start in 2025, it said. Once in operation they will produce 785 GWh/year of electricity, avoiding emissions of 315,000 mt of CO2, it said.

The projects form part of a 7 GW renewable portfolio target by 2030.

Cepsa, like other integrated oil companies, is expanding into renewables to decarbonize its activities.

Separately, Repsol said March 3 it has brought a new outer port area into service that will allow the unloading of larger tankers to supply the A Coruna refinery in northwest Spain. The new jetty can receive ships of 200,000 dwt.

The facility has now received its first cargo at the new 520 meter dock, it said. The Eur126 million project includes a multi-product pipeline, already completed, with 11 underground tubes -- two for transport of crude oil, eight for petroleum products, and one for water drainage. A second phase of the project will see a direct rail link and the eventual transfer of all port activity to the new area by 2027.

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** Romania's Rompetrol said the cogeneration plant at the Petromidia refinery has reached "over 80%" general progress, including "around 95% progress on the engineering side, more than 96% on the procurement side and the actual construction is approaching 72%." The Kazakh-Romanian Energy Investment Fund (KREIF) "has made considerable progress in commissioning the cogeneration plant," the company said March 21. The project, which started in May 2021, will ensure the refinery's energy needs "exclusively from the cogeneration plant," it said. The new facility will generate approximately 80 MW of electricity. The KREIF is owned by KMG International, a subsidiary of Kazakhstan's state-owned KazMunaiGaz, and the Romanian state.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a visbreaking unit at Plock. The visbreaking unit refinery will have a capacity to produce 200,000 mt/year of diesel. Ongoing modernization of the hydrocracking and diesel hydrodesulfurization units at Plock will also increase the refinery's diesel production capacity. Separately, PKN Orlen has bought a license and base design from US engineering company KBR for a potential bottom-of-the-barrel project. If PKN takes a final investment decision, it will construct a production complex using solvent de-asphalting and fluid catalytic cracking technologies.

Separately, PKN Orlen has signed a contract with Linde to build a new oxygen and nitrogen production unit at its Plock refinery. The unit will produce 38,500 cu m/hour of oxygen and 75,000 cu m/hour of nitrogen, supplying gas feedstock for the new Olefin III complex and other installations at Plock. The project is due to be completed by the start of 2025.

** Poland's PKN Orlen said it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil products loading terminal in Gdansk. PKN said both investments are scheduled to be commissioned by mid-2025. The hydrocracking base oils project will help the company diversify into second- and third-generation base oils.

** The expansion of Orlen Unipetrol's steam cracker at Litvinov is still ongoing, the company said Dec. 2022. The company said in October 2021 it was contracting Technip Energies to build a new steam cracker furnace to be commissioned in 2022. The construction of an 11th furnace is set to boost production capacity to 585,000 mt/year of ethylene from 545,000 mt/year. The company plans to increase total petrochemical production capacity to 1.4 million mt/year by 2030 from 900,000 mt/year.

PKN Orlen has completed the Czech Koruna 9.6 billion ($410 million) polyethylene 3 unit investment at Litvinov. The refinery's owner, Unipetrol, a 100%-owned PKN subsidiary, has taken charge of the black polyethylene unit, the second part of the investment. The first part, the natural polyethylene unit, was completed in April 2020. The polyethylene 3 unit, which can produce 270,000 mt/year of high density polyethylene, will replace production of one of the two existing production units with a capacity of 120,000 mt/year. Litvinov's polyethylene capacity will increase from 320,000 mt/year to 470,000 mt/year. PKN Orlen was launching construction of a unit at Litvinov to produce up to 26,000 mt/year of dicyclopentadiene, or DCPC, used in the automotive, construction and electronic industries. Separately, McDermott International has been awarded a contract for engineering, procurement and construction management services for an upgrade of the hydrocracker at the Litvinov refinery.

** Motor Oil Hellas has approved an investment into a new propylene splitter unit at the Corinth refinery. It will have 100,000 mt annual capacity and is expected to be completed by 2026. It will use the existing infrastructure of the FCC unit which will switch part of the gasoline production into propylene. The splitter is a "significant step" towards diversifying the refinery operations, the company said.

** Croatia's Rijeka refinery halted operations for five months between November 2022 and April 2023 while it continues with its upgrade project. During the shutdown, works will be carried out on "connecting existing units with new systems", the company said. It also clarified that "several suspensions" of operations are planned for the duration of the upgrade project, in which it is investing more than HRK4 billion ($524 million), as "the refinery cannot operate continuously while work is being carried out" on the existing and new units. The upgrade involves construction of a new residue complex, which includes a delayed coker. Works on the new residue complex started in 2020. Commissioning of the new complex is planned for 2024, the company said.

** France's Donges refinery is building a new hydrodesulfurization unit due to start up in the fourth quarter of 2023.

** OMV Petrom will build a new unit for aromatics products at its Petrobrazi refinery. The company said it will invest approximately EUR130 million ($142 million) on the new unit whose processing capacity will be around 1,500 mt/day of reformed gasoline. The existing aromatics unit, which started production in 1961, will be replaced over 2023-2025, and the new unit will be put in operation in 2026. OMV also said it has "successfully completed the transportation of four coke drums." The new drums will replace the current ones, which have been in use since 1989, and will be operational in 2023. The company is also considering other significant investments at Petrobrazi, "both in the technological efficiency of the refinery as well as in the production of second-generation biofuels," the company said.

** Repsol will build a new plant at Tarragona to produce 27,000 mt/year of cross-linkable polyethylene (XLPE) from mid-2024. It will also invest Eur18 million in an upgrade of its polyols unit, due to conclude in Q4 2023.

** Bosnia's Brod refinery has started construction of a bitumen unit. The refinery, which has been offline since 2019 for an upgrade, had been expected to restart once it was connected to a gas pipeline, allowing it to switch to gas-fired power operations. The line was connected in December 2021, but the plant remains offline. The owner has not given a reason why. A solar power facility at the plant has also been built to help power operations.

** Slovakia's Slovnaft is modernizing and expanding polypropylene production at the Bratislava refinery. The capacity of the PP3 unit will increase by 33,000 mt/year to 300,000 mt/year. Construction was expected to start in the summer of 2023 and be completed in October 2024.

** Azerbaijan's state oil company Socar is looking to expand the capacity of its 212,000 b/d Star refinery in Turkey. Socar said it could expand Star's capacity to 13 million mt/year (261,000 b/d) by means of "flexibilities" in the refinery's design.

** PKN Orlen has signed an EPC contract with UK-based Petrofac to build a bottom-of-the-barrel unit at its Mazeikiu refinery in Lithuania. The unit is expected to be completed by the end of 2024 and will allow a rise in the production of high-margin products to 86% of the total, from 73%.

** Turkish construction group Tekfen Insaat said that together with partner HMB Hallesche Mitteldeutsche Bau it has signed an EPC contract with Turkey's main refiner Tupras to construct a new sulfur recovery unit at the Kirikkale refinery. Tupras' upgrade plans for its four refineries include new sulfur units at its three main refineries, Izmit, Izmir and Kirikkale. Tupras is also carrying out a revamp of the FCC unit at Izmit, which will include the installation of flue gas treatment and energy back recovery systems.

** Portugal's Galp will build a desulfurization unit with a processing capacity of 20,000 b/d at the Sines refinery. The project will allow the company to widen its crude slate.

** Greece's Hellenic Petroleum said in 2021 that Eur35 million had been approved for a capacity increase at the polypropylene production unit at Thessaloniki to 300,000 mt/year, with the implementation targeted within 2-1/2 years.

** Serbia's Pancevo refinery expects to complete its FCC project in 2023. The refinery also plans to build a unit to produce the octane enhancement chemical ETBE by 2024.

** Bulgaria's Burgas refinery has awarded a contract to US Lummus Technology for a 280,000 mt/year polypropylene plant. The deal includes a technology license as well as basic design engineering, training and services, and catalyst supply.

** ExxonMobil said it has "made a final investment decision to expand" the Fawley refinery in the UK to increase production of ultra low sulfur diesel by 45%, or 38,000 b/d. The more than $1 billion investment includes a hydrotreater to remove sulfur from diesel, supported by a hydrogen plant.

** Israel's Haifa District Court has rejected an appeal by Haifa municipality along with six other neighboring communities and environmental groups against the proposed expansion of the Bazan refinery.

BIOFUEL, HYDROGEN UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** Cepsa said March 8 it will build a new unit to produce second generation biofuel at the Huelva refinery with an investment of Eur1 billion ($1.1 billion). The plant will produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, creating 1,600 jobs, Cepsa said. The biofuels will be produced from organic waste, including used cooking oil and agricultural residues.

The plant will contribute to Cepsa's strategy to reach 2.5 million mt/year of biofuel production by 2030, making it a leader in the Iberian peninsula. The total will include 800,000 mt/year of SAF.

Cepsa started production of advanced 2G biofuels at the Huelva site in October, using cooking oils as feedstock, reducing emissions by 80%. It also concluded a conversion project of an idled unit in December 2022 to produce 400 mt per day of hydrotreated biodiesel, which can be eventually doubled to 800 mt/day.

The refinery is also planning to start up 400 MW of hydrogen production capacity by 2026, having signed agreements in January and February 2023 with local partners.

Cepsa has already signed an agreement with the Port of Rotterdam to create the first green hydrogen corridor between southern and northern Europe, allowing the export of green ammonia and methanol.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Repsol CEO Josu Jon Imaz said Repsol would take a final investment decision in H2 2023 on 350 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity spread across Cartagena, Tarragona and Bilbao, all of which are entering their engineering phase.

** BP is set to announce investment in hydrogen and biofuels production at its Spanish Castellon refinery, financial daily El Economista reported February 2023, citing head of BP in Spain Andres Guevara. Speaking at an event, Guevara said the company would approve investment in a 200 MW hydrogen electrolyzer. BP previously announced the refinery would install a 60 MW hydrogen unit for a 2024 start-up, with options to expand its size to 115 MW thereafter. According to the El Economista report, this could be bumped up to 2 GW of capacity as BP is setting its sights on 5GW overall in Spain.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a hydrotreated vegetable oils installation at Plock. PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery. The unit will process used rapeseed oil to produce an additive to diesel or aviation fuel. The annual production of the unit will be 300,000 mt of biodiesel or aviation biofuel. The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a bioethanol unit at the company's small Polish biofuels plant, Orlen Poludnie. PKN Orlen is also constructing a hydrogen plant at its Poludnie biorefinery in Trzebinia. Annual production will be 16 million cu m, and three-quarters of that will be used to produce glycol. The remainder will be used to produce 45 kg/h of fuel-grade hydrogen for use in transport.

** Finland's Neste said in its 2022 financial report that the new renewable products' production capacity in Rotterdam will expand renewable fuels production by 1.3 million mt/year "by the first half of 2026", bringing the total product capacity in Rotterdam to 2.7 million mt/year, with sustainable aviation fuel accounting for 1.2 million mt/year. The new production unit is set to be started up in the first half of 2026.

Separately, the expansion at the Singapore facility has "reached mechanical completion at the end of 2022 and is currently on schedule for start-up by the end of the first quarter 2023," Neste said. The expanded Singapore facility will include "optionality to produce" up to 1 million mt/year of SAF, which together with the Rotterdam project would result in a SAF production capability of 1.5 million mt/year in the beginning of 2024.

After commissioning "the next world-scale renewables refinery in Rotterdam," Neste's total SAF production capability is projected to increase to 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026.

Neste also reiterated that it had established a joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, with the joint operation "targeting to reach full Phase I capacity by the end of the first quarter of 2023."

Neste's current production capacity for renewable products is 3.3 million mt/year which is set to increase to 5.5 million mt/year by the end of 2023 due to the expansion at Singapore and the Martinez joint venture. When completed, the Rotterdam expansion project will further increase the total capacity to 6.8 million mt/year by the end of 2026, S&P Global has reported.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

In Oct. 2021, Gunvor said it had agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Phillips 66 is looking at carbon capture and storage as well as electrolytic green hydrogen production to decarbonize operations at its Humber refinery in the UK, Commercial Manager for Emerging Energy Mike Wailes said Feb. 2023. The initial focus is on post-combustion capture from the refining process, including from the crude topping unit, fluid catalytic cracker and hydro-desulfurization unit, with further more expensive options coming from refueling to use hydrogen, he said.

The refinery is part of the East Coast Cluster industrial decarbonization hub, selected for funding support under the UK government's first phase of CCS cluster sequencing.

Phillips 66 is developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to be powered by offshore wind which can be scalable to 300 MW.

The refinery is the only UK SAF producer, Wailes said.

The Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways in early 2022.

Phillips 66 has said previously its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Portugal's Galp said it expects to sanction key projects in 2023, including 270,000 mt/year production of HVO capacity for producing advanced biodiesel and SAF, with a final investment decision expected in the year. In terms of green hydrogen, it also expects to take FID on a 100 MW Sines hydrogen production plant during 2023, targeting an eventual roll out of up to 700 MW to the end of the decade. The 100-MW Sines electrolyzer project will target to replace existing conventional hydrogen production. Previously, Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub.

** Spain's Repsol is to build a new 25,000 mt/year production line for recycled polyethylene at its Puertollano site. The new line, which will produce high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) with a recycled plastic content of 10%-80%, was expected to come into operation by the end of 2024. Current capacity for the plastics production at the site is 16,000 mt/year. Puertollano is also due to start a first polyurethane foam recovery plant this year at Puertollano while it also has plans to build a new unit to produce 15,000 mt/year of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) to come online in 2024 with an investment of Eur105 million.

** Renewable hydrogen company Everfuel has signed an agreement in Jan. 2023 to supply oxygen to an undisclosed company from its HySynergy electrolyzer in Fredericia, Denmark, enabling a higher utilization of the plant. The conditional agreement will improve the overall utilization and efficiency of the second phase of the electrolyzer, providing a long-term revenue stream, Everfuel said. HySynergy 2.0 will extend the existing 20 MW electrolyzer with 300 MW of additional capacity by 2025. It will be developed with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia and will produce hydrogen to decarbonize industrial processes and transportation. The first 20-MW phase started hydrogen production in December, with first commercial deliveries due in 2023. The plant, adjacent to the Fredericia oil refinery, will supply renewable hydrogen to the facility and for local zero-emissions transport, Everfuel said. The plant will send 80% of the hydrogen produced to the refinery for use as a feedstock in the refining process. The remaining 20% will go to hydrogen mobility applications. Phase two is to be built in three 100-MW stages.

** Neste has received a grant of Eur27.7 million ($29 million) for green hydrogen projects at its Porvoo refinery in Finland, the company said in late December 2022. The funding from Business Finland was approved under the EU's Important Projects of Common European Interest scheme, clearing the way for state support. Neste had said it was targeting a final investment decision in late 2023 for its 'Sustainable Hydrogen and Recovery of Carbon' project at Porvoo. The project includes a 50-MW electrolyzer to produce 8,000 mt/year of renewable hydrogen, along with a carbon capture plant that will capture 300,000-400,000 mt/year of CO2 from the company's existing hydrogen production unit, Neste told S&P Global Commodity Insights. Neste plans to switch around a quarter of its Porvoo hydrogen production to low-carbon sources with these developments, out of annual demand of over 100,000 mt.

Separately Neste said it has launched a study to transition its Porvoo refinery "to non-crude oil refining and into a globally leading renewable and circular solutions site." The transformation could see the end of crude refining at Porvoo in the mid-2030s. Through benefiting from "available refining assets, experience and know-how, Neste targets to significantly grow its renewables and circular production in Porvoo long term," Neste said. The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste will also build a chemical recycling facility at its Porvoo refinery. The project aims to pretreat and upgrade liquefied waste plastic and integrate the technologies into the refinery operations. It targets 400,000 mt/year pretreatment capacities "contributing to Neste's goal of processing over 1 million mt of waste plastic per year from 2030 onward." The investment decision was targeted for 2023 and gradual implementation expected to start in 2024. Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

** Spain's Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for its planned 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

Other projects include a 2,100 mt/year synthetic fuel plant and supporting hydrogen infrastructure to come online from 2024.

A separate plant, costing Eur20 million is contemplated to generate gas to feed the refinery from urban waste and should be online by 2025.

** Piling work for a new biofuel plant being built by Shell at the site of Europe's biggest refinery, Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam (formerly Pernis), was due to be completed around summer 2023, with the new plant expected to start up in 2024 or 2025. Shell is building an 820,000 mt/year biofuel plant in Rotterdam to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste. The facility will not use virgin palm oil as a feedstock although it will process vegetable oils, such as rapeseed, to supplement the waste feedstocks "until even more sustainable advanced feedstocks are widely available," it said.

** Repsol along with Spanish companies Naturgy and Reganosa plan to construct a hydrogen electrolyzer at Meirama, close to the A Coruna plant, with the output used to feed the refinery. The first phase of the project will see 30 MW of installed capacity by 2025 at the site of a closed thermal power plant. A subsequent upgrade will take the project to 200 MW capacity, producing 30,000 mt of green hydrogen per year. A newly installed hydrotreatment unit at Spain's A Coruna that processes vegetable and cooking oils was expected to boost biofuel output by 5,500 mt/year in 2022, with the volume rising to 10,500 mt/year by 2024.

** Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery. The contract covers engineering, procurement and construction assistance for the conversion of Grandpuits "into a zero-crude platform oriented towards SAF," it said. Once in operation, the facility will have the capacity to produce 210,000 mt/year of SAF from sustainable feedstock such as used cooking oil and animal fat. Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in Q1 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform, starting in 2024.

Separately, Air Liquide is to invest over Eur130 million ($134 million) in a low-carbon hydrogen unit at the Grandpuits biorefinery. TotalEnergies has committed to buy the hydrogen under a long-term contract to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The new reforming unit, with capacity to produce over 20,000 mt/year of hydrogen, will partly recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, in place of the natural gas it normally uses.

TotalEnergies also said that its zero-crude project at Grandpuits "is based on the development of several future-oriented activities" which include chemical recycling of plastic waste, production of biosourced and biodegradable bioplastics, production of biofuels for the aviation sector, construction of a solar farm and electricity storage by batteries. The new units will be starting up from 2022 and are expected to be operational by 2025.

** Turkey's Tupras said it had completed basic engineering studies to produce sustainable aviation fuel at its Izmir refinery using Honeywell's UOP ecofining technology. Tupras said it plans eventually to produce 400,000 mt/year of SAF, renewable diesel and other products at Izmir.

** Croatia's INA is studying various options for its Sisak refinery, including a biorefinery, biogas plant and production of pure hydrogen.

** Italy's Eni said it was "investigating the opportunity to build a new bio-refinery at Eni's industrial site in Livorno." It will be Eni's third biorefinery in Italy after converting its Gela and Venice refineries into biofuel plants. Eni said its feasibility study involves building "three new plants for the production of hydrogenated biofuel: a biogenic feedstock pre-treatment unit, a 500,000 mt/year Ecofining plant and a plant for the production of hydrogen from methane gas." The design of the three plants will be completed by 2023 and construction by 2025. Local officials welcomed the potential conversion of the Livorno refinery into a biorefinery as it would maintain "the current workforce and the entire production chain."

** Italy's Eni has started producing SAF at its Taranto refinery in southern Italy, as part of its commitment to decarbonize all its products and processes by 2050. Eni plans to increase its bio-refining capacity to 5 million-6 million mt/year by 2050. Eni targets its SAF capacity to reach at least 500,000 mt/year by 2030. Eni said its SAF production will continue to grow with the start-up of over 10,000 mt/year of SAF from its Livorno refinery using bio-components produced in Eni's existing Gela and Venice bio-refineries. In 2024, Eni plans to launch SAF production at the Gela bio-refinery, where a project is underway for a further 150,000 mt/year of SAF production from 100% renewable raw materials by 2025.

** Italy's Eni said that it will install a 20 MW electrolyzer at its Gela biorefinery and a 10 MW electrolyzer at its Taranto refinery. The electrolyzers will be part of a project to develop green hydrogen by Enel Green Power and Eni which will receive public funding approved by the European Commission.

** Essar, the owner of the UK's Stanlow refinery, said it has received a hydrogen-powered furnace, which is the first in the UK. The furnace has been commissioned by Essar Oil UK "as it transitions to run its operations on hydrogen as part of HyNet, the UK's leading decarbonization cluster," it said. The furnace, which will run on 100% hydrogen fuel from 2026, "forms a central part of Essar's strategy at Stanlow to become the UK's first low-carbon refinery." The furnace will replace three gas-fired furnaces at the plant's crude distillation unit. Essar is also developing 300,000 cu m of biofuel storage capacity at the site, allowing customers to store, blend and distribute biofuels for the road, aviation and marine sectors. It will become the UK's largest biofuels storage facility when completed.

** OMV Petrom will start producing SAF at its Petrobrazi refinery, which will become the first refinery in Romania to produce the fuel. The refinery will produce SAF by coprocessing locally produced rapeseed oil. In the future, it aims to increase the production capacities and produce sustainable fuels based on various waste feedstocks, such as used cooking oil. "Our goal is that, in 2030, to have an annual combined production of SAF and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil) of about 450 thousand tons," Radu Caprau, member of the Executive Board responsible for Refining & Marketing said.

** Repsol and partners Enerkem and Agbar have presented a project to transform 400,000 mt/year of urban waste to 220,000 mt/year methanol at Tarragona, which should start up in 2025 with an investment of Eur250 million.

The refinery plans to build a 100-MW hydrogen electrolyzer by 2025.

** Hungarian oil and gas group MOL will build a 10-MW electrolyzer for renewable hydrogen production at its Danube refinery in Szazhalombatta, Hungary. The electrolyzers from US company Plug Power will produce 1,600 mt/year of green hydrogen, with operations starting in 2023.

** OMV said that together with AEG Fuels it will supply SAF from its Schwechat refinery on-demand for the "general aviation segment" to be used as an alternative to conventional jet fuel at the Vienna International Airport. SAF is produced at Schwechat by co-processing Austrian used cooking oil and is supplied via a direct pipeline connection to Vienna's international airport. OMV had also supplied the first batch of SAF to Vienna International Airport for fueling Austrian Airlines aircraft. Schwechat has received the two main components for producing SAF -- the reactor and column. From mid-2023 up to 160,000 mt of liquid biomass will be converted into SAF using an innovative co-processing method, it said. "The new reactor will process substances including vegetable oil together with other feedstocks in a procedure known as co-processing. This innovative process involves refining the biogenic feedstock via a hydrogenation process using hydrogen," OMV said. In the future, the process can be used for processing other feedstock such as used cooking oil or advanced bio-fuels. OMV plans to increase its SAF sales to more than 700,000 mt/year by 2030. Separately, OMV will build the country's largest electrolysis plant at the Schwechat refinery through a joint investment with Kommunalkredit Austria AG. The plant is expected to start in H2 2023. The 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis will produce up to 1,500 mt/year of green hydrogen.

** Germany's Bayernoil is looking at producing SAF from sewage sludge. It could convert 100,000 mt of sewage sludge into SAF annually under Project Bayosine. The processing, which involves pyrolisis, can be done in a new unit at the Vohburg site of the plant.

** Sweden's Preem aims to expand the HVO capacity at its Gothenburg plant from 320,000 cu m/year to 1.3 million cu m/year in 2026. "This is planned to take place in a completely new facility designed to produce renewable vehicle fuels and aviation fuels with great flexibility," it said. In its Lysekil plant, production of HVO from the Synsat plant "was the highest to date," the company said. Preem is rebuilding the existing Synsat plant, so it can produce renewable raw materials and replace part of the fossil production. It is expected to reach renewable production capacity of 950,000 cu m/year by 2024.

** Finland's UPM expects its Leuna biorefinery in Germany to be operational by the end of 2023 and ramp up in 2024.

** Spain's Castellon will install a 60-MW hydrogen unit for a 2024 start-up with options to expand thereafter, BP Espana said. The start date has been pushed back from a previous 2023 target. The refinery also has plans to triple SAF output to 15,000 b/d as part of an overall decarbonization program, according to press reports.

** France's TotalEnergies said it has "successfully started production" of SAF at its Gonfreville refinery in Normandy. The new site complements the biojet production capacities of the company's La Mede refinery and the Oudalle plant. All the biojet will be supplied to French airports and will be produced from waste and residue sourced from the circular economy. La Mede, in the south of France, and Oudalle, near Le Havre, began producing SAF in April 2021. La Mede stopped processing crude oil at the end of 2016 and was converted into a bio plant in 2019.

** Repsol's Cartagena has started construction of its planned second-generation biofuel plant at the nearby to the refinery Escombreras facility, which should result in the production of 250,000 mt/year of biodiesel from waste from mid-2023. The company will invest Eur200 million in the project that would output biodiesel, biojet, bionaphtha and biopropane, allowing an overall CO2 reduction of 900,000 mt/year. As part of its drive to decarbonize the refinery, Repsol also plans to build a 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer at Cartagena, with a target date of 2025.

** PKN Orlen said its subsidiary Orlen Poludnie has signed an agreement to build a "complex of units for production of II generation bioethanol" at its biofuel refinery in Jedlicze, southern Poland. The B2G complex will include a main unit for bioethanol production and will have the capacity to produce 25,000 mt/year of bioethanol from biomass. In the next stage, a biogas plant will be built. The biomass will be mainly cereals straw sourced from Polish farmers. The bioethanol complex will also include a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant, which will generate heat for bioethanol production. The Jedlicze refinery is a small former petroleum refinery, which together with the Trzebinia refinery, was incorporated into Orlen Poludnie, the company's biofuels subsidiary.

** Orsted and BP are to jointly develop a 50 MW renewable hydrogen project at BP's Lingen refinery in Germany. The project, expected to be operational in 2024, would comprise a 50 MW electrolyzer capable of generating 9,000 mt/year of hydrogen, 20% of the refinery's current fossil-based hydrogen consumption. The electrolyzer is expected to be powered by an Orsted North Sea offshore wind farm. The partners have a longer-term ambition to build more than 500 MW of renewable hydrogen capacity at Lingen, providing renewable hydrogen to meet all the refinery's hydrogen demand and provide feedstock for future synthetic fuel production.

** Italian energy company Eni and SEA, the operator of Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, have signed an agreement to supply SAF for commercial flights, as a step towards accelerating the "ecological transition" of the two airports. Eni plans to develop Eni Biojet which will be made "exclusively" from used cooking oil or animal fats and can be "used in a blend with conventional jet fuel of up to 50%," Umberto Carrara, Director of Green/Traditional Refining and Market at Eni said. The company plans to produce around 200,000 mt/year by 2024 and double the production by 2030.

** BP has partnered with Dutch green hydrogen company HyCC to develop its 250-MW H2-Fifty electrolyzer project in Rotterdam. The companies will next select a technology partner for the previously announced renewable hydrogen project and begin environmental studies, with a final investment decision expected in 2023.

** Varo Energy's Cressier refinery in Switzerland will use solar panel generated electricity by 19,000 photovoltaic panels for a "significant portion" of the electricity it consumes. Varo Energy Group and Groupe E will build the "most powerful ground-mounted solar facility in Switzerland" with an installed capacity of 7.7 MW. It will be built in the industrial zone east of the refinery. At full power the park will be able to supply more than 60% of the refinery's needs.

** ExxonMobil, Macquarie's Green Investment Group, and SGN are studying the potential for a low-carbon hydrogen hub centered around ExxonMobil's Fawley refinery on the UK's south coast. Initial hydrogen production could be around 4.3 TWh/year from 2030. Hydrogen demand in the Southampton industrial cluster around the refinery could reach 37 TWh by 2050.

** Italy's Saras is working on activating a green hydrogen plant for a total of 20 MW. Saras is building the green hydrogen plant with Italian utility Enel. The hydrogen produced would be used at the Sarroch refinery. It is currently provided by the IGCC complex and two reforming units on the industrial site.

** The Refhyne II consortium, developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for Shell's Rheinland refinery in Germany at its Wesseling site, has received a Eur32.4 million grant from the EU. The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies will stop using palm oil at La Mede from 2023. The biorefinery has already significantly reduced the amount of palm oil it processes from 500,000 mt/year initially to 100,000 mt/year in 2021. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen at Gdansk. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery.

The European Central Bank (ECB) is pressing Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) to quit its Russian business, Reuters reported citing unnamed sources.

As covered by bne IntelliNews, RBI is coming under increased secondary sanction pressure from the US for maintaining a lucrative Russian presence as one of the banking sector’s systemic banks, one year into the full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.

Reuters sources also claimed that a top US sanction official had travelled to Vienna to raise concerns about Austria’s second-biggest bank’s business in Russia.

Reportedly, the ECB is pursuing a softer approach. The regulator is not demanding that RBI quit immediately, but wants to see a plan of action for unwinding its business, which could include the sale or closure of its Russian bank. Such a careful approach is said to be linked to fears of further banking turmoil in case RBI gets hit hard financially.

"We have been asking banks to keep closely monitoring the business in Russia, and ideally, reduce it and wind it down as much as possible," a spokesperson for the ECB said, as cited by Reuters, adding it had been doing the same with all institutions concerned since Moscow launched its full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.

A Raiffeisen spokesperson told Reuters that it was examining options for its Russia business, "including a carefully managed exit", and that it was "expediting" its assessment, adding that it had also reduced lending in the country.

As for the pressure from the US, RBI said that it was in the "early stages" of collecting information to respond to the inquiry letter from the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

Most recent reports suggested that RBI is planning to swap €400mn worth of profits trapped in Russia for the blocked European funds of Russian state-controlled bank Sberbank. The swap deal is likely to raise eyebrows and further deepen suspicions that RBI is actively co-operating with Russian authorities and regulators, while intending to repatriate funds for the sanctioned Sberbank.

Raiffeisen, Italy's UniCredit and Citi of the US are among dozens of banks from “unfriendly” countries that remain unable to exit the Russian market due to the special decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin prohibiting any such deals without the special approval by authorities.

The only bank that managed to quickly pull out of Russia following the full-scale military invasion of Ukraine was France's Societe Generale, which sold its fully-owned Rosbank to oligarch Vladimir Potanin.

Citi is winding down its business and reportedly is exploring various options of pulling out of Russia but does not want to “simply give the asset away”. UniCredit bank has so far managed to offload its loan book to local UralSib bank.

European companies reported progress with conventional and hydrogen upgrades.

Slovakia's Slovnaft has awarded an engineering, procurement services and construction management (EPSCM) contract for an off-gas upgrade at its Bratislava steam cracker to McDermott. The Slovnaft refinery, in addition to oil processing and fuel production, produces basic plastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene. The ethylene unit is key to the company's petrochemical segment.

Separately, Sunfire has installed the world's first multi-megawatt high-temperature electrolyzer for production of green hydrogen at Neste's biofuels refinery in Rotterdam, the German electrolysis company said. The 2.6-MW MultiPLHY project, now commissioning, comprises 12 solid oxide electrolysis cell modules at the refinery operating at 850 degrees Celsius. Once operational it will produce over 60 kg/hour of renewable hydrogen. "Utilizing industrial excess heat, the electrolyzer processes steam to hydrogen with the highest conversion efficiency. Compared to other electrolysis solutions, Sunfire's SOEC technology is the most efficient on the market because the high-temperature process significantly reduces the amount of electricity required," the company said.

BP plans to invest up to Eur2 billion in a green hydrogen plant at Spanish Castellon to replace the existing fossil-based hydrogen plant, it said in February 2023. Under the project, BP said it plans a phased development of up to 2 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030.

Separately, Axens said it has acquired stakes in the BioTJet project, which aims to build the largest SAF production unit "using the Fischer-Tropsch process." It will be built in France and started up by 2027, with a final investment decision expected at the end of 2024. The project will "make it possible to process a broad spectrum of lignocellulosic biomasses, which do not compete with food uses," it said.

CONVENTIONAL UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** Slovakia's Slovnaft has awarded an engineering, procurement services and construction management (EPSCM) contract for an off-gas upgrade at its Bratislava steam cracker to McDermott. The project will upgrade the existing steam cracker unit by adding a low-pressure recovery unit, increasing ethylene production capacity utilizing the off-gas from the existing production, McDermott said in a statement.

Following the expansion, the capacity of the PP3 unit will increase by 33,000 mt/year to 300,000 mt/year. Construction was expected to start in the summer of 2023 and be completed in October 2024.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Romania's Rompetrol said the cogeneration plant at the Petromidia refinery has reached "over 80%" general progress, including "around 95% progress on the engineering side, more than 96% on the procurement side and the actual construction is approaching 72%." The Kazakh-Romanian Energy Investment Fund (KREIF) "has made considerable progress in commissioning the cogeneration plant," the company said in March 2023. The project, which started in May 2021, will ensure the refinery's energy needs "exclusively from the cogeneration plant," it said. The new facility will generate approximately 80 MW of electricity. The KREIF is owned by KMG International, a subsidiary of Kazakhstan's state-owned KazMunaiGaz, and the Romanian state.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a visbreaking unit at Plock. The visbreaking unit refinery will have a capacity to produce 200,000 mt/year of diesel. Ongoing modernization of the hydrocracking and diesel hydrodesulfurization units at Plock will also increase the refinery's diesel production capacity.

PKN Orlen has bought a license and base design from US engineering company KBR for a potential bottom-of-the-barrel project. If PKN takes a final investment decision, it will construct a production complex using solvent de-asphalting and fluid catalytic cracking technologies.

Separately, PKN Orlen has signed a contract with Linde to build a new oxygen and nitrogen production unit at its Plock refinery. The unit will produce 38,500 cu m/hour of oxygen and 75,000 cu m/hour of nitrogen, supplying gas feedstock for the new Olefin III complex and other installations at Plock. The project is due to be completed by the start of 2025.

** Poland's PKN Orlen said it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil products loading terminal in Gdansk. PKN said both investments are scheduled to be commissioned by mid-2025. The hydrocracking base oils project will help the company diversify into second- and third-generation base oils.

** The expansion of Orlen Unipetrol's steam cracker at Litvinov is still ongoing, the company said Dec. 2022. The company said in October 2021 it was contracting Technip Energies to build a new steam cracker furnace to be commissioned in 2022. The construction of an 11th furnace is set to boost production capacity to 585,000 mt/year of ethylene from 545,000 mt/year. The company plans to increase total petrochemical production capacity to 1.4 million mt/year by 2030 from 900,000 mt/year.

PKN Orlen has completed the Czech Koruna 9.6 billion ($410 million) polyethylene 3 unit investment at Litvinov. The refinery's owner, Unipetrol, a 100%-owned PKN subsidiary, has taken charge of the black polyethylene unit, the second part of the investment. The first part, the natural polyethylene unit, was completed in April 2020. The polyethylene 3 unit, which can produce 270,000 mt/year of high density polyethylene, will replace production of one of the two existing production units with a capacity of 120,000 mt/year. Litvinov's polyethylene capacity will increase from 320,000 mt/year to 470,000 mt/year. PKN Orlen was launching construction of a unit at Litvinov to produce up to 26,000 mt/year of dicyclopentadiene, or DCPC, used in the automotive, construction and electronic industries. Separately, McDermott International has been awarded a contract for engineering, procurement and construction management services for an upgrade of the hydrocracker at the Litvinov refinery.

** Motor Oil Hellas has approved an investment into a new propylene splitter unit at the Corinth refinery. It will have 100,000 mt annual capacity and is expected to be completed by 2026. It will use the existing infrastructure of the FCC unit which will switch part of the gasoline production into propylene. The splitter is a "significant step" towards diversifying the refinery operations, the company said.

** Croatia's Rijeka refinery halted operations for five months between November 2022 and April 2023 while it continues with its upgrade project. During the shutdown, works will be carried out on "connecting existing units with new systems", the company said. It also clarified that "several suspensions" of operations are planned for the duration of the upgrade project, in which it is investing more than HRK4 billion ($524 million), as "the refinery cannot operate continuously while work is being carried out" on the existing and new units. The upgrade involves construction of a new residue complex, which includes a delayed coker. Works on the new residue complex started in 2020. Commissioning of the new complex is planned for 2024, the company said.

** France's Donges refinery is building a new hydrodesulfurization unit due to start up in the fourth quarter of 2023.

** OMV Petrom will build a new unit for aromatics products at its Petrobrazi refinery. The company said it will invest approximately EUR130 million ($142 million) on the new unit whose processing capacity will be around 1,500 mt/day of reformed gasoline. The existing aromatics unit, which started production in 1961, will be replaced over 2023-2025, and the new unit will be put in operation in 2026. OMV also said it has "successfully completed the transportation of four coke drums." The new drums will replace the current ones, which have been in use since 1989, and will be operational in 2023. The company is also considering other significant investments at Petrobrazi, "both in the technological efficiency of the refinery as well as in the production of second-generation biofuels," the company said.

** Repsol will build a new plant at Tarragona to produce 27,000 mt/year of cross-linkable polyethylene (XLPE) from mid-2024. It will also invest Eur18 million in an upgrade of its polyols unit, due to conclude in Q4 2023.

** Bosnia's Brod refinery has started construction of a bitumen unit. The refinery, which has been offline since 2019 for an upgrade, had been expected to restart once it was connected to a gas pipeline, allowing it to switch to gas-fired power operations. The line was connected in December 2021, but the plant remains offline. The owner has not given a reason why. A solar power facility at the plant has also been built to help power operations.

** Azerbaijan's state oil company Socar is looking to expand the capacity of its 212,000 b/d Star refinery in Turkey. Socar said it could expand Star's capacity to 13 million mt/year (261,000 b/d) by means of "flexibilities" in the refinery's design.

** PKN Orlen has signed an EPC contract with UK-based Petrofac to build a bottom-of-the-barrel unit at its Mazeikiu refinery in Lithuania. The unit is expected to be completed by the end of 2024 and will allow a rise in the production of high-margin products to 86% of the total, from 73%.

** Turkish construction group Tekfen Insaat said that together with partner HMB Hallesche Mitteldeutsche Bau it has signed an EPC contract with Turkey's main refiner Tupras to construct a new sulfur recovery unit at the Kirikkale refinery. Tupras' upgrade plans for its four refineries include new sulfur units at its three main refineries, Izmit, Izmir and Kirikkale. Tupras is also carrying out a revamp of the FCC unit at Izmit, which will include the installation of flue gas treatment and energy back recovery systems.

** Portugal's Galp will build a desulfurization unit with a processing capacity of 20,000 b/d at the Sines refinery. The project will allow the company to widen its crude slate.

** Greece's Hellenic Petroleum said in 2021 that Eur35 million had been approved for a capacity increase at the polypropylene production unit at Thessaloniki to 300,000 mt/year, with the implementation targeted within 2-1/2 years.

** Serbia's Pancevo refinery expects to complete its FCC project in 2023. The refinery also plans to build a unit to produce the octane enhancement chemical ETBE by 2024.

** Bulgaria's Burgas refinery has awarded a contract to US Lummus Technology for a 280,000 mt/year polypropylene plant. The deal includes a technology license as well as basic design engineering, training and services, and catalyst supply.

** ExxonMobil said it has "made a final investment decision to expand" the Fawley refinery in the UK to increase production of ultra low sulfur diesel by 45%, or 38,000 b/d. The more than $1 billion investment includes a hydrotreater to remove sulfur from diesel, supported by a hydrogen plant.

** Israel's Haifa District Court has rejected an appeal by Haifa municipality along with six other neighboring communities and environmental groups against the proposed expansion of the Bazan refinery

BIOFUEL, HYDROGEN UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** BP plans to invest up to Eur2 billion in a green hydrogen plant at Spanish Castellon to replace the existing fossil-based hydrogen plant, it said in February 2023. Under the project, BP said it plans a phased development of up to 2 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030. The project will also see Castellon's production of biofuels triple to 650,000 mt/year by 2030 with the green hydrogen used as a feedstock in biofuel production, specifically of SAF. The first phase of the project will see the installation of an electrolysis plant with at least 200 MW capacity operational by 2027, with production of up to 31,200 mt/year of green hydrogen. In a second phase, to be completed in 2030, the electrolysis plant would be expanded to reach a capacity of up to 2 GW. BP has created a joint venture with Iberdrola covering Spain, Portugal and the UK to produce green ammonia and methanol as well as 600,000 mt/year of hydrogen. The refinery also has a target to triple sustainable jet fuel output to 15,000 b/d as part of its overall decarbonization program.

** Finland's Neste has successfully concluded its second series of "industrial-scale processing runs with liquefied waste plastic" at the Porvoo refinery after carrying out the first processing run in 2020. The current processing uses the existing refinery equipment but ultimately Neste aims to establish large-scale capacities to process 400,000 mt/yr of liquefied waste plastic. From 2030 it wants to process more than 1 million mt/yr of waste plastic.

The aim is part of Neste's strategic study to transform Porvoo into "a renewable and circular solutions site and possibly end crude oil refining by the mid-2030s," it also said, adding that liquefied waste plastic would play an important part in replacing fossil crude oil.

The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

Neste had said it was targeting a final investment decision in late 2023 for its 'Sustainable Hydrogen and Recovery of Carbon' project at Porvoo. The project includes a 50-MW electrolyzer to produce 8,000 mt/year of renewable hydrogen, along with a carbon capture plant that will capture 300,000-400,000 mt/year of CO2 from the company's existing hydrogen production unit. Neste plans to switch around a quarter of its Porvoo hydrogen production to low-carbon sources with these developments, out of annual demand of over 100,000 mt.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Cepsa said March 8 it will build a new unit to produce second generation biofuel at the Huelva refinery with an investment of Eur1 billion ($1.1 billion). The plant will produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, creating 1,600 jobs, Cepsa said. The biofuels will be produced from organic waste, including used cooking oil and agricultural residues.

The plant will contribute to Cepsa's strategy to reach 2.5 million mt/year of biofuel production by 2030, making it a leader in the Iberian peninsula. The total will include 800,000 mt/year of SAF.

Cepsa started production of advanced 2G biofuels at the Huelva site in October, using cooking oils as feedstock, reducing emissions by 80%. It also concluded a conversion project of an idled unit in December 2022 to produce 400 mt per day of hydrotreated biodiesel, which can be eventually doubled to 800 mt/day.

The refinery is also planning to start up 400 MW of hydrogen production capacity by 2026, having signed agreements in January and February 2023 with local partners.

Cepsa has already signed an agreement with the Port of Rotterdam to create the first green hydrogen corridor between southern and northern Europe, allowing the export of green ammonia and methanol.

** Repsol CEO Josu Jon Imaz said Repsol would take a final investment decision in H2 2023 on 350 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity spread across Cartagena, Tarragona and Bilbao, all of which are entering their engineering phase.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a hydrotreated vegetable oils installation at Plock. PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery. The unit will process used rapeseed oil to produce an additive to diesel or aviation fuel. The annual production of the unit will be 300,000 mt of biodiesel or aviation biofuel. The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a bioethanol unit at the company's small Polish biofuels plant, Orlen Poludnie. PKN Orlen is also constructing a hydrogen plant at its Poludnie biorefinery in Trzebinia. Annual production will be 16 million cu m, and three-quarters of that will be used to produce glycol. The remainder will be used to produce 45 kg/h of fuel-grade hydrogen for use in transport.

** Finland's Neste said in its 2022 financial report that the new renewable products' production capacity in Rotterdam will expand renewable fuels production by 1.3 million mt/year "by the first half of 2026", bringing the total product capacity in Rotterdam to 2.7 million mt/year, with sustainable aviation fuel accounting for 1.2 million mt/year. The new production unit is set to be started up in the first half of 2026.

Separately, the expansion at the Singapore facility has "reached mechanical completion at the end of 2022 and is currently on schedule for start-up by the end of the first quarter 2023," Neste said. The expanded Singapore facility will include "optionality to produce" up to 1 million mt/year of SAF, which together with the Rotterdam project would result in a SAF production capability of 1.5 million mt/year in the beginning of 2024.

After commissioning "the next world-scale renewables refinery in Rotterdam," Neste's total SAF production capability is projected to increase to 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026.

Neste also reiterated that it had established a joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, with the joint operation "targeting to reach full Phase I capacity by the end of the first quarter of 2023."

Neste's current production capacity for renewable products is 3.3 million mt/year which is set to increase to 5.5 million mt/year by the end of 2023 due to the expansion at Singapore and the Martinez joint venture. When completed, the Rotterdam expansion project will further increase the total capacity to 6.8 million mt/year by the end of 2026, S&P Global has reported.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

In Oct. 2021, Gunvor said it had agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Phillips 66 is looking at carbon capture and storage as well as electrolytic green hydrogen production to decarbonize operations at its Humber refinery in the UK, Commercial Manager for Emerging Energy Mike Wailes said Feb. 2023. The initial focus is on post-combustion capture from the refining process, including from the crude topping unit, fluid catalytic cracker and hydro-desulfurization unit, with further more expensive options coming from refueling to use hydrogen, he said.

The refinery is part of the East Coast Cluster industrial decarbonization hub, selected for funding support under the UK government's first phase of CCS cluster sequencing.

Phillips 66 is developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to be powered by offshore wind which can be scalable to 300 MW.

The refinery is the only UK SAF producer, Wailes said.

The Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways in early 2022.

Phillips 66 has said previously its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Portugal's Galp said it expects to sanction key projects in 2023, including 270,000 mt/year production of HVO capacity for producing advanced biodiesel and SAF, with a final investment decision expected in the year. In terms of green hydrogen, it also expects to take FID on a 100 MW Sines hydrogen production plant during 2023, targeting an eventual roll out of up to 700 MW to the end of the decade. The 100-MW Sines electrolyzer project will target to replace existing conventional hydrogen production. Previously, Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub.

** Spain's Repsol is to build a new 25,000 mt/year production line for recycled polyethylene at its Puertollano site. The new line, which will produce high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) with a recycled plastic content of 10%-80%, was expected to come into operation by the end of 2024. Current capacity for the plastics production at the site is 16,000 mt/year. Puertollano is also due to start a first polyurethane foam recovery plant this year at Puertollano while it also has plans to build a new unit to produce 15,000 mt/year of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) to come online in 2024 with an investment of Eur105 million.

** Renewable hydrogen company Everfuel has signed an agreement in Jan. 2023 to supply oxygen to an undisclosed company from its HySynergy electrolyzer in Fredericia, Denmark, enabling a higher utilization of the plant. The conditional agreement will improve the overall utilization and efficiency of the second phase of the electrolyzer, providing a long-term revenue stream, Everfuel said. HySynergy 2.0 will extend the existing 20 MW electrolyzer with 300 MW of additional capacity by 2025. It will be developed with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia and will produce hydrogen to decarbonize industrial processes and transportation. The first 20-MW phase started hydrogen production in December, with first commercial deliveries due in 2023. The plant, adjacent to the Fredericia oil refinery, will supply renewable hydrogen to the facility and for local zero-emissions transport, Everfuel said. The plant will send 80% of the hydrogen produced to the refinery for use as a feedstock in the refining process. The remaining 20% will go to hydrogen mobility applications. Phase two is to be built in three 100-MW stages.

** Spain's Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for its planned 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

Other projects include a 2,100 mt/year synthetic fuel plant and supporting hydrogen infrastructure to come online from 2024.

A separate plant, costing Eur20 million is contemplated to generate gas to feed the refinery from urban waste and should be online by 2025.

** Piling work for a new biofuel plant being built by Shell at the site of Europe's biggest refinery, Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam (formerly Pernis), was due to be completed around summer 2023, with the new plant expected to start up in 2024 or 2025. Shell is building an 820,000 mt/year biofuel plant in Rotterdam to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste. The facility will not use virgin palm oil as a feedstock although it will process vegetable oils, such as rapeseed, to supplement the waste feedstocks "until even more sustainable advanced feedstocks are widely available," it said.

** Repsol along with Spanish companies Naturgy and Reganosa plan to construct a hydrogen electrolyzer at Meirama, close to the A Coruna plant, with the output used to feed the refinery. The first phase of the project will see 30 MW of installed capacity by 2025 at the site of a closed thermal power plant. A subsequent upgrade will take the project to 200 MW capacity, producing 30,000 mt of green hydrogen per year. A newly installed hydrotreatment unit at Spain's A Coruna that processes vegetable and cooking oils was expected to boost biofuel output by 5,500 mt/year in 2022, with the volume rising to 10,500 mt/year by 2024.

** Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery. The contract covers engineering, procurement and construction assistance for the conversion of Grandpuits "into a zero-crude platform oriented towards SAF," it said. Once in operation, the facility will have the capacity to produce 210,000 mt/year of SAF from sustainable feedstock such as used cooking oil and animal fat. Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in Q1 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform, starting in 2024.

Separately, Air Liquide is to invest over Eur130 million ($134 million) in a low-carbon hydrogen unit at the Grandpuits biorefinery. TotalEnergies has committed to buy the hydrogen under a long-term contract to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The new reforming unit, with capacity to produce over 20,000 mt/year of hydrogen, will partly recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, in place of the natural gas it normally uses.

TotalEnergies also said that its zero-crude project at Grandpuits "is based on the development of several future-oriented activities" which include chemical recycling of plastic waste, production of biosourced and biodegradable bioplastics, production of biofuels for the aviation sector, construction of a solar farm and electricity storage by batteries. The new units will be starting up from 2022 and are expected to be operational by 2025.

** Turkey's Tupras said it had completed basic engineering studies to produce sustainable aviation fuel at its Izmir refinery using Honeywell's UOP ecofining technology. Tupras said it plans eventually to produce 400,000 mt/year of SAF, renewable diesel and other products at Izmir.

** Croatia's INA is studying various options for its Sisak refinery, including a biorefinery, biogas plant and production of pure hydrogen.

** Italy's Eni said it was "investigating the opportunity to build a new bio-refinery at Eni's industrial site in Livorno." It will be Eni's third biorefinery in Italy after converting its Gela and Venice refineries into biofuel plants. Eni said its feasibility study involves building "three new plants for the production of hydrogenated biofuel: a biogenic feedstock pre-treatment unit, a 500,000 mt/year Ecofining plant and a plant for the production of hydrogen from methane gas." The design of the three plants will be completed by 2023 and construction by 2025. Local officials welcomed the potential conversion of the Livorno refinery into a biorefinery as it would maintain "the current workforce and the entire production chain."

** Italy's Eni has started producing SAF at its Taranto refinery in southern Italy, as part of its commitment to decarbonize all its products and processes by 2050. Eni plans to increase its bio-refining capacity to 5 million-6 million mt/year by 2050. Eni targets its SAF capacity to reach at least 500,000 mt/year by 2030. Eni said its SAF production will continue to grow with the start-up of over 10,000 mt/year of SAF from its Livorno refinery using bio-components produced in Eni's existing Gela and Venice bio-refineries. In 2024, Eni plans to launch SAF production at the Gela bio-refinery, where a project is underway for a further 150,000 mt/year of SAF production from 100% renewable raw materials by 2025.

** Italy's Eni said that it will install a 20 MW electrolyzer at its Gela biorefinery and a 10 MW electrolyzer at its Taranto refinery. The electrolyzers will be part of a project to develop green hydrogen by Enel Green Power and Eni which will receive public funding approved by the European Commission.

** Ineos has awarded a design contract for a planned 190,000 mt/year low-carbon hydrogen production plant at its Grangemouth refining and petrochemical site in Scotland to engineering company Atkins. The plant is expected to be operational by 2030.

** Essar, the owner of the UK's Stanlow refinery, said it has received a hydrogen-powered furnace, which is the first in the UK. The furnace has been commissioned by Essar Oil UK "as it transitions to run its operations on hydrogen as part of HyNet, the UK's leading decarbonization cluster," it said. The furnace, which will run on 100% hydrogen fuel from 2026, "forms a central part of Essar's strategy at Stanlow to become the UK's first low-carbon refinery." The furnace will replace three gas-fired furnaces at the plant's crude distillation unit. Essar is also developing 300,000 cu m of biofuel storage capacity at the site, allowing customers to store, blend and distribute biofuels for the road, aviation and marine sectors. It will become the UK's largest biofuels storage facility when completed.

** OMV Petrom will start producing SAF at its Petrobrazi refinery, which will become the first refinery in Romania to produce the fuel. The refinery will produce SAF by coprocessing locally produced rapeseed oil. In the future, it aims to increase the production capacities and produce sustainable fuels based on various waste feedstocks, such as used cooking oil. "Our goal is that, in 2030, to have an annual combined production of SAF and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil) of about 450 thousand tons," Radu Caprau, member of the Executive Board responsible for Refining & Marketing said.

** Repsol and partners Enerkem and Agbar have presented a project to transform 400,000 mt/year of urban waste to 220,000 mt/year methanol at Tarragona, which should start up in 2025 with an investment of Eur250 million. Spain's Tarragona has started on a series of energy transition projects, including the manufacture of biofuel for aviation and an advanced biofuels plant, which is already under construction. The refinery plans to build a 100-MW hydrogen electrolyzer by 2025.

** Hungarian oil and gas group MOL will build a 10-MW electrolyzer for renewable hydrogen production at its Danube refinery in Szazhalombatta, Hungary. The electrolyzers from US company Plug Power will produce 1,600 mt/year of green hydrogen, with operations starting in 2023.

** OMV said that together with AEG Fuels it will supply SAF from its Schwechat refinery on-demand for the "general aviation segment" to be used as an alternative to conventional jet fuel at the Vienna International Airport. SAF is produced at Schwechat by co-processing Austrian used cooking oil and is supplied via a direct pipeline connection to Vienna's international airport. OMV had also supplied the first batch of SAF to Vienna International Airport for fueling Austrian Airlines aircraft. Schwechat has received the two main components for producing SAF -- the reactor and column. From mid-2023 up to 160,000 mt of liquid biomass will be converted into SAF using an innovative co-processing method, it said. "The new reactor will process substances including vegetable oil together with other feedstocks in a procedure known as co-processing. This innovative process involves refining the biogenic feedstock via a hydrogenation process using hydrogen," OMV said. In the future, the process can be used for processing other feedstock such as used cooking oil or advanced bio-fuels. OMV plans to increase its SAF sales to more than 700,000 mt/year by 2030. Separately, OMV will build the country's largest electrolysis plant at the Schwechat refinery through a joint investment with Kommunalkredit Austria AG. The plant is expected to start in H2 2023. The 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis will produce up to 1,500 mt/year of green hydrogen.

** Germany's Bayernoil is looking at producing SAF from sewage sludge. It could convert 100,000 mt of sewage sludge into SAF annually under Project Bayosine. The processing, which involves pyrolisis, can be done in a new unit at the Vohburg site of the plant.

** Sweden's Preem aims to expand the HVO capacity at its Gothenburg plant from 320,000 cu m/year to 1.3 million cu m/year in 2026. "This is planned to take place in a completely new facility designed to produce renewable vehicle fuels and aviation fuels with great flexibility," it said. In its Lysekil plant, production of HVO from the Synsat plant "was the highest to date," the company said. Preem is rebuilding the existing Synsat plant, so it can produce renewable raw materials and replace part of the fossil production. It is expected to reach renewable production capacity of 950,000 cu m/year by 2024.

** Finland's UPM expects its Leuna biorefinery in Germany to be operational by the end of 2023 and ramp up in 2024. Construction of the facility, which will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals, started in 2020. Its total annual capacity will be 220,000 mt bio-monoethylene glycol and lignin-based renewable functional fillers. It will also produce monopropylene glycol and industrial sugars made from sustainably harvested beechwood sourced regionally in Germany.

** Greece's Motor Oil Hellas said its Corinth refinery by 2030 aims to enhance its pure hydrogen infrastructure through demonstration and scale-up of green hydrogen. In the long term, it aims to be a "large producer of clean hydrogen".

** France's TotalEnergies said it has "successfully started production" of SAF at its Gonfreville refinery in Normandy. The new site complements the biojet production capacities of the company's La Mede refinery and the Oudalle plant. All the biojet will be supplied to French airports and will be produced from waste and residue sourced from the circular economy. La Mede, in the south of France, and Oudalle, near Le Havre, began producing SAF in April 2021. La Mede stopped processing crude oil at the end of 2016 and was converted into a bio plant in 2019.

** Repsol's Cartagena has started construction of its planned second-generation biofuel plant at the nearby to the refinery Escombreras facility, which should result in the production of 250,000 mt/year of biodiesel from waste from mid-2023. The company will invest Eur200 million in the project that would output biodiesel, biojet, bionaphtha and biopropane, allowing an overall CO2 reduction of 900,000 mt/year. As part of its drive to decarbonize the refinery, Repsol also plans to build a 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer at Cartagena, with a target date of 2025.

** PKN Orlen said its subsidiary Orlen Poludnie has signed an agreement to build a "complex of units for production of II generation bioethanol" at its biofuel refinery in Jedlicze, southern Poland. The B2G complex will include a main unit for bioethanol production and will have the capacity to produce 25,000 mt/year of bioethanol from biomass. In the next stage, a biogas plant will be built. The biomass will be mainly cereals straw sourced from Polish farmers. The bioethanol complex will also include a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant, which will generate heat for bioethanol production. The Jedlicze refinery is a small former petroleum refinery, which together with the Trzebinia refinery, was incorporated into Orlen Poludnie, the company's biofuels subsidiary.

** Orsted and BP are to jointly develop a 50 MW renewable hydrogen project at BP's Lingen refinery in Germany. The project, expected to be operational in 2024, would comprise a 50 MW electrolyzer capable of generating 9,000 mt/year of hydrogen, 20% of the refinery's current fossil-based hydrogen consumption. The electrolyzer is expected to be powered by an Orsted North Sea offshore wind farm. The partners have a longer-term ambition to build more than 500 MW of renewable hydrogen capacity at Lingen, providing renewable hydrogen to meet all the refinery's hydrogen demand and provide feedstock for future synthetic fuel production.

** Italian energy company Eni and SEA, the operator of Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, have signed an agreement to supply SAF for commercial flights, as a step towards accelerating the "ecological transition" of the two airports. Eni plans to develop Eni Biojet which will be made "exclusively" from used cooking oil or animal fats and can be "used in a blend with conventional jet fuel of up to 50%," Umberto Carrara, Director of Green/Traditional Refining and Market at Eni said. The company plans to produce around 200,000 mt/year by 2024 and double the production by 2030.

** BP has partnered with Dutch green hydrogen company HyCC to develop its 250-MW H2-Fifty electrolyzer project in Rotterdam. The companies will next select a technology partner for the previously announced renewable hydrogen project and begin environmental studies, with a final investment decision expected in 2023. The project is expected to come online in 2025. The renewable hydrogen produced at the facility will replace fossil-based feedstock at BP's Rotterdam refinery and other industries in the area. The plant will be situated in the Maasvlakte area of Rotterdam.

** Russia's Lukoil said in December 2021 that it has signed memorandum of intent with Rusatom Overseas, part of the Rosatom Group, to cooperate in the production and supply of green hydrogen for the company's Petrotel refinery in Ploesti, Romania.

** Varo Energy's Cressier refinery in Switzerland will use solar panel generated electricity by 19,000 photovoltaic panels for a "significant portion" of the electricity it consumes. Varo Energy Group and Groupe E will build the "most powerful ground-mounted solar facility in Switzerland" with an installed capacity of 7.7 MW. It will be built in the industrial zone east of the refinery. At full power the park will be able to supply more than 60% of the refinery's needs.

** ExxonMobil, Macquarie's Green Investment Group, and SGN are studying the potential for a low-carbon hydrogen hub centered around ExxonMobil's Fawley refinery on the UK's south coast. Initial hydrogen production could be around 4.3 TWh/year from 2030. Hydrogen demand in the Southampton industrial cluster around the refinery could reach 37 TWh by 2050.

** Italy's Saras is working on activating a green hydrogen plant for a total of 20 MW. Saras is building the green hydrogen plant with Italian utility Enel. The hydrogen produced would be used at the Sarroch refinery. It is currently provided by the IGCC complex and two reforming units on the industrial site.

** The Refhyne II consortium, developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for Shell's Rheinland refinery in Germany at its Wesseling site, has received a Eur32.4 million grant from the EU. The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies will stop using palm oil at La Mede from 2023. The biorefinery has already significantly reduced the amount of palm oil it processes from 500,000 mt/year initially to 100,000 mt/year in 2021. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen at Gdansk. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

Austria's neutrality sometimes goes so far as to seek equality between aggressor and defender

Before February 24, 2022, Austria - a neutral country, but at the same time a member of the EU that sanctioned Russia - was quite pro-Russian. The red carpet was rolled out for Putin in Vienna, and the Austrian leadership was happy to visit Russia and sign multi-billion contracts. The Austrian media called Russia's ongoing hybrid war in eastern Ukraine a "conflict" or "crisis," with no link to Russia, or sometimes, in general, it was called a "civil war" in the Kremlin's style.

How did the situation change after February 24? How strong is Russia's influence in the country and who are the main drivers of Russian narratives? Is the federal government fighting Russian disinformation, including the one that concerns Ukraine, and how successfully? What is the perception of Russia's war against Ukraine through the prism of Austrian neutrality?

Ukrinform spoke about these and other issues with Dietmar Pichler, an Austrian disinformation expert and a co-founder of the Vienna-based Center for Digital Media Literacy (Zentrum für Digitale Medienkompetenz).

OLD RUSSIAN NARRATIVES HAVE RETURNED TO AUSTRIA SINCE LAST SUMMER, EXCEPT FOR ONE

- After February 24, 2022, the world, for the most part, was clear in defining what was happening and condemning Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, unlike the same events in 2014. What do you think was decisive in this?

- People somehow understood that the annexation of Crimea was an aggressive act against international law by the Russian Federation. However, the same cannot be said about the Russian aggression in Donbas. Despite warlords like Girkin and Borodai, soldiers "on vacation," Russian money and weapons, and several radical groups sent from Russia to Donbas, many people still misunderstood it as an "internal conflict of Ukraine." This includes several politicians who wanted to continue doing business with Russia. Russian disinformation provided the groundwork for such a wrong perception.

In comparison, it was impossible to ignore the full-scale invasion in 2022: almost nobody in the West bought the wording "special operation" by the Kremlin, and it was “officially” communicated that Russian troops are fighting on Ukrainian soil.

- Can we say that the Russian propaganda machine lost this information battle, at least in the stage before the full-scale invasion and its first stage?

- I would differentiate between the days before the full-scale invasion and the days after the invasion in 2022. Especially in Austria during the days before the invasion, we could read a lot of quite pro-Russian narratives. Instead of correctly reporting that "Russia claims to feel threatened by NATO," the media reported "Russia feels threatened by NATO." We heard that "NATO expansion was a provocation for Russia" without mentioning the security interests of, for instance, the Baltic States and Poland.

Some even made fun of the warnings of a large-scale invasion. However, after February 24th, the tune changed. For some time, solidarity with Ukraine and outrage over the Russian attack dominated the discourse, but that state did not last long. Since last summer, we have heard the same old Russian narratives, except for the claim that Russian troops are not active in Ukraine.

MANY PEOPLE ALREADY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A WAR OF DICTATORSHIP AGAINST DEMOCRACY

- How successful has Ukraine been in conveying its narratives about Russia's aggressive war against the Ukrainian people, and how do you generally assess Ukraine's strategic communications and soft power in the struggle for the perception of a warring Ukraine in the world?

- Soft power is very important in gaining support, not only from politicians but also from the general public in democratic countries. When President Zelensky decided not to leave Kyiv, asking for "weapons instead of a ride," it made a huge impact on the Western audience. People are now more familiar with where Ukraine is located, who Ukrainians are, and what is happening in Ukraine. Unfortunately, that does not include the events from 2014. Even more, supporters of Ukraine's resistance against the full-scale invasion by the Russian Federation are not very well informed about the events of 2014/2015.

The clear response by the European Union and the steady support of the United States shows that the call for help and international lobbying for support by Ukrainian officials was indeed successful. Many, but unfortunately not all people, understand that there are not "two former Soviet republics" fighting, but a dictatorship against a democracy. It may sound less relevant now, but cultural diplomacy still plays a huge role. As we see now, the biggest supporters of Ukraine are people who have traveled to the country. During Yanukovich's times, we did not see efforts of cultural diplomacy, and after that, the war in Donbas prevented tourism and overshadowed cultural initiatives. The EU candidate country status is a very important achievement of Ukrainian diplomacy and helpful in understanding the values Ukrainians are fighting for.

GROUP WITH "SOFT" RUSSIAN NARRATIVES MORE DANGEROUS THAN OPENLY PRO-RUSSIAN GROUP

- The self-sacrifice and courage with which Ukrainians are resisting the Russian invasion have caused a wave of interest in Ukraine worldwide. In your opinion, what are the main narratives about Ukraine in the West, particularly in Austria - which, among other things, were imposed by Russian propaganda - that were destroyed during this war?

Firstly, I want to highlight that Austria is one of the countries highly influenced by Russian narratives and has a history of "neutrality" that sometimes goes so far as to seek equality between aggressor and defender, which is morally more than questionable.

We have people who assess the situation as it is. Ukrainians are defending their independence, their right to exist as a free nation, and their path to choose their own destiny towards Europe against the Russian dictatorship.

Then we have people who condemn the war but continue with a list of "justifications," even if they say "nothing can justify the full-scale invasion," but this is exactly what they do. They ask for negotiations without naming what should be negotiated. I think this group, with "soft" Russian narratives, is more dangerous than the last group that is openly pro-Russian, praising the Kremlin and what contemporary Russia stands for.

I would like to add that the biggest problem with the group that asks for "immediate negotiations and stopping the fighting at all costs" is that they are not aware of the situation in the occupied territories and the war crimes happening there. Not only Russian TV propagandists, but also Kremlin officials openly communicate their ideas of cultural genocide, but these goals and activities are not well known among the Austrian public. The idea that "if the fighting stops, the suffering stops" is widespread. Some people who spread this view are possibly paid by the Kremlin, while others are just not well-informed about the actual situation in Ukraine and Russian goals there.

KREMLIN PROPAGANDA IN THE EU IS UNSUCCESSFUL, BUT PUBLIC OPINION IS DIVIDED

- At the same time, Russia is trying to undermine the unity of the West in supporting Ukraine through various influence operations and disinformation campaigns to reduce this support and weaken the sanctions regime. In your estimation, how successful have the Kremlin's actions been in the EU countries so far?

- I would say that if we take a look at the support and unity regarding Ukraine, it seems that the campaigns were not very successful, even though the scale of support could be bigger and better organized.

On the other hand, we have public opinion that is very divided, especially when it comes to "negotiations at all costs" and the delivery of weapons to Ukraine. Surveys show that in countries like Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy, there is a huge impact of Russian narratives on public opinion.

Russian disinformation was successful in convincing many people that "NATO expansion was a trigger for Russia", that "Ukraine needs to be neutral for the sake of Russia's security interests", and that "Ukraine was to blame for the events of 2014".

RUSSIAN NARRATIVES ARE SPREAD MOST BY THE FAR RIGHT AND FAR LEFT

- How vulnerable is Austria to Russia's disinformation campaigns, and what does Russia exploit most in Austrian society to spread its narratives successfully?

- Austrian society is very vulnerable to Russian disinformation campaigns because, unfortunately, we have not taken efforts to tackle that threat since 2014. We have professors who teach at our universities and give interviews to Russia Today, Sputnik, and Iranian state media, spreading Russian or even Soviet narratives for decades. Despite the clear situation, we tend to analyze things "neutrally," even if we depart from reality. Although RT and Sputnik are banned in the EU now, press releases by the Russian Federation find their way to our media, sometimes not reported in the context of the Russian disinformation machine. People are not well informed about Ukraine at all, making them even more vulnerable to Russian disinformation. In political talk shows, several guests are able to spread Russian narratives with almost no resistance. This "false balance" situation is very common and fueled by our "ideology of neutrality." Like in all countries, Russian narratives are most spread and believed by the far right and far left in terms of ideology.

The "we want peace with Russia" position is also common at people who blame sanctions for Europe's economic situation, rather than attributing it to the Russian war of aggression.

- How did the events of February 24 affect Austrian perceptions of Russia and, thus, the narratives spread by the Kremlin?

- Even though the effect was smaller than in other countries, there have been slight improvements in the discourse. More people are now critically questioning pro-Russian positions and our close economic ties with the Russian Federation. However, considering the situation in Ukraine, the developments within Russia, and the goals of the Kremlin, the change in discourse and view of Russia is still far from being based on reality.

MAIN DISTRIBUTORS OF RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA IN AUSTRIA ARE FREEDOM PARTY AND SOME POLITICIANS FROM SOCIAL DEMOCRATS

- Who are the main distributors of Russian propaganda in Austria today?

- The far-right "Freedom Party" is widely known for spreading Russian narratives, particularly after signing a contract with "United Russia" in 2016. However, some politicians from the Social Democrats and especially the Communist parties also disseminate Russian narratives on TV and social media. Speaking of social media, it is one of the main channels where not only trolls but also so-called "intellectuals" or "peace activists" spread their pro-Russian disinformation narratives. The most famous ones are frequently invited to mainstream TV to speak in political talk shows.

At the end of November 2022, I traveled to Ukraine to hold a workshop about the impact of Russian disinformation in the country, with Ukrainian journalists. The group was surprised by how strong the impact of Russian disinformation is in the German-speaking world. One woman summarized it by saying, "I cannot believe what people in Germany and Austria are believing."

- President Zelensky recently gave a speech at the Austrian parliament. What were the reactions in Austrian society?

- President Zelensky's recent video speech in the Austrian parliament created a huge stir in Austria, with some finding it controversial due to Austria's history of "neutrality" being interpreted in a political way. The pro-Russian leaning Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) protested against the speech by leaving the parliament. Outside the parliament, a rally was held against the speech by far-right, far-left, "peace activists," and conspiracy theorists.

What was particularly interesting was that over 50% of the Social Democratic MPs chose not to attend the speech, leading to a broad discussion about their relationship with Russia and the lack of solidarity towards Ukraine. As a result, five Austrian journalists contacted the speaker for information on pro-Russian narratives within the SPÖ. For the first time since the annexation of Crimea, a much-needed discourse has been initiated. Fortunately, many Social Democrats do not support the pro-Russian groups within their party, who claim to be "in favor of neutrality." In reality, these groups not only have a pro-Russian bias, but they also tend to defend or support countries like Venezuela, Cuba, China, or, in some cases, even Iran.

Austria does not have a communist party in parliament, unlike "the Left" in Germany, so such ideologies are present under the wing of the Social Democratic party for decades. Some SPÖ MPs refer to their critics as "NATO trolls," request to stop "war cruelties on both sides," and label President Zelensky's speech as "war propaganda in the parliament." They do not represent the entire party, which provides an opportunity for the Social Democrats to decide on a way of "democratic foreign policy," as one member of the party suggested.

Unfortunately, the lower ranks of the party appear even worse, particularly regarding social media, where some party members post "RT," Russian embassy content, conspiracy theories, and obscure Russian narratives. It is hoped that not only Austrian society but also the party itself will scrutinize these wings in the party and their role for the Social Democrats, who are already in crisis in Austria.

AUSTRIA'S GOVERNMENT NOT DOING ENOUGH TO COMBAT FOREIGN DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS

- How to fight against this propaganda?

- In Austria, we need a new discourse, a new style of discussion, especially after decades of praising neutrality. I am a member of a security initiative that asks for this new discourse and a new perception on how we should support our European partners and strengthen our security, especially towards Russia. We need to understand Media Literacy and Information Literacy as a matter of national security to protect our democracy. The European Union reacted already in 2014, but our national government did not understand how important this issue is becoming, especially since Russia annexed Crimea and increased activities in information warfare. Awareness for this issue is urgently needed. In the case of the Russian disinfo-campaign against Ukraine we need to educate the whole population in the big picture of what was happening and what is happening: Means from the annexation of Crimea, to the Russian aggression in Donbas, MH17, until the full-scale invasion 2022. What is also important to teach the audience about the situation in the occupied territories, the genocidal campaign by Russian propaganda and also the domestic situation in Russia, including jailing of people who are against the war.

- Does Austria have effective initiatives to increase media literacy and combat disinformation, and what role does the Austrian media play in this regard?

- Austria's efforts to establish media literacy or information literacy are superficial and not specialized in countering foreign disinformation. Moreover, the government has not made significant efforts to counter foreign disinformation campaigns by authoritarian regimes, particularly Russia. There is no task force in place, nor any information campaign to educate the population about the events in Ukraine since 2014.

While the media has started to address the issue of Russian disinformation more thoroughly, especially after the full-scale invasion in 2022, we need further efforts to show and explain the big picture of the Russian aggression against Ukraine since 2014, as significant knowledge gaps still exist.

Overall, Austria should prioritize developing more specialized approaches to counter foreign disinformation campaigns, and the government should take concrete steps to educate the public and raise awareness about these issues.

SANCTIONS AGAINST PROPAGANDISTS MAY BE PART OF THE SOLUTION

- Ukraine has vast experience in countering Russia's hybrid warfare, of which information warfare is also a part. Against this backdrop, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine launched the so-called "Information Ramstein" initiative to unite and better coordinate international efforts to counter Russian disinformation and propaganda and to support Ukrainian media. How do you feel about this initiative, and what do you see as its prospects?

- I believe that the idea of coordinating and sharing international efforts and experiences is always a good one, and we need plenty of forums to facilitate this. On one hand, we need to exchange information and provide regional experiences. On the other hand, we should not forget about reaching the general public, and not just “preaching to the converted”.

- As part of this "Information Ramstein" initiative, Ukraine proposes to its partners the idea of criminalizing articles against Russian propagandists at the international level and introducing the concept of the crime of using information weapons at the EU level. Can this work in the fight against Russian propaganda?

- We need a multilevel approach to effectively combat disinformation in the European Union. One factor can indeed be to identify propagandists and sanction them accordingly, especially when they are paid by foreign governments like Russia.

- How can EU legislation be improved to prevent disinformation campaigns in Europe?

- If individuals are paid by a foreign power to engage in propaganda here, the European Union should also have the means to respond accordingly. This also applies to the member states. However, freedom of expression is a valuable asset, which is why such measures must be carefully and cautiously considered.

UKRAINE NEEDS TO REACH PUBLIC OPINION IN BRAZIL, SOUTH AFRICA AND INDIA

- While Europeans already know who Ukrainians are and what kind of war is going on in the country, the situation in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is not the best in this regard because of the large presence of Russian media. What are your suggestions for conveying the truth about Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and countering Russian narratives in the countries of the so-called "Global South"?

- I believe that the Ukrainian government's initiative to improve and strengthen relations with African states is a positive step forward. Many countries in Africa are autocratic states, which makes Russia and China their "natural partners". This not only complicates the situation for Ukraine but also for other Western democracies. Given the Russian aggression, Ukraine could benefit from a pragmatic approach to building ties with these countries, something that the US, Germany, or the United Kingdom may find more challenging.

In my opinion, it is crucial for Ukraine to focus on countries such as Brazil, South Africa, and India. These countries are democracies, where public opinion has a significant influence on government decisions. If Ukraine can effectively communicate its message to the public in these countries, it may lead to a shift in political perspectives. This approach could also be applied to other countries in Central and South America.

Vienna, April 20 (TASR) - Europe sold its values for cheap Russian gas and oil in recent years, but democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law mustn't be sold for convenience - as Ukraine has shown Europe after it was attacked by Russia, interim Prime Minister Eduard Heger said in a lecture on Slovakia's vision for Europe at the Diplomatic Academy of Vienna on Wednesday evening.

According to Heger, the vision that European countries had in recent years has changed as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The focus has shifted from economic growth as the main objective to security.

Heger warned that in the event of a military victory in Ukraine, Russia would be Slovakia's neighbour and at the same time the security structure of Europe would fundamentally change. After the Russian invasion, NATO membership proved to be the only protection for Slovakia, the prime minister stressed, praising the Allies for sending troops and air defence systems to the country.

As for Slovakia's vision for Europe, Heger highlighted good neighbourly relations and unity in the European Union. The premier noted that the Union has already adopted ten sanction packages against Russia. In addition to sanctions, the EU is also helping Ukraine militarily and in humanitarian terms, he remarked.

Regarding EU enlargement, Heger warned that if the bloc does not have good relations with neighbouring countries, "someone else will". That is why, according to him, it is necessary to talk openly about enlargement with the Western Balkan countries. "It's not just a matter of growth and investment, it's also a matter of security," he added.

REFINERY NEWS ROUNDUP: Progress on upgrades in Europe

Companies in Europe are reporting progress on upgrades.

Spain's Repsol said it was retrofitting the hydro units at all five Spanish refineries it operates to increase its use of bio feedstock as the business was starting to give positive impetus to its refining margins.

Spanish refinery Cepsa has signed a joint venture agreement with the Spain-based subsidiary of Singapore's Apical for feedstock supply to its proposed 500,000 mt/year sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel plant at the Huelva refinery, the companies said April 14. Cepsa announced its intention to build the Eur1 billion ($1.1 billion) plant March 8, as it plans to produce 2.5 million mt/year of biofuel by 2030, including 800,000 mt/year of SAF.

The new plant will secure the majority of the feedstock supply from organic waste such as agricultural residue or used cooking oils through a global, long-term agreement with Apical, it said. The deal will enable it to address one of the key challenges in the biofuel industry -- the access to feedstock, Cepsa said. The new plant will include two pre-treatment units and the capacity for flexible production of 500,000 mt/year of SAF and renewable diesel for land, sea and air transportation. The plant is scheduled to begin operating in the first half of 2026.

Cepsa also said April 21 that it has completed a month-long maintenance at Huelva. The work entailed maintenance of units related with CO2 emissions reduction, safety systems and an increase of 2G biofuel capacity. A large part of the work took place in the hydrocracker unit to produce more biofuels from various renewable sources such as vegetable oil, it noted. The company previously carried out related conversion of its high pressure hydrotreatment unit to facilitate the processing of vegetable waste, it said.

Separately, Italy's Eni said that bio throughput in the first quarter rose 49% to 136,000 mt, while utilization was at 54%, up from 36%, as higher volumes were processed at the Gela biorefinery compared with Q1 2022 when it carried out maintenance, but were "partly offset" by lower throughput at the Venice plant.

Finnish refiner Neste reported strong refining and renewable products margins in the first quarter, noting that 2023 would be a "a year of growth" for its renewables business.

Neste said the Rotterdam expansion project was "proceeding well" and that its Singapore expansion started up production after mid-April. Its joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, started up its first phase in February.

"Together, the growth projects are targeting to increase our total nameplate capacity of renewable products to 5.5 million tons by the end of 2023," Neste said.

Renewables products' comparable sales margin was a "record high" at $945/mt, up from $783/mt as "the renewable diesel demand was robust and feedstock prices continued at a favorable level, as seen already in late 2022."

However, Neste said the sales volume for renewable diesel and SAF at 660,000 mt was lower year on year due to a fire at the Rotterdam facility in late 2022. It previously reported the fire at a processing unit at the plant in December that led to a month-long shutdown. Its renewables production facilities operated at an average 93% utilization rate in the first quarter, down from 104%.

Second-quarter volumes are expected to be 30%-50% higher than the first quarter, with the increase "subject to the ramp-up pace" of the capacity expansion in Singapore and its joint operation in Martinez.

"The second-quarter utilization rates of renewable production facilities are forecast to remain high, assuming a successful ramp-up of our new facilities both in Martinez, California and in Singapore," Neste said. It added that it has scheduled a five-week maintenance shutdown at the Singapore facility for the third quarter and a four-week maintenance shutdown at Rotterdam in the fourth quarter.

Neste reiterated that by increasing the SAF capabilities in Singapore and Rotterdam it was "targeting the optionality" to produce up to 1.5 million mt/year of SAF in 2024, which will reach 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026 when its nameplate capacity in renewable products is expected to increase to 6.8 million mt/year.

CONVENTIONAL UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** Greece's Motor Oil Hellas said in April 2023 that an investment in a new propylene splitter unit is "about to begin". The unit will have 100,000 mt annual capacity and is expected to be completed by 2026. It will use the existing infrastructure of the FCC unit which will switch part of the gasoline production into propylene.

** Croatia's Rijeka refinery completed planned activities during a shutdown and was starting up, it said in early May 2023. The refinery halted operations for five months between November 2022 and April 2023 while it continues with its upgrade project. During the shutdown, works will be carried out on "connecting existing units with new systems", the company said. It also clarified that "several suspensions" of operations are planned for the duration of the upgrade project, in which it is investing more than HRK4 billion ($524 million), as "the refinery cannot operate continuously while work is being carried out" on the existing and new units. The upgrade involves construction of a new residue complex, which includes a delayed coker. Works on the new residue complex started in 2020. Commissioning of the new complex is planned for 2024.

** UK-based Petrofac has secured a new EPC contract for the modernization and expansion of Orlen Lietuva's refinery in Lithuania, it said in April 2023.

"Petrofac's scope of work encompasses the design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of new facilities, as ORLEN Lietuva invests to expand the existing refinery complex," it said, adding that it has previously secured an EPC for the addition of a new residue hydrocracking unit at the refinery.

In October 2021, Petrofac was awarded another EPC contract to build a bottom of the barrel unit at the Mazeikiai refinery in Lithuania, due to be completed by the end of 2024. The construction started in August 2022. The new EPC includes the installation of a new amine regeneration unit and stabilization tower, interconnecting pipework and tie-ins to the existing refinery units, Petrofac said.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Slovakia's Slovnaft has awarded an engineering, procurement services and construction management (EPSCM) contract for an off-gas upgrade at its Bratislava steam cracker to McDermott. The project will upgrade the existing steam cracker unit by adding a low-pressure recovery unit, increasing ethylene production capacity utilizing the off-gas from the existing production, McDermott said in a statement. Following the expansion, the capacity of the PP3 unit will increase by 33,000 mt/year to 300,000 mt/year. Construction was expected to start in the summer of 2023 and be completed in October 2024.

** Romania's Rompetrol said the cogeneration plant at the Petromidia refinery has reached "over 80%" general progress, including "around 95% progress on the engineering side, more than 96% on the procurement side and the actual construction is approaching 72%." The Kazakh-Romanian Energy Investment Fund (KREIF) "has made considerable progress in commissioning the cogeneration plant," the company said in March 2023. The project, which started in May 2021, will ensure the refinery's energy needs "exclusively from the cogeneration plant," it said. The new facility will generate approximately 80 MW of electricity. The KREIF is owned by KMG International, a subsidiary of Kazakhstan's state-owned KazMunaiGaz, and the Romanian state.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a visbreaking unit at Plock. The visbreaking unit refinery will have a capacity to produce 200,000 mt/year of diesel. Ongoing modernization of the hydrocracking and diesel hydrodesulfurization units at Plock will also increase the refinery's diesel production capacity.

PKN Orlen has bought a license and base design from US engineering company KBR for a potential bottom-of-the-barrel project. If PKN takes a final investment decision, it will construct a production complex using solvent de-asphalting and fluid catalytic cracking technologies.

Separately, PKN Orlen has signed a contract with Linde to build a new oxygen and nitrogen production unit at its Plock refinery. The unit will produce 38,500 cu m/hour of oxygen and 75,000 cu m/hour of nitrogen, supplying gas feedstock for the new Olefin III complex and other installations at Plock. The project is due to be completed by the start of 2025.

** Poland's PKN Orlen said it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil products loading terminal in Gdansk. PKN said both investments are scheduled to be commissioned by mid-2025. The hydrocracking base oils project will help the company diversify into second- and third-generation base oils.

** The expansion of Orlen Unipetrol's steam cracker at Litvinov is still ongoing, the company said Dec. 2022. The company said in October 2021 it was contracting Technip Energies to build a new steam cracker furnace to be commissioned in 2022. The construction of an 11th furnace is set to boost production capacity to 585,000 mt/year of ethylene from 545,000 mt/year. The company plans to increase total petrochemical production capacity to 1.4 million mt/year by 2030 from 900,000 mt/year.

PKN Orlen has completed the Czech Koruna 9.6 billion ($410 million) polyethylene 3 unit investment at Litvinov. The refinery's owner, Unipetrol, a 100%-owned PKN subsidiary, has taken charge of the black polyethylene unit, the second part of the investment. The first part, the natural polyethylene unit, was completed in April 2020. The polyethylene 3 unit, which can produce 270,000 mt/year of high density polyethylene, will replace production of one of the two existing production units with a capacity of 120,000 mt/year. Litvinov's polyethylene capacity will increase from 320,000 mt/year to 470,000 mt/year. PKN Orlen was launching construction of a unit at Litvinov to produce up to 26,000 mt/year of dicyclopentadiene, or DCPC, used in the automotive, construction and electronic industries.

BIOFUEL, HYDROGEN UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** Repsol said it was retrofitting the hydro units in all five Spanish refineries it operates to increase its use of bio feedstock as the business was starting to give positive impetus to its refining margins. Mild hydrocracker units at A Coruna, Bilbao and Puertollano as well as hydrocrackers at Cartagena and Tarragona will all be modified with no real capex impact, CEO Josu Jon Imaz said.

Separately, Repsol would take a final investment decision in H2 2023 on 350 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity spread across Cartagena, Tarragona and Bilbao, all of which are entering their engineering phase.

** The European Commission has approved a Eur158 million Polish green hydrogen support package for Poland's Gdansk refinery under state aid rules, it said in April 2023. PKN Orlen via its LOTOS Green H2 subsidiary plans a 100 MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen used in refinery processes as well as a 50 MW solar power plant and 20 MWh battery storage, it said. The electrolyzer is expected to start operating in 2027 and gradually increase production to 13,600 mt/year.

** Finnish refiner Neste said it has decided to "proceed to the basic engineering phase" of a 120 MW electrolyzer project at its Porvoo refinery aimed to produce green hydrogen. If an investment decision is made in 2024, production could start in 2026.

The green hydrogen would be used primarily in Porvoo to replace hydrogen produced from fossil fuel and will support the company's goal "to transform the Porvoo refinery to the most sustainable refinery in Europe by 2030," it said.

Finland's Neste has successfully concluded its second series of "industrial-scale processing runs with liquefied waste plastic" at the Porvoo refinery after carrying out the first processing run in 2020. The current processing uses the existing refinery equipment but ultimately Neste aims to establish large-scale capacities to process 400,000 mt/yr of liquefied waste plastic. From 2030 it wants to process more than 1 million mt/yr of waste plastic.

The aim is part of Neste's strategic study to transform Porvoo into "a renewable and circular solutions site and possibly end crude oil refining by the mid-2030s," it also said.

The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

** Finland's Neste said in its Q1 2023 financial report that the Rotterdam expansion project is "proceeding well" and that its Singapore expansion started up production after mid-April. Its joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, started up its first phase in February. "Together, the growth projects are targeting to increase our total nameplate capacity of renewable products to 5.5 million tons by the end of 2023," Neste said. Neste reiterated that by increasing the SAF capabilities in Singapore and Rotterdam it is "targeting the optionality" to produce up to 1.5 million mt/year of SAF in 2024, which will reach 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026 when its nameplate capacity in renewable products is expected to increase to 6.8 million mt/year.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** BP plans to invest up to Eur2 billion in a green hydrogen plant at Spanish Castellon to replace the existing fossil-based hydrogen plant, it said in February 2023. Under the project, BP said it plans a phased development of up to 2 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030. The project will also see Castellon's production of biofuels triple to 650,000 mt/year by 2030 with the green hydrogen used as a feedstock in biofuel production, specifically of SAF. The first phase of the project will see the installation of an electrolysis plant with at least 200 MW capacity operational by 2027, with production of up to 31,200 mt/year of green hydrogen. In a second phase, to be completed in 2030, the electrolysis plant would be expanded to reach a capacity of up to 2 GW. BP has created a joint venture with Iberdrola covering Spain, Portugal and the UK to produce green ammonia and methanol as well as 600,000 mt/year of hydrogen. The refinery also has a target to triple sustainable jet fuel output to 15,000 b/d as part of its overall decarbonization program.

** Cepsa said March 8 it will build a new unit to produce second generation biofuel at the Huelva refinery with an investment of Eur1 billion ($1.1 billion). The plant will produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, creating 1,600 jobs, Cepsa said. The biofuels will be produced from organic waste, including used cooking oil and agricultural residues.

The plant will contribute to Cepsa's strategy to reach 2.5 million mt/year of biofuel production by 2030, making it a leader in the Iberian peninsula. The total will include 800,000 mt/year of SAF.

The refinery is also planning to start up 400 MW of hydrogen production capacity by 2026, having signed agreements in January and February 2023 with local partners.

Cepsa has already signed an agreement with the Port of Rotterdam to create the first green hydrogen corridor between southern and northern Europe, allowing the export of green ammonia and methanol.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a hydrotreated vegetable oils installation at Plock. PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery. The unit will process used rapeseed oil to produce an additive to diesel or aviation fuel. The annual production of the unit will be 300,000 mt of biodiesel or aviation biofuel. The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a bioethanol unit at the company's small Polish biofuels plant, Orlen Poludnie. PKN Orlen is also constructing a hydrogen plant at its Poludnie biorefinery in Trzebinia. Annual production will be 16 million cu m, and three-quarters of that will be used to produce glycol. The remainder will be used to produce 45 kg/h of fuel-grade hydrogen for use in transport.

** PKN Orlen said its subsidiary Orlen Poludnie has signed an agreement to build a "complex of units for production of II generation bioethanol" at its biofuel refinery in Jedlicze, southern Poland. The B2G complex will include a main unit for bioethanol production and will have the capacity to produce 25,000 mt/year of bioethanol from biomass. In the next stage, a biogas plant will be built. The biomass will be mainly cereals straw sourced from Polish farmers. The bioethanol complex will also include a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant, which will generate heat for bioethanol production. The Jedlicze refinery is a small former petroleum refinery, which together with the Trzebinia refinery, was incorporated into Orlen Poludnie, the company's biofuels subsidiary.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

In Oct. 2021, Gunvor said it had agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Phillips 66 is looking at carbon capture and storage as well as electrolytic green hydrogen production to decarbonize operations at its Humber refinery in the UK, Commercial Manager for Emerging Energy Mike Wailes said Feb. 2023. The initial focus is on post-combustion capture from the refining process, including from the crude topping unit, fluid catalytic cracker and hydro-desulfurization unit, with further more expensive options coming from refueling to use hydrogen, he said.

The refinery is part of the East Coast Cluster industrial decarbonization hub, selected for funding support under the UK government's first phase of CCS cluster sequencing.

Phillips 66 is developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to be powered by offshore wind which can be scalable to 300 MW.

The refinery is the only UK SAF producer, Wailes said.

The Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways in early 2022.

Phillips 66 has said previously its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Portugal's Galp said it expects to sanction key projects in 2023, including 270,000 mt/year production of HVO capacity for producing advanced biodiesel and SAF, with a final investment decision expected in the year. In terms of green hydrogen, it also expects to take FID on a 100 MW Sines hydrogen production plant during 2023, targeting an eventual roll out of up to 700 MW to the end of the decade. The 100-MW Sines electrolyzer project will target to replace existing conventional hydrogen production. Previously, Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub.

** Spain's Repsol is to build a new 25,000 mt/year production line for recycled polyethylene at its Puertollano site. The new line, which will produce high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) with a recycled plastic content of 10%-80%, was expected to come into operation by the end of 2024. Current capacity for the plastics production at the site is 16,000 mt/year. Puertollano is also due to start a first polyurethane foam recovery plant this year at Puertollano while it also has plans to build a new unit to produce 15,000 mt/year of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) to come online in 2024 with an investment of Eur105 million.

** Renewable hydrogen company Everfuel has signed an agreement in Jan. 2023 to supply oxygen to an undisclosed company from its HySynergy electrolyzer in Fredericia, Denmark, enabling a higher utilization of the plant. The conditional agreement will improve the overall utilization and efficiency of the second phase of the electrolyzer, providing a long-term revenue stream, Everfuel said. HySynergy 2.0 will extend the existing 20 MW electrolyzer with 300 MW of additional capacity by 2025. It will be developed with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia and will produce hydrogen to decarbonize industrial processes and transportation. The first 20-MW phase started hydrogen production in December, with first commercial deliveries due in 2023. The plant, adjacent to the Fredericia oil refinery, will supply renewable hydrogen to the facility and for local zero-emissions transport, Everfuel said. The plant will send 80% of the hydrogen produced to the refinery for use as a feedstock in the refining process. The remaining 20% will go to hydrogen mobility applications. Phase two is to be built in three 100-MW stages.

** Spain's Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for its planned 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

Other projects include a 2,100 mt/year synthetic fuel plant and supporting hydrogen infrastructure to come online from 2024.

A separate plant, costing Eur20 million is contemplated to generate gas to feed the refinery from urban waste and should be online by 2025.

** Piling work for a new biofuel plant being built by Shell at the site of Europe's biggest refinery, Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam (formerly Pernis), was due to be completed around summer 2023, with the new plant expected to start up in 2024 or 2025. Shell is building an 820,000 mt/year biofuel plant in Rotterdam to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste. The facility will not use virgin palm oil as a feedstock although it will process vegetable oils, such as rapeseed, to supplement the waste feedstocks "until even more sustainable advanced feedstocks are widely available," it said.

** Repsol along with Spanish companies Naturgy and Reganosa plan to construct a hydrogen electrolyzer at Meirama, close to the A Coruna plant, with the output used to feed the refinery. The first phase of the project will see 30 MW of installed capacity by 2025 at the site of a closed thermal power plant. A subsequent upgrade will take the project to 200 MW capacity, producing 30,000 mt of green hydrogen per year. A newly installed hydrotreatment unit at Spain's A Coruna that processes vegetable and cooking oils was expected to boost biofuel output by 5,500 mt/year in 2022, with the volume rising to 10,500 mt/year by 2024.

** Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery.

It will be built in the industrial zone east of the refinery. At full power the park will be able to supply more than 60% of the refinery's needs.

** ExxonMobil, Macquarie's Green Investment Group, and SGN are studying the potential for a low-carbon hydrogen hub centered around ExxonMobil's Fawley refinery on the UK's south coast. Initial hydrogen production could be around 4.3 TWh/year from 2030. Hydrogen demand in the Southampton industrial cluster around the refinery could reach 37 TWh by 2050.

** Italy's Saras is working on activating a green hydrogen plant for a total of 20 MW. Saras is building the green hydrogen plant with Italian utility Enel. The hydrogen produced would be used at the Sarroch refinery. It is currently provided by the IGCC complex and two reforming units on the industrial site.

** The Refhyne II consortium, developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for Shell's Rheinland refinery in Germany at its Wesseling site, has received a Eur32.4 million grant from the EU. The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies will stop using palm oil at La Mede from 2023. The biorefinery has already significantly reduced the amount of palm oil it processes from 500,000 mt/year initially to 100,000 mt/year in 2021. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen at Gdansk. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

LAUNCHES

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Turkey's Ersan Petrol is still hopeful of its plans for a 1.4 million mt/year refinery at Kahramanmaras in southeast Turkey will be able to go ahead despite repeated delays and a difficult investment climate. Project coordinator Cenk Pala said Ersan was in talks with prospective partners and sources of finance for the project and hopes to start work on the FEED study this year. The refinery is planned for a 300,000 sq m site in Kahramanmaras which holds a defunct mini refinery that will be dismantled. A pre-feasibility study by Axens has defined the configuration and capacity of the plant which will produce mainly Euro 5 diesel, Euro 5 gasoline, jet and bitumen.

** A new greenfield Porto Romano refinery in Albania will be predominantly oriented to export markets but will also be able to cover Albania's domestic demand, Helmut Mayrhofer, consultant at Larkalis said. Austria-based consultancy Larkalis is leading an international consortium working on the project which will involve building the refinery in the port town of Durres. The refinery has a two-year construction authorization and could be commissioned by end-2025, depending on international developments.

** Azeri state oil company Socar is considering developing a second refinery in Turkey, in addition to its existing 214,000 b/d Star refinery at Aliaga on Turkey's central Aegean coast.

Schrödinger’s bank . How Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank is (not) leaving Russia after a year of war

After a year of war in Ukraine, Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) AG has announced its gradual withdrawal from Russia. The news came in late March at a shareholders’ meeting where Raiffeisen CEO Johann Strobl announced[https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/raiffeisen-pursue-possible-sale-or-spin-off-russia-business-2023-03-30/] that the company was considering either selling its subsidiary bank in Russia or withdrawing this asset from the group. Experts describe Raiffeisen’s departure as a disaster that would bring the country closer to de facto disconnection from SWIFT and seriously complicate Russian business deals with its remaining foreign partners.

Raiffeisen has faced a dilemma in recent months. On the one hand, it has been under increasing pressure from international players — above all the European Central Bank and the US Treasury — and on the other hand, it is being held back by record profits in Russia and unfavourable exit conditions. Given this situation, the sensational announcement may not be as straightforward as it seems: while demonstrating its determination to leave, Raiffeisen may actually try to delay the process for as long as possible, taking the wait-and-see approach.

Novaya Gazeta Europe correspondent Darya Kozlova has outlined different scenarios for the future of Raiffeisen in Russia, showing how Russian regulators have managed to lock the bank in a gilded cage.

Illustration: Alisa Krasnikova.[https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/177e2c4f809a4ae7ab9322dcb496f8cf.jpeg]

In mid-April, a construction crane removed[https://t.me/rtvimain/72219] the huge Raiffeisen Bank sign from a building in central Moscow. This came two weeks after it finally became clear that RBI had decided to leave Russia. The process of leaving the Russian market may take up to seven months. The bank has pledged to start reducing its business activity in Russia.

After the announcement, the bank’s subsidiary decided[https://t.me/rtvimain/72219] that it was now pointless to maintain brand recognition and did not extend contracts for rooftop ads.

The first step towards closing the business was the restriction of SWIFT-transfers in dollars for a large portion of the bank’s clients and raising the minimum sum for dollar and euro transfers — first to 10,000[https://www.raiffeisen.ru/about/press/news/201876/] and then to 20,000[https://www.raiffeisen.ru/about/press/news/201882/] (the restrictions on other currencies remained the same)

According[https://www.ft.com/content/1cea1f08-83ac-4471-9fa4-1cdfcc86fcb0] to the Financial Times, Raiffeisen Bank now accounts for 40-50% of all payments between Russia and the rest of the world. Their SWIFT transfers usually take days and sometimes only a few hours, making Raiffeisen one of the easiest and most accessible tools to get money out of Russia.

Andrey Barkhota, a financial market expert, believes the restrictions on currency transfers are a signal to international regulators that the bank is serious about its decision. It can be interpreted as a willingness to comply with the sanctions — in order to do so the bank is even refusing to provide services that it has effectively monopolised.

But one should not expect the bank to leave Russia in the near future. According to Barkhota, it is likely that Raiffeisen will delay „

the process as long as possible. This is motivated both by the restrictions of Russian regulators, who have effectively taken foreign companies hostage, and by the profits the bank makes in Russia.

In 2022, its operation in the Russian market brought[https://www.ft.com/content/1cea1f08-83ac-4471-9fa4-1cdfcc86fcb0] the company a record €2.2 billion — more than 60% of its total profits. How much the restrictions will cut into the bank’s revenues is not clear: the new conditions still allow large transfers from individuals and legal entities — importers who need cross-border transfers and who would suffer[https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5839439] from the bank’s withdrawal.

Both the SWIFT restrictions and the dismantling of rooftop signs are demonstrative actions meant to assure Western countries of the bank’s impending withdrawal from Russia. Monopolists do not need advertisements.

The end of stability 

The history of Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank — one of the largest banks in Central and Eastern Europe — dates back to the late 19th century. The bank entered the Russian market in 1996 under the name Raiffeisenbank Austria.

By 2007, Raiffeisen was Russia’s largest bank with foreign capital, boasting[https://www.raiffeisen.ru/about/press/releases/2002/] more than 1.3 million clients.

Herbert Stepic. Photo: REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader.[https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/7411a8900e5544b781a28194eb7f3a82.jpeg]

Business was going very well. In an interview[https://www.banki.ru/news/interview/?id=4589631utm_source=google.comutm_medium=organicutm_campaign=google.comutm_referrer=google.com] with Vedomosti in February 2013, the former head of the bank, Herbert Stepic, could not name any downside to operating in Russia. Although he said that the government needed to fix the legal system to ensure economic development, he saw good future opportunities in Russia. „

“The most important prerequisite for the country’s economic growth is stability. You see, countries that have instability don’t get direct investments, because nobody invests in an insecure market.

Stability has emerged under Putin’s rule (and I know it wasn’t there before). This means that Russian and international companies can work — and have been working for years, I would say quite safely — in a stable environment,” Stepic said at the time.

By 2022, Raiffeisen’s subsidiary had 90 branches across Russia and a client base of more than 4 million. Raiffeisen was the tenth[http://www.finmarket.ru/database/rankings/] largest bank in terms of assets.

However, with the outbreak of full-scale war in Ukraine, the stability of the Russian market ended.

A trap for foreigners

When foreign companies started their mass exodus from Russia in the first weeks of the war, Raiffeisen Bank decided to continue operations and agreed to the restrictions imposed by the Russian Central Bank.

According to Forbes, bank executives told[https://www.forbes.ru/finansy/486203-bankovskij-pat-pocemu-rajffajzenbanku-slozno-ujti-iz-rossii] investors in early March that they had no intention of leaving the market and that the Russian subsidiary could still make a profit under such conditions.

There were indeed profits even during the first weeks of panic after 24 February. Although the number of the bank’s clients in Russia dropped[https://www.rbinternational.com/en/investors/presentations-webcasts/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/contentcontainer/contentbox/downloadlist_copy_co.download.html/0/May%2525202022.pdf] by 600,000 (14.7%) in the first quarter of 2022 and was even lower than in early 2021, the net profit remained at a level comparable to the same period of the previous year: €96 mln in the first three months.

Johann Strobl. Photo: Raiffeisen Bank .[https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/6f9e4e86704c4de9b35197d2647c19f2.jpeg]

Raiffeisen announced[https://www.rbinternational.com/en/investors/news/ir-releases/2022-03-17_RU_UA_strategic_options.html] in mid-March 2022 that it was considering a “carefully planned exit” from Russia. Raiffeisen CEO Johann Strobl then revealed that the group had received “non-binding offers” to buy the subsidiary.

But the group did not take active steps to leave Russia (at least publicly) even when other foreign players began doing so in various ways.

Raiffeisen Bank continued to operate in Russia during all this time and made record profits. RBI’s profits[https://www.ft.com/content/1cea1f08-83ac-4471-9fa4-1cdfcc86fcb0] in 2022 were two and a half times what they were in 2021 (€1.4 billion). Most of these profits came from Russia. The success was largely due to sanctions that unplugged many Russian banks from SWIFT.

For the most part, the organisation has been unable to withdraw profits from the Russian market: last year, Russia introduced regulations allowing residents from “unfriendly” countries to receive dividends only into bank accounts from which funds cannot be transferred abroad. In December, the law was relaxed[https://www.rbc.ru/economics/23/12/2022/63a414da9a79475b91011b6a?from=newsfeed] somewhat, allowing to withdraw up to half of one’s income from Russia, but only for companies that intend to continue operating in Russia.

Raiffeisen also had big losses: the reputational cost of continuing to operate in Russia had caused the company’s shares to plummet[https://www.ft.com/content/1cea1f08-83ac-4471-9fa4-1cdfcc86fcb0] by more than 40 percent since the war began.

Russian regulators also gradually reduced the freedom for foreign firms to withdraw from the market.

In August 2022, Vladimir Putin signed[http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/Document/View/0001202208050002] a decree prohibiting the sale of certain financial institutions (including the subsidiaries of foreign banks) until the end of the year without special presidential approval. Later, the document was extended[https://tass.ru/ekonomika/16508873] till the end of 2023.

According to Russian Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev, this decision was a reaction[https://www.rbc.ru/finances/08/09/2022/6318b5e79a794747167dd6a4] to the Western ban on Russian banks operating abroad. Subsidiaries of banks VTB and Otkritie, for example, had their European assets blocked[https://www.rbc.ru/politics/08/04/2022/625085139a7947671566725f].

Barkhota believes that Russia’s retaliatory measure against non-residents could force Western countries to start a dialogue on exchanging the assets of Russian banks stuck in Europe for the assets of foreign banks in Russia.

In effect, Russia has taken foreign subsidiaries hostage for the purpose of the exchange. Raiffeisen was one of those banks trapped this way.

Between a rock and a hard place

“A bank is not a sausage stand that you can close in a week”, Strobl told[https://www.ft.com/content/1cea1f08-83ac-4471-9fa4-1cdfcc86fcb0] an FT reporter last March in reference to Raiffeisen’s fate in Russia.

Economist Oleg Vyugin believes that the Raiffeisen had initially planned to wait out the war crisis: “Apparently, they hoped that business as usual would continue and the situation would resolve itself.”

Ivan Fedyakov, founder and head of the INFOLine analytical agency, explains that the fact that Raiffeisen was not under sanctions made it an important thread of connections, including financial ones, which allowed European countries to interact with foreign companies in Russia and help them leave. But, as Fedyakov points out, the banking group has spent too much time in Russia. The profits that it made off the state of affairs have irked many across the globe.

Back in Austria, Raiffeisen has been under no pressure since the war began. In an interview[https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000144186220/aussenminister-schallenberg-zu-rbi-in-russland-ein-exempel-zu-statuieren] with Der Standard in March, Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said that the bank had the right to choose its own strategy for operating in Russia and approved of the organisation’s wait-and-see tactics.

Schallenberg also pointed out that, according to the Swiss IMD and the University of St Gallen, less than 9% of foreign companies, including banks, have left[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4322502] Russia. For example, Hungary’s OTP Bank and Italy’s UniCredit continue to operate, although they too are considering[https://journal.tinkoff.ru/news/review-banks-2023/] an exit.

Nor has there been pressure from other politicians: according[https://www.ft.com/content/1cea1f08-83ac-4471-9fa4-1cdfcc86fcb0] to FT, many Austrian ministers and MPs are closely linked to Raiffeisen, which is the “home bank” for the ruling centre-right Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP).

Globally, however, the reaction to Raiffeisen’s continued operations in Russia has been somewhat different. In February 2023, Ukraine introduced sanctions against the bank’s top management. In addition, Reuters reported, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury launched an investigation[https://www.reuters.com/business/us-sanctions-authority-asks-raiffeisen-about-business-related-russia-2023-02-17/] in connection with the bank’s Russian business. OFAC asked the bank for details of its operations in Russia, the partially occupied Donbas, Ukraine, and Syria, including transaction details of certain clients. At the end of March, Reuters also reported[https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/ecb-pressures-austrias-raiffeisen-bank-quit-russia-sources-2023-03-23/] that the European Central Bank had demanded that Raiffeisen leave the Russian market or at least provide an exit plan.

Political scientist and European politics expert Tatiana Romanova[http://sir.spbu.ru/profs/?id=172] points out that the international outcry was due not so much to the bank securing transactions from Russia but rather to its providing[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/loans-russian-soldiers-fuel-calls-european-banks-quit-2023-02-13/] payment holidays for mobilised Russians. „

Like all banks in Russia, Raiffeisen’s subsidiary had to offer this service, which to the rest of the world means indirect support for the war in Ukraine.

Attitudes towards Raiffeisen could also potentially be influenced by the political situation around Austria itself. For the Kremlin, it is still a non-NATO country. Furthermore, Austria’s policy towards Russia has traditionally been seen as pragmatic. The Austrian parliament includes the right-populist Freedom Party (FPÖ), a pro-Kremlin[https://www.dw.com/ru/%2525D0%2525B4%2525D1%252580%2525D1%252583%2525D0%2525B7%2525D1%25258C%2525D1%25258F-%2525D0%2525BF%2525D1%252583%2525D1%252582%2525D0%2525B8%2525D0%2525BD%2525D0%2525B0-%2525D0%2525B2-%2525D0%2525B0%2525D0%2525B2%2525D1%252581%2525D1%252582%2525D1%252580%2525D0%2525B8%2525D0%2525B8-%2525D0%2525BF%2525D1%252580%2525D0%2525B0%2525D0%2525B2%2525D1%25258B%2525D0%2525B5-%2525D0%2525BF%2525D0%2525BE%2525D0%2525BF%2525D1%252583%2525D0%2525BB%2525D0%2525B8%2525D1%252581%2525D1%252582%2525D1%25258B-%2525D0%2525B2-%2525D1%252588%2525D0%2525B0%2525D0%2525B3%2525D0%2525B5-%2525D0%2525BE%2525D1%252582-%2525D0%2525B2%2525D0%2525BB%2525D0%2525B0%2525D1%252581%2525D1%252582%2525D0%2525B8/a-40938855] EU party that even had a cooperation agreement with the ruling United Russia party from 2016 to 2021. FPÖ now takes a neutral stance on the war in Ukraine, but that still plays[https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2023/02/27/putins-sidekicks-en] into Putin’s hands: in the European Parliament, for instance, FPÖ delegates very rarely oppose anti-Russian resolutions, in many cases abstaining from voting. And in an Austrian parliamentary session this March, members of the FPÖ left the room[https://strana.today/news/429801-deputaty-avstrijskoj-partii-svobody-pokinuli-parlament-vo-vremja-obrashchenija-zelenskoho.html] during an address by Volodymyr Zelensky.

Though the FPÖ is now in opposition in Austria, the Kremlin can still see the ruling centre-right ÖVP as a force to be negotiated with. Austria, like Switzerland, has a policy of neutrality[https://www.svoboda.org/a/chutj-luchshe-chem-orban-avstriya-ne-speshit-podderzhivatj-ukrainu/32227264.html] — this is why Vienna has not been directly involved in providing military and technical assistance to Kyiv since the war began. Moreover, last spring Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer met[https://www.svoboda.org/a/kantsler-avstrii-putin-nastroen-na-to-chtoby-reshitj-vopros-donbassa/31798429.html] with Vladimir Putin in the suburbs of Moscow. Nehammer said the visit was not at all a friendly one, but nonetheless he became the first European leader to visit Russia after 24 February 2022.

The pressure of foreign regulators could actually force Raiffeisen to look for ways to exit Russia, notes Valeriy Zinchenko, senior partner of the PenPaper law firm. According to him, the possible amount of sanction-related difficulties, including fines, may exceed the potential profits of the group’s Russian branch.

In theory, if Raiffeisen continues to operate in Russia, the consequences for the bank could be grave — it might even lose its licence, political analyst Romanova notes. She recalls the case of France’s BNP Paribas, which in 2014 was fined[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-30/bnp-paribas-charged-in-sanctions-violation-probe-in-new-york?leadSource=uverify%252520wall] $8.9 bn for violating US sanctions against Cuba, Iran and Sudan. However, both she and other experts interviewed by Novaya-Europe doubt that there will be actual sanctions in the case of Raiffeisen Bank.

As Barkhota notes, the main argument in favour of RBI leaving Russia is the possible pressure on Raiffeisen’s branches in Central and Eastern Europe if the bank continues to operate as it is now. The bank would risk client outflow, reduced profits, and transaction restrictions.

Novaya-Europe sent a request to Raiffeisen Bank asking how the decision to leave the Russian market was made and what it cost. The bank refused to divulge this information.

Ways out 

Experts single out four scenarios of how things might develop for Raiffeisen in Russia:

The RBI will postpone its market exit for as long as possible and continue to operate; The RBI will sell its business in Russia; Russian assets will be withdrawn from the RBI; The bank will gradually reduce the number of services it provides in Russia, but its structure will remain as is.

Barkhota, who finds the first scenario the most plausible, notes that from a business point of view, it is not at all profitable for Raiffeisen’s shareholders to leave Russia because to them the Russian market is a “goose that lays golden eggs”.

Because Raiffeisen Bank has pretty much monopolised SWIFT transactions in Russia, Barkhota explains, it would have to sacrifice half of its profits if it leaves. The most pragmatic option, in his opinion, would be simply to endlessly update the plans for winding down operations until the crisis is finally over.

If the bank decides to sell its Russian assets, a domestic player is likely to be a buyer. Valery Zinchenko of PenPaper believes that, given the current legislation, it is the only option that could win the approval of the Russian leadership. In the case of Raiffeisen, one should expect both a full sale of assets to a major player (most likely, one of the big state banks), and an exchange of assets.

According to sources of Frank Media, in September of last year, RBI held negotiations with Russia’s VTB bank leadership on exchanging the assets of its subsidiary (VTB Bank Europe) for the Russian assets of Raiffeisen. However, it seems that the deal fell through. In March, Der Standard wrote that RBI might exchange its assets for those of Sberbank’s European subsidiary. Sberbank CEO Herman Gref later denied that such negotiations were taking place.

According to Barkhota, the main downside to exchanging assets is the inability to objectively evaluate the value of RBI assets in Russia and of a Russian bank abroad so that the deal would satisfy both parties.

There are several obstacles to the sale of assets, as well. Firstly, selling a bank means negotiating a special exception with the Russian authorities. 2,000 companies are currently on the waiting list for such permission from the Foreign Investment Commission of the Russian Ministry of Finance. The commission meets three times a month and considers no more than seven applications per meeting. At this rate, leaving the Russian market could take years on end.

Secondly, the sale will likely occur at a very large discount. Oleg Itskhoki, economics professor at UCLA, says that from the perspective of Raiffeisen’s shareholders the most important goal is to avoid selling the company “for one ruble”. The situation is exacerbated by Russian regulations. Foreign companies can now only exit a Russian business if at least 10% of the transaction, which must be conducted with a discount of 50% or more off the asset’s market worth, is paid into the Russian budget.

“Several largest financial organisations in Russia have enough money [to purchase Raiffeisen Bank],” Barkhota points out. “But there’s a catch: it is forbidden to sell assets to companies under sanctions. How do they get their money then?”

Barkhota finds it extremely unlikely that Russian assets will be withdrawn from the RBI. This scenario is similar to the deal that Alfa Bank’s founding fathers, Mikhail Fridman and Pyotr Aven, are trying to pull off. On paper, they want to sell[https://www.interfax.ru/business/890458] the bank to a business partner, Alfa co-founder Andrei Kosogov. Being an invested party, he is likely to act not as a shareholder but as a depositary who is only holding them until they can be sold profitably. Barkhota believes that while it is possible for the management of Raiffeisen’s Russian branch to act as such a depository while the bank is run remotely, this plan is too complicated to implement.

Oleg Vyugin suggests another scenario, which would circumvent all restrictions — very slowly winding up business in Russia. First, the bank stops granting loans, then it starts closing accounts — first to legal entities, then to individuals. „

“This is the path that Citigroup has been following for over a year now. In my view, it’s the most realistic option, because in other cases the risks are too high.

If you hand over the bank to its management, it will immediately fall under sanctions. The same will happen if a Russian oligarch buys the bank. And Raiffeisenbank will immediately become uninteresting [to clients] if it is under sanctions”, Vyugin notes.

Novaya-Europe sent an inquiry to Raiffeisen Bank to find out, among other things, which exit scenario the company is primarily considering. The bank declined to comment. A Raiffeisen International spokesman reiterated what the bank had already said in a statement [https://www.rbinternational.com/en/media/Press_Releases_2023/update-on-rbi-s-business-activity-in-russia.html]in late March.

Heading towards isolation 

Ivan Fedyakov describes the departure of Raiffeisen Bank and the closure of its correspondent accounts as a disaster: it is, in a sense, as close as possible to cutting Russia off from SWIFT. The fewer banks there are that can carry out cross-border transfers, the closer Russian citizens and businesses are to financial isolation.

As Oleg Vyugin explains, Raiffeisen remains one of the few banks in Russia that legal entities can use for cross-border transfers. Other major banks that have access to SWIFT include Gazprombank. The EU and the US have not imposed their toughest sanctions against it because Gazprombank services gas settlements, and these sanctions would effectively isolate it from the dollar and euro systems.

Similarly, international transfers were until recently available at Rosselkhozbank (RSHB) due to its servicing of the Ukrainian grain deal, even though it has been disconnected from SWIFT.

Raiffeisen’s market exit will make a big difference to firms that import goods into Russia: some are already preparing to change their patterns of procuring supplies from abroad.

“The European Commission has solved the SWIFT problem quite elegantly”, Fedyakov argues. “Officially blocking SWIFT for Russia would create a precedent that would be perceived very negatively in many other countries, because they will see that they could be treated the same way one day. In addition, SWIFT is an independent organisation, so the European Commission has no direct influence on it. But because so many foreign financial groups have left the Russian market, and several more will leave in the near future, cross-border SWIFT transfers will be out of the question for Russians. Payments will only be possible through third countries with which Russia has direct financial relations. This will be a disaster for the economy.”

Oleg Itskhoki is more relaxed in his assessment of Raiffeisen’s market exit. He thinks that one bank, connected to the international system and handling all transactions, would be enough to keep the economy intact.

Raiffeisen Bank did not respond to Novaya-Europe’s question about what will happen to the bank’s employees and clients after it leaves Russia. Zinchenko notes that if a foreign bank leaves the country by transferring assets to a large Russian bank, the transition for clients, especially individuals, will be the least painful. But analysts warn that the overall situation will still get worse: Raiffeisen has traditionally been used for cross-border deals. With its departure, these are likely to fade into oblivion. Without them, the subsidiary will hardly differ from other Russian banks.

In any case, we should not expect Raiffeisen to leave any time soon. The implementation of any of the scenarios for winding up business in Russia will take no less than a month. Especially since the bank’s own management is not particularly interested in leaving, and Raiffeisen’s home country Austria is not ready to force the bank into a complete break with Russia.

Finland's Neste has dropped plans to fit carbon capture equipment to its hydrogen production unit at Porvoo in favor of boosting its electrolytic ambitions at the site, the company told S&P Global Commodity Insights.

Under its SHARC project, supported last year by Eur88 million from the EU Innovation Fund, the company is looking at a hybrid blue and green hydrogen solution at its Porvoo refinery near Helsinki. Now Neste "has decided to focus on its green hydrogen project [at Porvoo] ... and discontinue its plans on carbon capture and storage," a spokesperson said in an email. This was because of the "remarkable increase in the production capacity" for green hydrogen at the site announced on May 3. SHARC originally included a 50-MW electrolyzer producing 8,000 mt/year of renewable hydrogen, plus a CCS plant capturing 300,000-400,000 mt/year of CO2 from the refinery's existing steam methane reforming unit.

On May 3, however, Neste said it would now develop a 120-MW electrolyzer plant, producing green hydrogen from 2026. "The electricity planned to be sourced [for the electrolyzer] will be renewable and it is targeted to meet the criteria for RFNBO [renewable fuels of non-biological origin] eligibility as stated in the EU Delegated Act proposals," the spokesperson said.

The Port of Rotterdam Authority is developing a site suitable for the construction of a green hydrogen plant with up to 1 GW electrolyzer capacity, it said. The project is linked to the tender for the 2-GW IJmuiden Ver Beta offshore wind farm later this year with Dutch authorities calling for bids to integrate wind into the energy system. Both the wind farm and hydrogen plant should be operational by 2028, it said. The electrolyzer producing 60,000 kg/day of renewable hydrogen will be built on the Tweede Maasvlakte with electricity coming from its HKN offshore wind farm starting this summer.

The Port Authority's ambition is to have 2.2 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030 with existing plans amounting to around 1.35 GW, it said.

The Netherlands plans a Eur300 million ($330 million) tender for hydrogen imports under the H2Global scheme, a spokesperson for the energy ministry told S&P Global Commodity Insights. The aim would be to open the tender at the end of this or the beginning of next year, pending parliamentary and state aid approval by the European Commission, the spokesperson said. Work on the design of the tender with decisions on hydrogen carrier, derivatives, volumes, import regions and pre-qualification criteria still need to be made, they said.

Vopak has opened 16 new tankers at its Vlaardingen terminal in Rotterdam to store sustainable feedstocks for fuel production in forecast of rising demand in Europe, the Dutch company said May 10. The tanks, with a combined capacity of 64,000 cu m, are designed to store waste-based feedstocks for producing biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel. Shell, which is building a new biorefinery in Rotterdam, has signed a long-term commercial agreement to store feedstocks at Vopak's Vlaardingen terminal.

The 82,000 mt/year biorefinery, one of the largest in Europe, will produce SAF and renewable diesel from waste materials such as used cooking oil, waste animal fat, and other residual products.

TotalEnergies is to build a 25 MW, 75 MWh (three-hour duration) battery storage asset at its Antwerp refinery in Belgium, the French company said May 15. The installation, to comprise 40 containers of lithium-ion batteries supplied by TotalEnergies' subsidiary Saft, is set to enter operation by the end of 2024. "After commissioning four battery parks in France offering total energy storage capacity of 130 MWh, this project will be the Company's largest battery installation in Europe," TotalEnergies said. The Antwerp battery would benefit from the refinery site's spare land and grid connection.

Finland's Neste will double capacity at its Singapore biofuels refinery to 2.6 million mt/year by end-2023, of which up to 1 million mt/year is sustainable aviation fuel, the company said at the opening of the expanded facility May 17. This followed the completion of the $1.74 billion Singapore refinery expansion project in mid-April, which includes an "enhanced" raw material pre-treatment capacity onsite to process "more challenging" waste and residue raw materials, Neste said in a statement. Feedstock such as used cooking oil are used to produce renewable diesel at Neste's refinery in Singapore, its website said.

Neste had also agreed to acquire a stake in Changi Airport Fuel Hydrant Installation Company -- the fuel storage and infrastructure join venture in Singapore's international airport -- so that it can offer blended SAF directly to airlines at Singapore's Changi Airport. The deal is subject to the fulfilment of customary closing conditions.

Hungarian oil and gas company MOL announced on LinkedIn May 10 that it has started commercial testing of SAF in cooperation with Budapest airport, Wizz Air, and Airport Fuel Services Ltd. In a statement May 10, Wizz Air announced that three flights had taken off from Budapest airport using a 37% blend of SAF produced by Finnish refiner Neste and supplied by MOL.

Multinational chemical company INEOS has developed an ultra-thin, rigid polyethylene film made of 50% recycled plastic for use in Europe's recyclable flexible packaging market, according to a May 2 company statement, a market where weak demand for recycled polyethylene persists. The material, developed in collaboration with engineers Hosakawa Alpine, compounds recycled plastic waste and new, highly engineered, resins to create a plastic film which "will be used to manufacture recyclable single polymer flexible packaging products that replace difficult-to-recycle multimaterial packaging products".

CONVENTIONAL UPGRADES

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Greece's Motor Oil Hellas said in April 2023 that an investment in a new propylene splitter unit is "about to begin". The unit will have 100,000 mt annual capacity and is expected to be completed by 2026. It will use the existing infrastructure of the FCC unit which will switch part of the gasoline production into propylene.

** Croatia's Rijeka refinery completed planned activities during a shutdown and was starting up, it said in early May 2023. The refinery halted operations for five months between November 2022 and April 2023 while it continues with its upgrade project. During the shutdown, works will be carried out on "connecting existing units with new systems", the company said. It also clarified that "several suspensions" of operations are planned for the duration of the upgrade project, in which it is investing more than HRK4 billion ($524 million), as "the refinery cannot operate continuously while work is being carried out" on the existing and new units. The upgrade involves construction of a new residue complex, which includes a delayed coker. Works on the new residue complex started in 2020. Commissioning of the new complex is planned for 2024.

** UK-based Petrofac has secured a new EPC contract for the modernization and expansion of Orlen Lietuva's refinery in Lithuania, it said in April 2023.

"Petrofac's scope of work encompasses the design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of new facilities, as ORLEN Lietuva invests to expand the existing refinery complex," it said, adding that it has previously secured an EPC for the addition of a new residue hydrocracking unit at the refinery.

In October 2021, Petrofac was awarded another EPC contract to build a bottom of the barrel unit at the Mazeikiai refinery in Lithuania, due to be completed by the end of 2024. The construction started in August 2022. The new EPC includes the installation of a new amine regeneration unit and stabilization tower, interconnecting pipework and tie-ins to the existing refinery units, Petrofac said.

** Slovakia's Slovnaft has awarded an engineering, procurement services and construction management (EPSCM) contract for an off-gas upgrade at its Bratislava steam cracker to McDermott. The project will upgrade the existing steam cracker unit by adding a low-pressure recovery unit, increasing ethylene production capacity utilizing the off-gas from the existing production, McDermott said in a statement. Following the expansion, the capacity of the PP3 unit will increase by 33,000 mt/year to 300,000 mt/year. Construction was expected to start in the summer of 2023 and be completed in October 2024.

** Romania's Rompetrol said the cogeneration plant at the Petromidia refinery has reached "over 80%" general progress, including "around 95% progress on the engineering side, more than 96% on the procurement side and the actual construction is approaching 72%." The Kazakh-Romanian Energy Investment Fund (KREIF) "has made considerable progress in commissioning the cogeneration plant," the company said in March 2023. The project, which started in May 2021, will ensure the refinery's energy needs "exclusively from the cogeneration plant," it said. The new facility will generate approximately 80 MW of electricity. The KREIF is owned by KMG International, a subsidiary of Kazakhstan's state-owned KazMunaiGaz, and the Romanian state.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a visbreaking unit at Plock. The visbreaking unit refinery will have a capacity to produce 200,000 mt/year of diesel. Ongoing modernization of the hydrocracking and diesel hydrodesulfurization units at Plock will also increase the refinery's diesel production capacity.

PKN Orlen has bought a license and base design from US engineering company KBR for a potential bottom-of-the-barrel project. If PKN takes a final investment decision, it will construct a production complex using solvent de-asphalting and fluid catalytic cracking technologies.

Separately, PKN Orlen has signed a contract with Linde to build a new oxygen and nitrogen production unit at its Plock refinery. The unit will produce 38,500 cu m/hour of oxygen and 75,000 cu m/hour of nitrogen, supplying gas feedstock for the new Olefin III complex and other installations at Plock. The project is due to be completed by the start of 2025.

** Poland's PKN Orlen said it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil products loading terminal in Gdansk. PKN said both investments are scheduled to be commissioned by mid-2025. The hydrocracking base oils project will help the company diversify into second- and third-generation base oils.

** The expansion of Orlen Unipetrol's steam cracker at Litvinov is still ongoing, the company said Dec. 2022. The company said in October 2021 it was contracting Technip Energies to build a new steam cracker furnace to be commissioned in 2022. The construction of an 11th furnace is set to boost production capacity to 585,000 mt/year of ethylene from 545,000 mt/year. The company plans to increase total petrochemical production capacity to 1.4 million mt/year by 2030 from 900,000 mt/year.

PKN Orlen has completed the Czech Koruna 9.6 billion ($410 million) polyethylene 3 unit investment at Litvinov. The refinery's owner, Unipetrol, a 100%-owned PKN subsidiary, has taken charge of the black polyethylene unit, the second part of the investment. The first part, the natural polyethylene unit, was completed in April 2020. The polyethylene 3 unit, which can produce 270,000 mt/year of high density polyethylene, will replace production of one of the two existing production units with a capacity of 120,000 mt/year. Litvinov's polyethylene capacity will increase from 320,000 mt/year to 470,000 mt/year. PKN Orlen was launching construction of a unit at Litvinov to produce up to 26,000 mt/year of dicyclopentadiene, or DCPC, used in the automotive, construction and electronic industries. Separately, McDermott International has been awarded a contract for engineering, procurement and construction management services for an upgrade of the hydrocracker at the Litvinov refinery.

** France's Donges refinery is building a new hydrodesulfurization unit due to start up in the fourth quarter of 2023.

** OMV Petrom will build a new unit for aromatics products at its Petrobrazi refinery. The company said it will invest approximately EUR130 million ($142 million) on the new unit whose processing capacity will be around 1,500 mt/day of reformed gasoline. The existing aromatics unit, which started production in 1961, will be replaced over 2023-2025, and the new unit will be put in operation in 2026. OMV also said it has "successfully completed the transportation of four coke drums." The new drums will replace the current ones, which have been in use since 1989, and will be operational in 2023. The company is also considering other significant investments at Petrobrazi, "both in the technological efficiency of the refinery as well as in the production of second-generation biofuels," the company said.

** Repsol will build a new plant at Tarragona to produce 27,000 mt/year of cross-linkable polyethylene (XLPE) from mid-2024. It will also invest Eur18 million in an upgrade of its polyols unit, due to conclude in Q4 2023.

** Bosnia's Brod refinery has started construction of a bitumen unit. The refinery, which has been offline since 2019 for an upgrade, had been expected to restart once it was connected to a gas pipeline, allowing it to switch to gas-fired power operations. The line was connected in December 2021, but the plant remains offline. The owner has not given a reason why. A solar power facility at the plant has also been built to help power operations.

** Azerbaijan's state oil company Socar is looking to expand the capacity of its 212,000 b/d Star refinery in Turkey. Socar said it could expand Star's capacity to 13 million mt/year (261,000 b/d) by means of "flexibilities" in the refinery's design.

** Turkish construction group Tekfen Insaat said that together with partner HMB Hallesche Mitteldeutsche Bau it has signed an EPC contract with Turkey's main refiner Tupras to construct a new sulfur recovery unit at the Kirikkale refinery. Tupras' upgrade plans for its four refineries include new sulfur units at its three main refineries, Izmit, Izmir and Kirikkale. Tupras is also carrying out a revamp of the FCC unit at Izmit, which will include the installation of flue gas treatment and energy back recovery systems.

** Portugal's Galp will build a desulfurization unit with a processing capacity of 20,000 b/d at the Sines refinery. The project will allow the company to widen its crude slate.

** Greece's Hellenic Petroleum said in 2021 that Eur35 million had been approved for a capacity increase at the polypropylene production unit at Thessaloniki to 300,000 mt/year, with the implementation targeted within 2-1/2 years.

** Serbia's Pancevo refinery expects to complete its FCC project in 2023. The refinery also plans to build a unit to produce the octane enhancement chemical ETBE by 2024.

** Bulgaria's Burgas refinery has awarded a contract to US Lummus Technology for a 280,000 mt/year polypropylene plant. The deal includes a technology license as well as basic design engineering, training and services, and catalyst supply.

** ExxonMobil said it has "made a final investment decision to expand" the Fawley refinery in the UK to increase production of ultra low sulfur diesel by 45%, or 38,000 b/d. The more than $1 billion investment includes a hydrotreater to remove sulfur from diesel, supported by a hydrogen plant.

** Israel's Haifa District Court has rejected an appeal by Haifa municipality along with six other neighboring communities and environmental groups against the proposed expansion of the Bazan refinery

BIOFUEL, HYDROGEN UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** Operator Petronor said May 6 that owner Repsol and Saudi Aramco have taken a final investment decision to construct a synthetic biofuel plant at Bilbao that will be completed in 2025. The project was previously targeted for 2024.

The companies will invest Eur103 million between them to produce the fuel, which can be used in any combustion engine for road, air and sea vehicles.

The plant will be the first at industrial scale to use CO2 and green hydrogen as feedstock to output 2,100 mt/year of fuel, equal to 18,000 barrels. The project includes a 10 MW electrolyzer, which will have Enagas and Ente Vasco de Energia as partners. Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for a planned 100 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

** Greece's Helleniq Energy said in May 2023 that the pilot investment in "green" hydrogen at the Elefsis refinery "edges closer to the final investment decision," while projects for the production of biofuels, such as HVO and SAF at its refineries, are "in the implementation phase."

** OMV Petrom said May 2023 that it has signed a financing contract through the National Plan for Recovery and Resilience for the production of green hydrogen at the Petrobrazi refinery in Romania. The project involves putting into operation a capacity of 20 MW for production of hydrogen by water electrolysis, which will be powered by renewable energy. It is estimated to produce over 2,600 mt/yr. The final investment decision is due to be made in 2024 with completion expected for 2025.

** Germany's Schwedt refinery will halt fossil fuel processing and be transformed into a "hydrogen hub" producing synthetic and bio fuels and other products by 2045, the refinery's management said at a press conference, according to local media reports. The refinery, which can currently produce around 11 million mt/year of oil products, would be able to make about 1 million mt/year of synthetic aviation fuels, 1 million mt/year of methanol and high-value chemical products, and 1 million mt/year of biodiesel, ethanol and biomethane, according to the reports. In order to produce synthetic hydrocarbons, the refinery will need 800,000 mt/year of green hydrogen from 2045. By 2027 it is expected to have electrolyzer capacity of 400 MW which would be able to produce 30,000 mt/year of hydrogen, with production reaching 160,000 mt/year in 2030 and increasing further to 240,000 mt/year, renewable energy services provider Enertrag, which is working on the feasibility study for the plant's transformation together with the refinery's management, said in a statement May 9.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Repsol said it was retrofitting the hydro units in all five Spanish refineries it operates to increase its use of bio feedstock as the business was starting to give positive impetus to its refining margins. Mild hydrocracker units at A Coruna, Bilbao and Puertollano as well as hydrocrackers at Cartagena and Tarragona will all be modified with no real capex impact, CEO Josu Jon Imaz said.

Separately, Repsol would take a final investment decision in H2 2023 on 350 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity spread across Cartagena, Tarragona and Bilbao, all of which are entering their engineering phase.

** The European Commission has approved a Eur158 million Polish green hydrogen support package for Poland's Gdansk refinery under state aid rules, it said in April 2023. PKN Orlen via its LOTOS Green H2 subsidiary plans a 100 MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen used in refinery processes as well as a 50 MW solar power plant and 20 MWh battery storage, it said. The electrolyzer is expected to start operating in 2027 and gradually increase production to 13,600 mt/year.

** Finnish refiner Neste said it has decided to "proceed to the basic engineering phase" of a 120 MW electrolyzer project at its Porvoo refinery aimed to produce green hydrogen. If an investment decision is made in 2024, production could start in 2026.

The green hydrogen would be used primarily in Porvoo to replace hydrogen produced from fossil fuel and will support the company's goal "to transform the Porvoo refinery to the most sustainable refinery in Europe by 2030," it said.

Finland's Neste has successfully concluded its second series of "industrial-scale processing runs with liquefied waste plastic" at the Porvoo refinery after carrying out the first processing run in 2020. The current processing uses the existing refinery equipment but ultimately Neste aims to establish large-scale capacities to process 400,000 mt/yr of liquefied waste plastic. From 2030 it wants to process more than 1 million mt/yr of waste plastic.

The aim is part of Neste's strategic study to transform Porvoo into "a renewable and circular solutions site and possibly end crude oil refining by the mid-2030s," it also said.

The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

** Finland's Neste said in its Q1 2023 financial report that the Rotterdam expansion project is "proceeding well". Its joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, started up its first phase in February. "Together, the growth projects are targeting to increase our total nameplate capacity of renewable products to 5.5 million tons by the end of 2023," Neste said. Neste reiterated that by increasing the SAF capabilities in Singapore and Rotterdam it is "targeting the optionality" to produce up to 1.5 million mt/year of SAF in 2024, which will reach 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026 when its nameplate capacity in renewable products is expected to increase to 6.8 million mt/year.

** BP plans to invest up to Eur2 billion in a green hydrogen plant at Spanish Castellon to replace the existing fossil-based hydrogen plant, it said in February 2023. Under the project, BP said it plans a phased development of up to 2 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030. The project will also see Castellon's production of biofuels triple to 650,000 mt/year by 2030 with the green hydrogen used as a feedstock in biofuel production, specifically of SAF. The first phase of the project will see the installation of an electrolysis plant with at least 200 MW capacity operational by 2027, with production of up to 31,200 mt/year of green hydrogen. In a second phase, to be completed in 2030, the electrolysis plant would be expanded to reach a capacity of up to 2 GW. BP has created a joint venture with Iberdrola covering Spain, Portugal and the UK to produce green ammonia and methanol as well as 600,000 mt/year of hydrogen. The refinery also has a target to triple sustainable jet fuel output to 15,000 b/d as part of its overall decarbonization program.

** Cepsa said March 8 it will build a new unit to produce second generation biofuel at the Huelva refinery with an investment of Eur1 billion ($1.1 billion). The plant will produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. The biofuels will be produced from organic waste, including used cooking oil and agricultural residues.

The plant will contribute to Cepsa's strategy to reach 2.5 million mt/year of biofuel production by 2030, making it a leader in the Iberian peninsula. The total will include 800,000 mt/year of SAF.

The refinery is also planning to start up 400 MW of hydrogen production capacity by 2026, having signed agreements in January and February 2023 with local partners.

Cepsa has already signed an agreement with the Port of Rotterdam to create the first green hydrogen corridor between southern and northern Europe, allowing the export of green ammonia and methanol.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a hydrotreated vegetable oils installation at Plock. PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery. The unit will process used rapeseed oil to produce an additive to diesel or aviation fuel. The annual production of the unit will be 300,000 mt of biodiesel or aviation biofuel. The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a bioethanol unit at the company's small Polish biofuels plant, Orlen Poludnie. PKN Orlen is also constructing a hydrogen plant at its Poludnie biorefinery in Trzebinia. Annual production will be 16 million cu m, and three-quarters of that will be used to produce glycol. The remainder will be used to produce 45 kg/h of fuel-grade hydrogen for use in transport.

** PKN Orlen said its subsidiary Orlen Poludnie has signed an agreement to build a "complex of units for production of II generation bioethanol" at its biofuel refinery in Jedlicze, southern Poland. The B2G complex will include a main unit for bioethanol production and will have the capacity to produce 25,000 mt/year of bioethanol from biomass. In the next stage, a biogas plant will be built. The biomass will be mainly cereals straw sourced from Polish farmers. The bioethanol complex will also include a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant, which will generate heat for bioethanol production. The Jedlicze refinery is a small former petroleum refinery, which together with the Trzebinia refinery, was incorporated into Orlen Poludnie, the company's biofuels subsidiary.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

In Oct. 2021, Gunvor said it had agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Phillips 66 is looking at carbon capture and storage as well as electrolytic green hydrogen production to decarbonize operations at its Humber refinery in the UK, Commercial Manager for Emerging Energy Mike Wailes said Feb. 2023. The initial focus is on post-combustion capture from the refining process, including from the crude topping unit, fluid catalytic cracker and hydro-desulfurization unit, with further more expensive options coming from refueling to use hydrogen, he said.

Phillips 66 is developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to be powered by offshore wind which can be scalable to 300 MW.

The Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways in early 2022.

Phillips 66 has said previously its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Portugal's Galp said it expects to sanction key projects in 2023, including 270,000 mt/year production of HVO capacity for producing advanced biodiesel and SAF, with a final investment decision expected in the year. In terms of green hydrogen, it also expects to take FID on a 100 MW Sines hydrogen production plant during 2023, targeting an eventual roll out of up to 700 MW to the end of the decade. The 100-MW Sines electrolyzer project will target to replace existing conventional hydrogen production. Previously, Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub.

** Spain's Repsol is to build a new 25,000 mt/year production line for recycled polyethylene at its Puertollano site. The new line, which will produce high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) with a recycled plastic content of 10%-80%, was expected to come into operation by the end of 2024. Current capacity for the plastics production at the site is 16,000 mt/year. Puertollano is also due to start a first polyurethane foam recovery plant this year at Puertollano while it also has plans to build a new unit to produce 15,000 mt/year of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) to come online in 2024 with an investment of Eur105 million.

** Renewable hydrogen company Everfuel has signed an agreement in Jan. 2023 to supply oxygen to an undisclosed company from its HySynergy electrolyzer in Fredericia, Denmark, enabling a higher utilization of the plant. The conditional agreement will improve the overall utilization and efficiency of the second phase of the electrolyzer, providing a long-term revenue stream, Everfuel said. HySynergy 2.0 will extend the existing 20 MW electrolyzer with 300 MW of additional capacity by 2025. It will be developed with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia and will produce hydrogen to decarbonize industrial processes and transportation. The first 20-MW phase started hydrogen production in December, with first commercial deliveries due in 2023. The plant, adjacent to the Fredericia oil refinery, will supply renewable hydrogen to the facility and for local zero-emissions transport, Everfuel said. The plant will send 80% of the hydrogen produced to the refinery for use as a feedstock in the refining process. The remaining 20% will go to hydrogen mobility applications. Phase two is to be built in three 100-MW stages.

** Piling work for a new biofuel plant being built by Shell at the site of Europe's biggest refinery, Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam (formerly Pernis), was due to be completed around summer 2023, with the new plant expected to start up in 2024 or 2025. Shell is building an 820,000 mt/year biofuel plant in Rotterdam to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste. The facility will not use virgin palm oil as a feedstock although it will process vegetable oils, such as rapeseed, to supplement the waste feedstocks "until even more sustainable advanced feedstocks are widely available," it said.

** Repsol along with Spanish companies Naturgy and Reganosa plan to construct a hydrogen electrolyzer at Meirama, close to the A Coruna plant, with the output used to feed the refinery. The first phase of the project will see 30 MW of installed capacity by 2025 at the site of a closed thermal power plant. A subsequent upgrade will take the project to 200 MW capacity, producing 30,000 mt of green hydrogen per year. A newly installed hydrotreatment unit at Spain's A Coruna that processes vegetable and cooking oils was expected to boost biofuel output by 5,500 mt/year in 2022, with the volume rising to 10,500 mt/year by 2024.

** Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery. The contract covers engineering, procurement and construction assistance for the conversion of Grandpuits "into a zero-crude platform oriented towards SAF," it said. Once in operation, the facility will have the capacity to produce 210,000 mt/year of SAF from sustainable feedstock such as used cooking oil and animal fat. Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in Q1 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform, starting in 2024.

Separately, Air Liquide is to invest over Eur130 million ($134 million) in a low-carbon hydrogen unit at the Grandpuits biorefinery. TotalEnergies has committed to buy the hydrogen under a long-term contract to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The new reforming unit, with capacity to produce over 20,000 mt/year of hydrogen, will partly recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, in place of the natural gas it normally uses.

TotalEnergies also said that its zero-crude project at Grandpuits "is based on the development of several future-oriented activities" which include chemical recycling of plastic waste, production of biosourced and biodegradable bioplastics, production of biofuels for the aviation sector, construction of a solar farm and electricity storage by batteries. The new units will be starting up from 2022 and are expected to be operational by 2025.

** Turkey's Tupras said it had completed basic engineering studies to produce sustainable aviation fuel at its Izmir refinery using Honeywell's UOP ecofining technology. Tupras said it plans eventually to produce 400,000 mt/year of SAF, renewable diesel and other products at Izmir.

** OMV said that together with AEG Fuels it will supply SAF from its Schwechat refinery on-demand for the "general aviation segment" to be used as an alternative to conventional jet fuel at the Vienna International Airport. SAF is produced at Schwechat by co-processing Austrian used cooking oil and is supplied via a direct pipeline connection to Vienna's international airport. OMV had also supplied the first batch of SAF to Vienna International Airport for fueling Austrian Airlines aircraft. Schwechat has received the two main components for producing SAF -- the reactor and column. From mid-2023 up to 160,000 mt of liquid biomass will be converted into SAF using an innovative co-processing method, it said. "The new reactor will process substances including vegetable oil together with other feedstocks in a procedure known as co-processing. This innovative process involves refining the biogenic feedstock via a hydrogenation process using hydrogen," OMV said. In the future, the process can be used for processing other feedstock such as used cooking oil or advanced bio-fuels. OMV plans to increase its SAF sales to more than 700,000 mt/year by 2030. Separately, OMV will build the country's largest electrolysis plant at the Schwechat refinery through a joint investment with Kommunalkredit Austria AG. The plant is expected to start in H2 2023. The 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis will produce up to 1,500 mt/year of green hydrogen.

Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies will stop using palm oil at La Mede from 2023. The biorefinery has already significantly reduced the amount of palm oil it processes from 500,000 mt/year initially to 100,000 mt/year in 2021. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Turkey's Ersan Petrol is still hopeful of its plans for a 1.4 million mt/year refinery at Kahramanmaras in southeast Turkey will be able to go ahead despite repeated delays and a difficult investment climate. Project coordinator Cenk Pala said Ersan was in talks with prospective partners and sources of finance for the project and hopes to start work on the FEED study this year. The refinery is planned for a 300,000 sq m site in Kahramanmaras which holds a defunct mini refinery that will be dismantled. A pre-feasibility study by Axens has defined the configuration and capacity of the plant which will produce mainly Euro 5 diesel, Euro 5 gasoline, jet and bitumen.

** A new greenfield Porto Romano refinery in Albania will be predominantly oriented to export markets but will also be able to cover Albania's domestic demand, Helmut Mayrhofer, consultant at Larkalis said. Austria-based consultancy Larkalis is leading an international consortium working on the project which will involve building the refinery in the port town of Durres. The refinery has a two-year construction authorization and could be commissioned by end-2025, depending on international developments.

Sustainable aviation fuel is in focus in Europe amid plans to ramp up supply and production.

Shell is to supply Qatar Airways with 3,000 mt of SAF at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, as part of a wider strategy to use 10% SAF by 2030 for its fuel needs. It is part of an existing contract with Shell at Schiphol, which will see Qatar Airways use at least 5% SAF blend over the contract period of the fiscal year 2023-2024, Qatar Airways said in a statement May 31.

The EU passed the ReFuelEU aviation initiative in April, which requires fuel suppliers to blend SAF in increasing amounts, from 2% of overall fuel supplied by 2025 up to 70% by 2050.

In 2021, SAF accounted for only 0.01% or aviation fuel demand in Europe, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights data.

Meanwhile, France's TotalEnergies said it is "stepping up" production of sustainable aviation fuel at the site of its former Grandpuits refinery to 285,000 mt/year, "more than double the capacity announced in 2020." Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in the first quarter of 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform.

** Greece's Motor Oil Hellas said in April 2023 that an investment in a new propylene splitter unit is "about to begin". The unit will have 100,000 mt annual capacity and is expected to be completed by 2026. It will use the existing infrastructure of the FCC unit which will switch part of the gasoline production into propylene.

** Croatia's Rijeka refinery completed planned activities during a shutdown and was starting up, it said in early May 2023. The refinery halted operations for five months between November 2022 and April 2023 while it continues with its upgrade project. During the shutdown, works will be carried out on "connecting existing units with new systems", the company said. It also clarified that "several suspensions" of operations are planned for the duration of the upgrade project, in which it is investing more than HRK4 billion ($524 million), as "the refinery cannot operate continuously while work is being carried out" on the existing and new units. The upgrade involves construction of a new residue complex, which includes a delayed coker. Works on the new residue complex started in 2020. Commissioning of the new complex is planned for 2024.

** UK-based Petrofac has secured a new EPC contract for the modernization and expansion of Orlen Lietuva's refinery in Lithuania, it said in April 2023.

"Petrofac's scope of work encompasses the design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of new facilities, as ORLEN Lietuva invests to expand the existing refinery complex," it said, adding that it has previously secured an EPC for the addition of a new residue hydrocracking unit at the refinery.

In October 2021, Petrofac was awarded another EPC contract to build a bottom of the barrel unit at the Mazeikiai refinery in Lithuania, due to be completed by the end of 2024. The construction started in August 2022. The new EPC includes the installation of a new amine regeneration unit and stabilization tower, interconnecting pipework and tie-ins to the existing refinery units, Petrofac said.

** Slovakia's Slovnaft has awarded an engineering, procurement services and construction management (EPSCM) contract for an off-gas upgrade at its Bratislava steam cracker to McDermott. The project will upgrade the existing steam cracker unit by adding a low-pressure recovery unit, increasing ethylene production capacity utilizing the off-gas from the existing production, McDermott said in a statement. Following the expansion, the capacity of the PP3 unit will increase by 33,000 mt/year to 300,000 mt/year. Construction was expected to start in the summer of 2023 and be completed in October 2024.

** Romania's Rompetrol said the cogeneration plant at the Petromidia refinery has reached "over 80%" general progress, including "around 95% progress on the engineering side, more than 96% on the procurement side and the actual construction is approaching 72%." The Kazakh-Romanian Energy Investment Fund (KREIF) "has made considerable progress in commissioning the cogeneration plant," the company said in March 2023. The project, which started in May 2021, will ensure the refinery's energy needs "exclusively from the cogeneration plant," it said. The new facility will generate approximately 80 MW of electricity. The KREIF is owned by KMG International, a subsidiary of Kazakhstan's state-owned KazMunaiGaz, and the Romanian state.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a visbreaking unit at Plock. The visbreaking unit refinery will have a capacity to produce 200,000 mt/year of diesel. Ongoing modernization of the hydrocracking and diesel hydrodesulfurization units at Plock will also increase the refinery's diesel production capacity.

PKN Orlen has bought a license and base design from US engineering company KBR for a potential bottom-of-the-barrel project. If PKN takes a final investment decision, it will construct a production complex using solvent de-asphalting and fluid catalytic cracking technologies.

Separately, PKN Orlen has signed a contract with Linde to build a new oxygen and nitrogen production unit at its Plock refinery. The unit will produce 38,500 cu m/hour of oxygen and 75,000 cu m/hour of nitrogen, supplying gas feedstock for the new Olefin III complex and other installations at Plock. The project is due to be completed by the start of 2025.

** Poland's PKN Orlen said it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil products loading terminal in Gdansk. PKN said both investments are scheduled to be commissioned by mid-2025. The hydrocracking base oils project will help the company diversify into second- and third-generation base oils.

** The expansion of Orlen Unipetrol's steam cracker at Litvinov is still ongoing, the company said Dec. 2022. The company said in October 2021 it was contracting Technip Energies to build a new steam cracker furnace to be commissioned in 2022. The construction of an 11th furnace is set to boost production capacity to 585,000 mt/year of ethylene from 545,000 mt/year. The company plans to increase total petrochemical production capacity to 1.4 million mt/year by 2030 from 900,000 mt/year.

PKN Orlen has completed the Czech Koruna 9.6 billion ($410 million) polyethylene 3 unit investment at Litvinov. The refinery's owner, Unipetrol, a 100%-owned PKN subsidiary, has taken charge of the black polyethylene unit, the second part of the investment. The first part, the natural polyethylene unit, was completed in April 2020. The polyethylene 3 unit, which can produce 270,000 mt/year of high density polyethylene, will replace production of one of the two existing production units with a capacity of 120,000 mt/year. Litvinov's polyethylene capacity will increase from 320,000 mt/year to 470,000 mt/year. PKN Orlen was launching construction of a unit at Litvinov to produce up to 26,000 mt/year of dicyclopentadiene, or DCPC, used in the automotive, construction and electronic industries. Separately, McDermott International has been awarded a contract for engineering, procurement and construction management services for an upgrade of the hydrocracker at the Litvinov refinery.

** France's Donges refinery is building a new hydrodesulfurization unit due to start up in the fourth quarter of 2023.

** OMV Petrom will build a new unit for aromatics products at its Petrobrazi refinery. The company said it will invest approximately EUR130 million ($142 million) on the new unit whose processing capacity will be around 1,500 mt/day of reformed gasoline. The existing aromatics unit, which started production in 1961, will be replaced over 2023-2025, and the new unit will be put in operation in 2026. OMV also said it has "successfully completed the transportation of four coke drums." The new drums will replace the current ones, which have been in use since 1989, and will be operational in 2023. The company is also considering other significant investments at Petrobrazi, "both in the technological efficiency of the refinery as well as in the production of second-generation biofuels," the company said.

** Repsol will build a new plant at Tarragona to produce 27,000 mt/year of cross-linkable polyethylene (XLPE) from mid-2024. It will also invest Eur18 million in an upgrade of its polyols unit, due to conclude in Q4 2023.

** Bosnia's Brod refinery has started construction of a bitumen unit. The refinery, which has been offline since 2019 for an upgrade, had been expected to restart once it was connected to a gas pipeline, allowing it to switch to gas-fired power operations. The line was connected in December 2021, but the plant remains offline. The owner has not given a reason why. A solar power facility at the plant has also been built to help power operations.

** Azerbaijan's state oil company Socar is looking to expand the capacity of its 212,000 b/d Star refinery in Turkey. Socar said it could expand Star's capacity to 13 million mt/year (261,000 b/d) by means of "flexibilities" in the refinery's design.

** Turkish construction group Tekfen Insaat said that together with partner HMB Hallesche Mitteldeutsche Bau it has signed an EPC contract with Turkey's main refiner Tupras to construct a new sulfur recovery unit at the Kirikkale refinery. Tupras' upgrade plans for its four refineries include new sulfur units at its three main refineries, Izmit, Izmir and Kirikkale. Tupras is also carrying out a revamp of the FCC unit at Izmit, which will include the installation of flue gas treatment and energy back recovery systems.

** Portugal's Galp will build a desulfurization unit with a processing capacity of 20,000 b/d at the Sines refinery. The project will allow the company to widen its crude slate.

BIOFUEL, HYDROGEN UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** France's TotalEnergies said it is "stepping up" production of sustainable aviation fuel at the site of its former Grandpuits refinery in France to 285,000 mt/year, "more than double the capacity announced in 2020." TotalEnergies will also construct biomethane production unit at the zero-crude platform at Grandpuits, with annual capacity of 80 GWh, which will be supplied with organic waste from the biorefinery. The company said the bioplastic production project will not be pursued following the decision by its partner Cobrion.

Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in the first quarter of 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform,

Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery.

Separately, Air Liquide is to invest over Eur130 million ($134 million) in a low-carbon hydrogen unit at the Grandpuits biorefinery. TotalEnergies has committed to buy the hydrogen under a long-term contract to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The new reforming unit, with capacity to produce over 20,000 mt/year of hydrogen, will partly recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, in place of the natural gas it normally uses.

** BP's Castellon and Cepsa's Huelva refineries have been awarded around Eur15 million ($16.5 million) apiece from Spanish energy transition funds to build hydrogen electrolyzers. The project at Castellon is a 25 MW electrolyzer (named gH2 project), which will be developed together with Spain's Iberdrola at a total cost of around Eur43 million. BP previously said it plans to have 60 MW of electrolyzer capacity in operation at the site by 2025, 200 MW by 2027 and 2 GW by 2030.

BP also plans Castellon's production of biofuels triple to 650,000 mt/year by 2030 with the green hydrogen used as a feedstock in biofuel production, specifically of SAF. The refinery also has a target to triple sustainable jet fuel output to 15,000 b/d as part of its overall decarbonization program.

The project at Huelva is for 52.5 MW of electrolysis capacity in a project costing Eur59 million. During Q1 Cepsa announced agreements with fertilizer group Fertiberia and domestic gas and renewable groups Enagas and Alter Enersun to reach 400 MW of hydrogen capacity at Huelva by 2026. The company is seeking more partners to reach a target of 1 GW of capacity by 2030 under its Andalusia Hydrogen Valley project.

The company is expected to start work soon on a new Eur100-million dock at Huelva for its export operations of biofuels from 2026 and green hydrogen from 2027.

Cepsa has already signed an agreement with the Port of Rotterdam to create the first green hydrogen corridor between southern and northern Europe, allowing the export of green ammonia and methanol.

Cepsa said March 8 it will build a new unit to produce second generation biofuel at the Huelva refinery with an investment of Eur1 billion ($1.1 billion). The plant will produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. The biofuels will be produced from organic waste, including used cooking oil and agricultural residues.

The plant will contribute to Cepsa's strategy to reach 2.5 million mt/year of biofuel production by 2030, making it a leader in the Iberian peninsula. The total will include 800,000 mt/year of SAF.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Operator Petronor said May 6 that owner Repsol and Saudi Aramco have taken a final investment decision to construct a synthetic biofuel plant at Bilbao that will be completed in 2025. The project was previously targeted for 2024.

The companies will invest Eur103 million between them to produce the fuel, which can be used in any combustion engine for road, air and sea vehicles.

The plant will be the first at industrial scale to use CO2 and green hydrogen as feedstock to output 2,100 mt/year of fuel, equal to 18,000 barrels. The project includes a 10 MW electrolyzer, which will have Enagas and Ente Vasco de Energia as partners. Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for a planned 100 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

** Greece's Helleniq Energy said in May 2023 that the pilot investment in "green" hydrogen at the Elefsis refinery "edges closer to the final investment decision," while projects for the production of biofuels, such as HVO and SAF at its refineries, are "in the implementation phase."

** OMV Petrom said May 2023 that it has signed a financing contract through the National Plan for Recovery and Resilience for the production of green hydrogen at the Petrobrazi refinery in Romania. The project involves putting into operation a capacity of 20 MW for production of hydrogen by water electrolysis, which will be powered by renewable energy. It is estimated to produce over 2,600 mt/yr. The final investment decision is due to be made in 2024 with completion expected for 2025.

** Germany's Schwedt refinery will halt fossil fuel processing and be transformed into a "hydrogen hub" producing synthetic and bio fuels and other products by 2045, the refinery's management said at a press conference, according to local media reports. The refinery, which can currently produce around 11 million mt/year of oil products, would be able to make about 1 million mt/year of synthetic aviation fuels, 1 million mt/year of methanol and high-value chemical products, and 1 million mt/year of biodiesel, ethanol and biomethane, according to the reports. In order to produce synthetic hydrocarbons, the refinery will need 800,000 mt/year of green hydrogen from 2045. By 2027 it is expected to have electrolyzer capacity of 400 MW which would be able to produce 30,000 mt/year of hydrogen, with production reaching 160,000 mt/year in 2030 and increasing further to 240,000 mt/year, renewable energy services provider Enertrag, which is working on the feasibility study for the plant's transformation together with the refinery's management, said in a statement May 9.

** Repsol said it was retrofitting the hydro units in all five Spanish refineries it operates to increase its use of bio feedstock as the business was starting to give positive impetus to its refining margins. Mild hydrocracker units at A Coruna, Bilbao and Puertollano as well as hydrocrackers at Cartagena and Tarragona will all be modified with no real capex impact, CEO Josu Jon Imaz said.

Separately, Repsol would take a final investment decision in H2 2023 on 350 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity spread across Cartagena, Tarragona and Bilbao, all of which are entering their engineering phase.

** The European Commission has approved a Eur158 million Polish green hydrogen support package for Poland's Gdansk refinery under state aid rules, it said in April 2023. PKN Orlen via its LOTOS Green H2 subsidiary plans a 100 MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen used in refinery processes as well as a 50 MW solar power plant and 20 MWh battery storage, it said. The electrolyzer is expected to start operating in 2027 and gradually increase production to 13,600 mt/year.

** Finnish refiner Neste said it has decided to "proceed to the basic engineering phase" of a 120 MW electrolyzer project at its Porvoo refinery aimed to produce green hydrogen. If an investment decision is made in 2024, production could start in 2026.

The green hydrogen would be used primarily in Porvoo to replace hydrogen produced from fossil fuel and will support the company's goal "to transform the Porvoo refinery to the most sustainable refinery in Europe by 2030," it said.

Finland's Neste has successfully concluded its second series of "industrial-scale processing runs with liquefied waste plastic" at the Porvoo refinery after carrying out the first processing run in 2020. The current processing uses the existing refinery equipment but ultimately Neste aims to establish large-scale capacities to process 400,000 mt/yr of liquefied waste plastic. From 2030 it wants to process more than 1 million mt/yr of waste plastic.

The aim is part of Neste's strategic study to transform Porvoo into "a renewable and circular solutions site and possibly end crude oil refining by the mid-2030s," it also said.

The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

** Finland's Neste said in its Q1 2023 financial report that the Rotterdam expansion project is "proceeding well". Its joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, started up its first phase in February. "Together, the growth projects are targeting to increase our total nameplate capacity of renewable products to 5.5 million tons by the end of 2023," Neste said. Neste reiterated that by increasing the SAF capabilities in Singapore and Rotterdam it is "targeting the optionality" to produce up to 1.5 million mt/year of SAF in 2024, which will reach 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026 when its nameplate capacity in renewable products is expected to increase to 6.8 million mt/year.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a hydrotreated vegetable oils installation at Plock. PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery. The unit will process used rapeseed oil to produce an additive to diesel or aviation fuel. The annual production of the unit will be 300,000 mt of biodiesel or aviation biofuel. The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a bioethanol unit at the company's small Polish biofuels plant, Orlen Poludnie. PKN Orlen is also constructing a hydrogen plant at its Poludnie biorefinery in Trzebinia. Annual production will be 16 million cu m, and three-quarters of that will be used to produce glycol. The remainder will be used to produce 45 kg/h of fuel-grade hydrogen for use in transport.

** PKN Orlen said its subsidiary Orlen Poludnie has signed an agreement to build a "complex of units for production of II generation bioethanol" at its biofuel refinery in Jedlicze, southern Poland. The B2G complex will include a main unit for bioethanol production and will have the capacity to produce 25,000 mt/year of bioethanol from biomass. In the next stage, a biogas plant will be built. The biomass will be mainly cereals straw sourced from Polish farmers. The bioethanol complex will also include a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant, which will generate heat for bioethanol production. The Jedlicze refinery is a small former petroleum refinery, which together with the Trzebinia refinery, was incorporated into Orlen Poludnie, the company's biofuels subsidiary.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

In Oct. 2021, Gunvor said it had agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Phillips 66 is looking at carbon capture and storage as well as electrolytic green hydrogen production to decarbonize operations at its Humber refinery in the UK, Commercial Manager for Emerging Energy Mike Wailes said Feb. 2023. The initial focus is on post-combustion capture from the refining process, including from the crude topping unit, fluid catalytic cracker and hydro-desulfurization unit, with further more expensive options coming from refueling to use hydrogen, he said.

Phillips 66 is developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to be powered by offshore wind which can be scalable to 300 MW.

The Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways in early 2022.

Phillips 66 has said previously its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Portugal's Galp said it expects to sanction key projects in 2023, including 270,000 mt/year production of HVO capacity for producing advanced biodiesel and SAF, with a final investment decision expected in the year. In terms of green hydrogen, it also expects to take FID on a 100 MW Sines hydrogen production plant during 2023, targeting an eventual roll out of up to 700 MW to the end of the decade. The 100-MW Sines electrolyzer project will target to replace existing conventional hydrogen production. Previously, Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub.

** Spain's Repsol is to build a new 25,000 mt/year production line for recycled polyethylene at its Puertollano site. The new line, which will produce high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) with a recycled plastic content of 10%-80%, was expected to come into operation by the end of 2024. Current capacity for the plastics production at the site is 16,000 mt/year. Puertollano is also due to start a first polyurethane foam recovery plant this year at Puertollano while it also has plans to build a new unit to produce 15,000 mt/year of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) to come online in 2024 with an investment of Eur105 million.

** Renewable hydrogen company Everfuel has signed an agreement in Jan. 2023 to supply oxygen to an undisclosed company from its HySynergy electrolyzer in Fredericia, Denmark, enabling a higher utilization of the plant. The conditional agreement will improve the overall utilization and efficiency of the second phase of the electrolyzer, providing a long-term revenue stream, Everfuel said. HySynergy 2.0 will extend the existing 20 MW electrolyzer with 300 MW of additional capacity by 2025. It will be developed with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia and will produce hydrogen to decarbonize industrial processes and transportation. The first 20-MW phase started hydrogen production in December, with first commercial deliveries due in 2023. The plant, adjacent to the Fredericia oil refinery, will supply renewable hydrogen to the facility and for local zero-emissions transport, Everfuel said. The plant will send 80% of the hydrogen produced to the refinery for use as a feedstock in the refining process. The remaining 20% will go to hydrogen mobility applications. Phase two is to be built in three 100-MW stages.

** Piling work for a new biofuel plant being built by Shell at the site of Europe's biggest refinery, Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam (formerly Pernis), was due to be completed around summer 2023, with the new plant expected to start up in 2024 or 2025. Shell is building an 820,000 mt/year biofuel plant in Rotterdam to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste. The facility will not use virgin palm oil as a feedstock although it will process vegetable oils, such as rapeseed, to supplement the waste feedstocks "until even more sustainable advanced feedstocks are widely available," it said.

** Repsol along with Spanish companies Naturgy and Reganosa plan to construct a hydrogen electrolyzer at Meirama, close to the A Coruna plant, with the output used to feed the refinery. The first phase of the project will see 30 MW of installed capacity by 2025 at the site of a closed thermal power plant. A subsequent upgrade will take the project to 200 MW capacity, producing 30,000 mt of green hydrogen per year. A newly installed hydrotreatment unit at Spain's A Coruna that processes vegetable and cooking oils was expected to boost biofuel output by 5,500 mt/year in 2022, with the volume rising to 10,500 mt/year by 2024.

** Turkey's Tupras said it had completed basic engineering studies to produce sustainable aviation fuel at its Izmir refinery using Honeywell's UOP ecofining technology. Tupras said it plans eventually to produce 400,000 mt/year of SAF, renewable diesel and other products at Izmir.

** Croatia's INA is studying various options for its Sisak refinery, including a biorefinery, biogas plant and production of pure hydrogen.

** Italy's Eni said it was "investigating the opportunity to build a new bio-refinery at Eni's industrial site in Livorno." It will be Eni's third biorefinery in Italy after converting its Gela and Venice refineries into biofuel plants. Eni said its feasibility study involves building "three new plants for the production of hydrogenated biofuel: a biogenic feedstock pre-treatment unit, a 500,000 mt/year Ecofining plant and a plant for the production of hydrogen from methane gas." The design of the three plants will be completed by 2023 and construction by 2025. Local officials welcomed the potential conversion of the Livorno refinery into a biorefinery as it would maintain "the current workforce and the entire production chain."

** Italy's Eni has started producing SAF at its Taranto refinery in southern Italy, as part of its commitment to decarbonize all its products and processes by 2050. Eni plans to increase its bio-refining capacity to 5 million-6 million mt/year by 2050. Eni targets its SAF capacity to reach at least 500,000 mt/year by 2030. Eni said its SAF production will continue to grow with the start-up of over 10,000 mt/year of SAF from its Livorno refinery using bio-components produced in Eni's existing Gela and Venice bio-refineries. In 2024, Eni plans to launch SAF production at the Gela bio-refinery, where a project is underway for a further 150,000 mt/year of SAF production from 100% renewable raw materials by 2025.

** Italy's Eni said that it will install a 20 MW electrolyzer at its Gela biorefinery and a 10 MW electrolyzer at its Taranto refinery. The electrolyzers will be part of a project to develop green hydrogen by Enel Green Power and Eni which will receive public funding approved by the European Commission.

** Ineos has awarded a design contract for a planned 190,000 mt/year low-carbon hydrogen production plant at its Grangemouth refining and petrochemical site in Scotland to engineering company Atkins. The plant is expected to be operational by 2030.

** Essar, the owner of the UK's Stanlow refinery, said it has received a hydrogen-powered furnace, which is the first in the UK. The furnace has been commissioned by Essar Oil UK "as it transitions to run its operations on hydrogen as part of HyNet, the UK's leading decarbonization cluster," it said. The furnace, which will run on 100% hydrogen fuel from 2026, "forms a central part of Essar's strategy at Stanlow to become the UK's first low-carbon refinery." The furnace will replace three gas-fired furnaces at the plant's crude distillation unit. Essar is also developing 300,000 cu m of biofuel storage capacity at the site, allowing customers to store, blend and distribute biofuels for the road, aviation and marine sectors. It will become the UK's largest biofuels storage facility when completed.

** OMV Petrom will start producing SAF at its Petrobrazi refinery, which will become the first refinery in Romania to produce the fuel. The refinery will produce SAF by coprocessing locally produced rapeseed oil. In the future, it aims to increase the production capacities and produce sustainable fuels based on various waste feedstocks, such as used cooking oil. "Our goal is that, in 2030, to have an annual combined production of SAF and HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil) of about 450 thousand tons," Radu Caprau, member of the Executive Board responsible for Refining & Marketing said.

** Repsol and partners Enerkem and Agbar have presented a project to transform 400,000 mt/year of urban waste to 220,000 mt/year methanol at Tarragona, which should start up in 2025 with an investment of Eur250 million. Spain's Tarragona has started on a series of energy transition projects, including the manufacture of biofuel for aviation and an advanced biofuels plant, which is already under construction. The refinery plans to build a 100-MW hydrogen electrolyzer by 2025.

** Hungarian oil and gas group MOL will build a 10-MW electrolyzer for renewable hydrogen production at its Danube refinery in Szazhalombatta, Hungary. The electrolyzers from US company Plug Power will produce 1,600 mt/year of green hydrogen, with operations starting in 2023.

** OMV said that together with AEG Fuels it will supply SAF from its Schwechat refinery on-demand for the "general aviation segment" to be used as an alternative to conventional jet fuel at the Vienna International Airport. SAF is produced at Schwechat by co-processing Austrian used cooking oil and is supplied via a direct pipeline connection to Vienna's international airport. OMV had also supplied the first batch of SAF to Vienna International Airport for fueling Austrian Airlines aircraft. Schwechat has received the two main components for producing SAF -- the reactor and column. From mid-2023 up to 160,000 mt of liquid biomass will be converted into SAF using an innovative co-processing method, it said. "The new reactor will process substances including vegetable oil together with other feedstocks in a procedure known as co-processing. This innovative process involves refining the biogenic feedstock via a hydrogenation process using hydrogen," OMV said. In the future, the process can be used for processing other feedstock such as used cooking oil or advanced bio-fuels. OMV plans to increase its SAF sales to more than 700,000 mt/year by 2030. Separately, OMV will build the country's largest electrolysis plant at the Schwechat refinery through a joint investment with Kommunalkredit Austria AG. The plant is expected to start in H2 2023. The 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis will produce up to 1,500 mt/year of green hydrogen.

** Germany's Bayernoil is looking at producing SAF from sewage sludge. It could convert 100,000 mt of sewage sludge into SAF annually under Project Bayosine. The processing, which involves pyrolisis, can be done in a new unit at the Vohburg site of the plant.

** Sweden's Preem aims to expand the HVO capacity at its Gothenburg plant from 320,000 cu m/year to 1.3 million cu m/year in 2026. "This is planned to take place in a completely new facility designed to produce renewable vehicle fuels and aviation fuels with great flexibility," it said. In its Lysekil plant, production of HVO from the Synsat plant "was the highest to date," the company said. Preem is rebuilding the existing Synsat plant, so it can produce renewable raw materials and replace part of the fossil production. It is expected to reach renewable production capacity of 950,000 cu m/year by 2024.

** Finland's UPM expects its Leuna biorefinery in Germany to be operational by the end of 2023 and ramp up in 2024. Construction of the facility, which will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals, started in 2020. Its total annual capacity will be 220,000 mt bio-monoethylene glycol and lignin-based renewable functional fillers. It will also produce monopropylene glycol and industrial sugars made from sustainably harvested beechwood sourced regionally in Germany.

** Greece's Motor Oil Hellas said its Corinth refinery by 2030 aims to enhance its pure hydrogen infrastructure through demonstration and scale-up of green hydrogen. In the long term, it aims to be a "large producer of clean hydrogen".

** France's TotalEnergies said it has "successfully started production" of SAF at its Gonfreville refinery in Normandy. The new site complements the biojet production capacities of the company's La Mede refinery and the Oudalle plant. All the biojet will be supplied to French airports and will be produced from waste and residue sourced from the circular economy. La Mede, in the south of France, and Oudalle, near Le Havre, began producing SAF in April 2021. La Mede stopped processing crude oil at the end of 2016 and was converted into a bio plant in 2019.

** Repsol's Cartagena has started construction of its planned second-generation biofuel plant at the nearby to the refinery Escombreras facility, which should result in the production of 250,000 mt/year of biodiesel from waste from mid-2023. The company will invest Eur200 million in the project that would output biodiesel, biojet, bionaphtha and biopropane, allowing an overall CO2 reduction of 900,000 mt/year. As part of its drive to decarbonize the refinery, Repsol also plans to build a 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer at Cartagena, with a target date of 2025.

** Orsted and BP are to jointly develop a 50 MW renewable hydrogen project at BP's Lingen refinery in Germany. The project, expected to be operational in 2024, would comprise a 50 MW electrolyzer capable of generating 9,000 mt/year of hydrogen, 20% of the refinery's current fossil-based hydrogen consumption. The electrolyzer is expected to be powered by an Orsted North Sea offshore wind farm. The partners have a longer-term ambition to build more than 500 MW of renewable hydrogen capacity at Lingen, providing renewable hydrogen to meet all the refinery's hydrogen demand and provide feedstock for future synthetic fuel production.

** Italian energy company Eni and SEA, the operator of Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, have signed an agreement to supply SAF for commercial flights, as a step towards accelerating the "ecological transition" of the two airports. Eni plans to develop Eni Biojet which will be made "exclusively" from used cooking oil or animal fats and can be "used in a blend with conventional jet fuel of up to 50%," Umberto Carrara, Director of Green/Traditional Refining and Market at Eni said. The company plans to produce around 200,000 mt/year by 2024 and double the production by 2030.

** BP has partnered with Dutch green hydrogen company HyCC to develop its 250-MW H2-Fifty electrolyzer project in Rotterdam. The companies will next select a technology partner for the previously announced renewable hydrogen project and begin environmental studies, with a final investment decision expected in 2023. The project is expected to come online in 2025. The renewable hydrogen produced at the facility will replace fossil-based feedstock at BP's Rotterdam refinery and other industries in the area. The plant will be situated in the Maasvlakte area of Rotterdam.

** Russia's Lukoil said in December 2021 that it has signed memorandum of intent with Rusatom Overseas, part of the Rosatom Group, to cooperate in the production and supply of green hydrogen for the company's Petrotel refinery in Ploesti, Romania.

** Varo Energy's Cressier refinery in Switzerland will use solar panel generated electricity by 19,000 photovoltaic panels for a "significant portion" of the electricity it consumes. Varo Energy Group and Groupe E will build the "most powerful ground-mounted solar facility in Switzerland" with an installed capacity of 7.7 MW. It will be built in the industrial zone east of the refinery. At full power the park will be able to supply more than 60% of the refinery's needs.

** ExxonMobil, Macquarie's Green Investment Group, and SGN are studying the potential for a low-carbon hydrogen hub centered around ExxonMobil's Fawley refinery on the UK's south coast. Initial hydrogen production could be around 4.3 TWh/year from 2030. Hydrogen demand in the Southampton industrial cluster around the refinery could reach 37 TWh by 2050.

** Italy's Saras is working on activating a green hydrogen plant for a total of 20 MW. Saras is building the green hydrogen plant with Italian utility Enel. The hydrogen produced would be used at the Sarroch refinery. It is currently provided by the IGCC complex and two reforming units on the industrial site.

** The Refhyne II consortium, developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for Shell's Rheinland refinery in Germany at its Wesseling site, has received a Eur32.4 million grant from the EU. The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies will stop using palm oil at La Mede from 2023. The biorefinery has already significantly reduced the amount of palm oil it processes from 500,000 mt/year initially to 100,000 mt/year in 2021. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen at Gdansk. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

"Trade and economic cooperation, although slowed down amid the pressure of the politically motivated sanction, is still significant. According to statistics, Russia is still among Austria’s major trade partners, being sixth in terms of trade," he said in an interview with the Express portal.

However, in his words, political relations with Austria are undergoing a "serious stress test."

"As is known, official Vienna not only joined the West’s destructive policy and supported all sanction packages, but also took an active part in their development. <…> The work of all bilateral; mechanisms and practically all contacts have been frozen by the Austrian side. Today, there is no subject matter for dialogue with Vienna," he stated.

According to Lyubinsky, the Austrian government "is ruining the constructive basis for bilateral relations, which has been built for decades, and is limiting the prospect for their normalization in the foreseeable future."

Mansion in Austrian Kitzbühel Bought by Sanctioned Russian Oligarch

(Vindobona) Russian oligarch and confidant of President Vladimir Putin, Arkady Rotenberg, is said to have financed a house in Kitzbühel, where Putin's daughter is also said to have spent time, according to media reports.

According to internal documents cited by the Standard and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP),[https://www.occrp.org/en/rotenberg-files/documents-suggest-billionaire-oligarch-financed-purchase-of-austrian-chalet-used-by-putins-daughter] the money for the purchase of the villa was provided by a Cypriot company associated with Rotenberg.

Sanctions were already imposed on Putin's childhood friend by the EU and the U.S. in 2014. According to the report, the house in Kitzbühel belongs to the Cypriot company Wayblue Investments Limited, based in Nicosia. According to the research, the purchase was financed by a loan from Cyprus-based Olpon Investments, which Rotenberg has owned since 2003. Olpon transferred 11.5 million euros to the then Meridian Trade Bank in Latvia, which in turn was attributable to the Rotenbergs, reports suggest. The money went from there to Wayblue. It is unclear who owns the Wayblue company. According to the report, the shell company is controlled by another Cypriot shell company.

The shell company is controlled by another Cypriot company called Velidom Limited. This is a so-called trust service provider that manages assets for third parties. At the time of the real estate purchase, two other trust service providers were registered as owners of Wayblue, again the actual ownership cannot be found out.

As the Standard reported[https://www.derstandard.at/story/3000000175251/eine-oligarchenvilla-in-kitzbuehel-fuer-putins-tochter?ref=article], Neighbors, however, had indicated that Putin's daughter Maria Voronza was repeatedly seen in the house. This strengthens the suspicion that Arkady Rotenberg may have financed the purchase of the luxury property to do Vladimir Putin a favor - by making it available to his family.

The Austrian State Protection and Intelligence Directorate (DSN) has been unsuccessfully trying to determine the true owner of the property since April 2022. The city of Kitzbühel also appears clueless, although the Tyrolean opposition politician Markus Sint (List Fritz) has long demanded clarification. No one has been registered at the address since 2013, according to a letter from the city to Sint in the spring of last year.

Mayor Klaus Winkler (ÖVP) withdrew his promise to talk to the Standard [https://www.derstandard.at/story/3000000175251/eine-oligarchenvilla-in-kitzbuehel-fuer-putins-tochter?ref=article]. In writing, he merely let it be known in response to a long list of questions: "It is not known whether persons sanctioned by the EU have real estate assets in Kitzbühel." Nothing is known about the owners of Wayblue and no reference to the involvement of Russian persons can be found.

In any case, an Austrian real estate company sold the property in January 2013 for 10.8 million euros to the Cypriot company Wayblue Investments Limited. Since then, the chalet has belonged to this company, which has its headquarters in Nicosia. In Austria, Wayblue Investments is represented by Josef Wieser, a lawyer licensed to practice in Russia and specializing, among other things, in EU sanctions.

Childhood friends

The relationship between Putin and Rotenberg is an extremely close one. The two have been friends since their youth in St. Petersburg, when they trained in judo together. Since then, Putin has risen to become president, and Rotenberg has become the "king of state contracts."

Thanks to billion-dollar deals with the Russian state, Rotenberg became rich. His fortune is estimated at more than three billion euros. Probably the most important order: the construction of the prestigious bridge to the Crimea, which the oligarch built at Putin's request and was named a "Hero of Labor" for it. In the end, the project was the reason for the EU to sanction the oligarch.

Reactions on the part of Austrian political parties

Stephanie Krisper, the NEOS spokeswoman for internal affairs, lamented Austria's low level of involvement in the Russia sanctions. She said the case once again confirms that more extensive research and investigation would be possible if sufficiently qualified personnel were available. "The fact that the federal government has done nothing so far suggests that it has no increased interest in harming Russia," Krisper said, , according to ORF.[https://orf.at/stories/3320953/]

The Greens are asking big questions in light of the case. "It is incomprehensible to me why investigative journalists have to do the research work that should be the responsibility of state authorities - in this case, the Interior Ministry," said MP Nina Tomaselli, according to ORF.[https://orf.at/#/stories/3320953/]

MP Kai Jan Krainer (SPÖ) demanded, , according to ORF[https://orf.at/stories/3320953/], that "trustees must disclose the true beneficial owner in sanction matters". If this does not happen, the authorities should have a reasonable presumption that a sanctioned Russian is the owner, which should result in the freezing of assets.

Sustainable aviation fuel remained in focus in European refinery news amid ever-growing plans to ramp up supply and production across the continent.

French President Emmanuel Macron has announced the construction of a bio-refinery in Lacq in southwest France as part of a series of investments to decarbonize aviation, according to French media reports.

The start-up Elyse Energy will build the plant with partners Avril, Axens, Bionext et IFP Investissements. The plant will have a total capacity of 110,000 mt/year of biofuels including 75,000 mt/year of sustainable aviation fuel and 35,000 mt/year of bio-naphtha.

Speaking at Safran Aircraft Engines factory in Villaroche, France, on June 16, macron said: "We just secured total capacity of SAF production of 500,000 mt per year in France by 2030."

Separately, France's TotalEnergies said it was "stepping up" production of sustainable aviation fuel at the site of its former Grandpuits refinery in France to 285,000 mt/year, "more than double the capacity announced in 2020".

TotalEnergies also said it was "actively responding to a call from its aviation customers to increase production of sustainable aviation fuel" and from 2028 will produce 500,000 mt/year at its sites in France.

Elsewhere, Finland's Neste expects to produce up to 1.5 million mt/year of SAF in 2024, which will reach 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026.

Shell is to supply Qatar Airways with 3,000 mt of SAF at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, as part of a wider strategy to use 10% SAF by 2030 for its fuel needs.

It is part of an existing contract with Shell at Schiphol, which will see Qatar Airways use at least a 5% SAF blend over the contract period of fiscal year 2023-24, Qatar Airways said May 31.

The EU passed the ReFuelEU aviation initiative in April, which requires fuel suppliers to blend SAF in increasing amounts, from 2% of overall fuel supplied by 2025 up to 70% by 2050.

CONVENTIONAL UPGRADES

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Greece's Motor Oil Hellas said in April 2023 that an investment in a new propylene splitter unit is "about to begin". The unit will have 100,000 mt annual capacity and is expected to be completed by 2026. It will use the existing infrastructure of the FCC unit which will switch part of the gasoline production into propylene.

** Croatia's Rijeka refinery completed planned activities during a shutdown and was starting up, it said in early May 2023. The refinery halted operations for five months between November 2022 and April 2023 while it continues with its upgrade project. During the shutdown, works will be carried out on "connecting existing units with new systems", the company said. It also clarified that "several suspensions" of operations are planned for the duration of the upgrade project, in which it is investing more than HRK4 billion ($524 million), as "the refinery cannot operate continuously while work is being carried out" on the existing and new units. The upgrade involves construction of a new residue complex, which includes a delayed coker. Works on the new residue complex started in 2020. Commissioning of the new complex is planned for 2024.

** UK-based Petrofac has secured a new EPC contract for the modernization and expansion of Orlen Lietuva's refinery in Lithuania, it said in April 2023.

"Petrofac's scope of work encompasses the design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of new facilities, as ORLEN Lietuva invests to expand the existing refinery complex," it said, adding that it has previously secured an EPC for the addition of a new residue hydrocracking unit at the refinery.

In October 2021, Petrofac was awarded another EPC contract to build a bottom of the barrel unit at the Mazeikiai refinery in Lithuania, due to be completed by the end of 2024. The construction started in August 2022. The new EPC includes the installation of a new amine regeneration unit and stabilization tower, interconnecting pipework and tie-ins to the existing refinery units, Petrofac said.

** Slovakia's Slovnaft has awarded an engineering, procurement services and construction management (EPSCM) contract for an off-gas upgrade at its Bratislava steam cracker to McDermott. The project will upgrade the existing steam cracker unit by adding a low-pressure recovery unit, increasing ethylene production capacity utilizing the off-gas from the existing production, McDermott said in a statement. Following the expansion, the capacity of the PP3 unit will increase by 33,000 mt/year to 300,000 mt/year. Construction was expected to start in the summer of 2023 and be completed in October 2024.

** Romania's Rompetrol said the cogeneration plant at the Petromidia refinery has reached "over 80%" general progress, including "around 95% progress on the engineering side, more than 96% on the procurement side and the actual construction is approaching 72%." The Kazakh-Romanian Energy Investment Fund (KREIF) "has made considerable progress in commissioning the cogeneration plant," the company said in March 2023. The project, which started in May 2021, will ensure the refinery's energy needs "exclusively from the cogeneration plant," it said. The new facility will generate approximately 80 MW of electricity. The KREIF is owned by KMG International, a subsidiary of Kazakhstan's state-owned KazMunaiGaz, and the Romanian state.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a visbreaking unit at Plock. The visbreaking unit refinery will have a capacity to produce 200,000 mt/year of diesel. Ongoing modernization of the hydrocracking and diesel hydrodesulfurization units at Plock will also increase the refinery's diesel production capacity.

PKN Orlen has bought a license and base design from US engineering company KBR for a potential bottom-of-the-barrel project. If PKN takes a final investment decision, it will construct a production complex using solvent de-asphalting and fluid catalytic cracking technologies.

Separately, PKN Orlen has signed a contract with Linde to build a new oxygen and nitrogen production unit at its Plock refinery. The unit will produce 38,500 cu m/hour of oxygen and 75,000 cu m/hour of nitrogen, supplying gas feedstock for the new Olefin III complex and other installations at Plock. The project is due to be completed by the start of 2025.

** Poland's PKN Orlen said it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil product loading terminal in Gdansk. PKN said both investments are scheduled to be commissioned by mid-2025. The hydrocracking base oils project will help the company diversify into second- and third-generation base oils.

** The expansion of Orlen Unipetrol's steam cracker at Litvinov is still ongoing, the company said Dec. 2022. The company said in October 2021 it was contracting Technip Energies to build a new steam cracker furnace to be commissioned in 2022. The construction of an 11th furnace is set to boost production capacity to 585,000 mt/year of ethylene from 545,000 mt/year. The company plans to increase total petrochemical production capacity to 1.4 million mt/year by 2030 from 900,000 mt/year.

PKN Orlen has completed the Czech Koruna 9.6 billion ($410 million) polyethylene 3 unit investment at Litvinov. The refinery's owner, Unipetrol, a 100%-owned PKN subsidiary, has taken charge of the black polyethylene unit, the second part of the investment. The first part, the natural polyethylene unit, was completed in April 2020. The polyethylene 3 unit, which can produce 270,000 mt/year of high density polyethylene, will replace production of one of the two existing production units with a capacity of 120,000 mt/year. Litvinov's polyethylene capacity will increase from 320,000 mt/year to 470,000 mt/year. PKN Orlen was launching construction of a unit at Litvinov to produce up to 26,000 mt/year of dicyclopentadiene, or DCPC, used in the automotive, construction and electronic industries. Separately, McDermott International has been awarded a contract for engineering, procurement and construction management services for an upgrade of the hydrocracker at the Litvinov refinery.

** France's Donges refinery is building a new hydrodesulfurization unit due to start up in the fourth quarter of 2023.

** OMV Petrom will build a new unit for aromatics products at its Petrobrazi refinery. The company said it will invest Eur130 million ($142 million) on the new unit whose processing capacity will be around 1,500 mt/day of reformed gasoline. The existing aromatics unit, which started production in 1961, will be replaced over 2023-2025, and the new unit will be put in operation in 2026. OMV also said it has "successfully completed the transportation of four coke drums." The new drums will replace the current ones, which have been in use since 1989, and will be operational in 2023. The company is also considering other significant investments at Petrobrazi, "both in the technological efficiency of the refinery as well as in the production of second-generation biofuels," the company said.

** Repsol will build a new plant at Tarragona to produce 27,000 mt/year of cross-linkable polyethylene (XLPE) from mid-2024. It will also invest Eur18 million in an upgrade of its polyols unit, due to conclude in Q4 2023.

** Bosnia's Brod refinery has started construction of a bitumen unit. The refinery, which has been offline since 2019 for an upgrade, had been expected to restart once it was connected to a gas pipeline, allowing it to switch to gas-fired power operations. The line was connected in December 2021, but the plant remains offline. A solar power facility at the plant has also been built to help power operations.

** Azerbaijan's state oil company Socar is looking to expand the capacity of its 212,000 b/d Star refinery in Turkey. Socar said it could expand Star's capacity to 13 million mt/year (261,000 b/d) by means of "flexibilities" in the refinery's design.

** Turkish construction group Tekfen Insaat said that together with partner HMB Hallesche Mitteldeutsche Bau it has signed an EPC contract with Turkey's main refiner Tupras to construct a new sulfur recovery unit at the Kirikkale refinery. Tupras' upgrade plans for its four refineries include new sulfur units at its three main refineries, Izmit, Izmir and Kirikkale. Tupras is also carrying out a revamp of the FCC unit at Izmit, which will include the installation of flue gas treatment and energy back recovery systems.

** Portugal's Galp will build a desulfurization unit with a processing capacity of 20,000 b/d at the Sines refinery. The project will allow the company to widen its crude slate.

** Greece's Hellenic Petroleum said in 2021 that Eur35 million had been approved for a capacity increase at the polypropylene production unit at Thessaloniki to 300,000 mt/year, with the implementation targeted within 2-1/2 years.

** Serbia's Pancevo refinery expects to complete its FCC project in 2023. The refinery also plans to build a unit to produce the octane enhancement chemical ETBE by 2024.

** Bulgaria's Burgas refinery has awarded a contract to US Lummus Technology for a 280,000 mt/year polypropylene plant. The deal includes a technology license as well as basic design engineering, training and services, and catalyst supply.

** ExxonMobil said it has "made a final investment decision to expand" the Fawley refinery in the UK to increase production of ultra low sulfur diesel by 45%, or 38,000 b/d. The more than $1 billion investment includes a hydrotreater to remove sulfur from diesel, supported by a hydrogen plant.

** Israel's Haifa District Court has rejected an appeal by Haifa municipality along with six other neighboring communities and environmental groups against the proposed expansion of the Bazan refinery.

BIOFUEL, HYDROGEN UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** French President Emmanuel Macron has announced the construction of a bio-refinery in Lacq in southwest France as part of a series of investments to decarbonize aviation, according to French media reports. The start-up Elyse Energy will build the plant with partners Avril, Axens, Bionext et IFP Investissements. The plant will have a total capacity of 110,000 mt/year of biofuels including 75,000 mt/year of sustainable aviation fuel and 35,000 mt/year of bio-naphtha.

** France's TotalEnergies said it is "stepping up" production of sustainable aviation fuel at the site of its former Grandpuits refinery in France to 285,000 mt/year, "more than double the capacity announced in 2020." TotalEnergies will also construct biomethane production unit at the zero-crude platform at Grandpuits, with annual capacity of 80 GWh, which will be supplied with organic waste from the biorefinery.

The company said the bioplastic production project will not be pursued following the decision by its partner Cobrion.

Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in the first quarter of 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform.

Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery.

Separately, Air Liquide is to invest over Eur130 million in a low-carbon hydrogen unit at the Grandpuits biorefinery. TotalEnergies has committed to buy the hydrogen under a long-term contract to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The new reforming unit, with capacity to produce over 20,000 mt/year of hydrogen, will partly recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, in place of the natural gas it normally uses.

** France's TotalEnergies said it has signed an agreement with VNG, a German natural gas distribution company, to start green hydrogen supply to its Leuna refinery in Germany which will contribute to its decarbonization. The hydrogen will be produced from renewable electricity at a 30 MW electrolyzer operated by VNG with its partner Uniper. The pipeline connection with the electrolyzer in Bad Lauchstadt will "give the Leuna refinery access to the future European hydrogen infrastructure and the international markets for green hydrogen."

** France's TotalEnergies said June 19 it is "actively responding to a call from its aviation customers to increase production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)" and from 2028 will produce 500,000 mt/year of SAF at its sites in France. The volume, which will come from its Grandpuits, Gonfreville and La Mede plants, will be "enough to cover the gradual increase in the European SAF blending mandate, set at 6% for 2030."

Grandpuits will be able to produce 210,000 mt/year of SAF as of 2025 and further 75,000 mt/year by 2027. At the Gonfreville refinery in Normandy the company started coprocessing SAF from used cooking oil. It plans to increase annual production to 40,000 mt from 2025. It will also produce additional 150,000 mt/year by coprocessing HVO biodiesel produced at La Mede.

Biodiesel produced at the biorefinery La Mede is already used at the Oudalle plant near Le Havre to make SAF.

Meanwhile TotalEnergies is studying a new investment to have the capacity to process by 2024 at La Mede 100% waste from circular economy, such as used cooking oil and animal fat to produce biofuels and SAF by coprocessing.

La Mede stopped processing crude oil at the end of 2016 and was converted into a bio plant in 2019.

** Finland's Neste said in June 2023 it is ramping up production at its recently expanded Singapore renewables facility and expects to reach its design capacity in the coming months. The Singapore expansion, which started up in the second half of April, will bring the full design capacity of the site to 2.6 million mt/year, including up to 1 million mt/year SAF.

Its joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, which started up its first phase in February, is moving towards the second phase, which will bring a wider pool of feedstocks, Neste officials said during a Capital Markets Day June 20.

The plant will reach full capacity as the third phase is ramped up towards the end of 2023 and early 2024.

It has previously said Martinez' nameplate capacity is 2.1 million mt/year.

Neste has also decided to expand the Rotterdam facility and the construction is "well underway."

The expansion is set to add 1.3 million mt/year to a total of 2.7 million mt/year.

By increasing its SAF capabilities it expects to produce up to 1.5 million mt/year of SAF in 2024, which will reach 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026.

Neste's production capacity for renewable products is set to increase to 5.5 million mt/year at the beginning of 2024 due to the expansion at Singapore and the Martinez joint venture.

When completed, the Rotterdam expansion project will further increase the total capacity to 6.8 million mt/year by the end of 2026.

** Finland's Neste has made the final investment decision to build upgrading facilities for liquefied plastic waste at its Porvoo refinery, it said June 2023. The facility will have a capacity to upgrade 150,000 mt/year of liquefied plastic waste which can then be used as high-quality feedstock for new plastics. It is due to be finalized in the first half of 2025.

"We have developed our capability to process circular raw material at the Porvoo refinery over the recent years and are now set to build a respective facility," said Markku Korvenranta, Executive Vice President in Neste's Oil Products.

Neste started processing liquefied waste plastic at Porvoo in 2020 as trial runs. The company has said it aims to process more than 1 million mt/year of plastic waste from 2030.

Neste aims to make its Porvoo refinery the most sustainable in Europe by 2030 and possibly end crude refining by the mid-2030s. The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

Separately, Neste said it has decided to "proceed to the basic engineering phase" of a 120 MW electrolyzer project at Porvoo aimed to produce green hydrogen. If an investment decision is made in 2024, production could start in 2026. The green hydrogen would be used primarily in Porvoo to replace hydrogen produced from fossil fuel and will support the company's goal "to transform the Porvoo refinery to the most sustainable refinery in Europe by 2030," it said.

** Galp's Sines refinery has received a favorable environmental impact assessment from Portugal's Environment Agency (APA) for its proposed 100 MW green hydrogen electrolyzer and associated storage. The unit will be able to produce up to 14,000 mt/year of hydrogen, according to the specifications.

Construction was expected to take two years at a cost of Eur217 million. The company said in May it expected to take a final investment decision on the unit during 2023.

The hydrogen would be used principally for internal refinery use, but Galp's plans include a potential expansion to 600 MW, which it would integrate into a wider hydrogen project for the region, GreenH2Atlantic, which includes a separate 100 MW electrolyzer together with EDP as part of a conversion of the nearby halted coal plant.

Portugal's Galp has also said it expects to sanction key projects in 2023, including 270,000 mt/year production of HVO capacity for producing advanced biodiesel and SAF, with a final investment decision expected in the year. Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub.

** Cepsa has signed a partnership agreement to incorporate Norway's Yara Clean Ammonia in the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley in southern Spain. The company will be involved with a new green ammonia plant at San Roque, where it plans to invest Eur1 billion. The plant will be the largest in Europe, Cepsa said, with production capacity of 750,000 mt/year, which will prevent 3 million mt/year of CO2 emissions.

Under the agreement, Yara Clean Ammonia will supply Cepsa with green ammonia, allowing Cepsa to establish a green hydrogen corridor and serve industrial and maritime customers in Rotterdam and Central Europe. Cepsa has already signed a deal with Netherlands' Gasunie to gain access to its hydrogen network connecting Rotterdam to industrial clusters in Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.

The partnership is the first that Cepsa has announced for San Roque, where it has announced a target of reaching 1 GW of electrolyzer capacity by 2028.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** BP's Castellon and Cepsa's Huelva refineries have been awarded around Eur15 million apiece from Spanish energy transition funds to build hydrogen electrolyzers. The project at Castellon is a 25 MW electrolyzer (named gH2 project), which will be developed together with Spain's Iberdrola at a total cost of around Eur43 million. BP previously said it plans to have 60 MW of electrolyzer capacity in operation at the site by 2025, 200 MW by 2027 and 2 GW by 2030.

BP also plans Castellon's production of biofuels triple to 650,000 mt/year by 2030 with the green hydrogen used as a feedstock in biofuel production, specifically of SAF. The refinery also has a target to triple sustainable jet fuel output to 15,000 b/d as part of its overall decarbonization program.

The project at Huelva is for 52.5 MW of electrolysis capacity in a project costing Eur59 million. During Q1 Cepsa announced agreements with fertilizer group Fertiberia and domestic gas and renewable groups Enagas and Alter Enersun to reach 400 MW of hydrogen capacity at Huelva by 2026. The company is seeking more partners to reach a target of 1 GW of capacity by 2030 under its Andalusia Hydrogen Valley project.

The company is expected to start work soon on a new Eur100-million dock at Huelva for its export operations of biofuels from 2026 and green hydrogen from 2027.

Cepsa said March 2023 it will build a new unit to produce second generation biofuel at the Huelva refinery with an investment of Eur1 billion. The plant will produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. The biofuels will be produced from organic waste, including used cooking oil and agricultural residues.

The plant will contribute to Cepsa's strategy to reach 2.5 million mt/year of biofuel production by 2030, making it a leader in the Iberian peninsula. The total will include 800,000 mt/year of SAF.

** Operator Petronor said May 2023 that owner Repsol and Saudi Aramco have taken a final investment decision to construct a synthetic biofuel plant at Bilbao that will be completed in 2025. The project was previously targeted for 2024.

The companies will invest Eur103 million between them to produce the fuel, which can be used in any combustion engine for road, air and sea vehicles.

The plant will be the first at industrial scale to use CO2 and green hydrogen as feedstock to output 2,100 mt/year of fuel, equal to 18,000 barrels. The project includes a 10 MW electrolyzer, which will have Enagas and Ente Vasco de Energia as partners. Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for a planned 100 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

** Greece's Helleniq Energy said in May 2023 that the pilot investment in "green" hydrogen at the Elefsis refinery "edges closer to the final investment decision," while projects for the production of biofuels, such as HVO and SAF at its refineries, are "in the implementation phase."

** OMV Petrom said May 2023 that it has signed a financing contract through the National Plan for Recovery and Resilience for the production of green hydrogen at the Petrobrazi refinery in Romania. The project involves putting into operation a capacity of 20 MW for production of hydrogen by water electrolysis, which will be powered by renewable energy. It is estimated to produce over 2,600 mt/year. The final investment decision is due to be made in 2024 with completion expected for 2025.

** Germany's Schwedt refinery will halt fossil fuel processing and be transformed into a "hydrogen hub" producing synthetic and biofuels and other products by 2045, the refinery's management said at a press conference, according to local media reports. The refinery, which can currently produce around 11 million mt/year of oil products, would be able to make about 1 million mt/year of synthetic aviation fuels, 1 million mt/year of methanol and high-value chemical products, and 1 million mt/year of biodiesel, ethanol and biomethane, according to the reports. In order to produce synthetic hydrocarbons, the refinery will need 800,000 mt/year of green hydrogen from 2045. By 2027 it is expected to have electrolyzer capacity of 400 MW which would be able to produce 30,000 mt/year of hydrogen, with production reaching 160,000 mt/year in 2030 and increasing further to 240,000 mt/year, renewable energy services provider Enertrag, which is working on the feasibility study for the plant's transformation together with the refinery's management, said in a statement May 9.

** Repsol said it was retrofitting the hydro units in all five Spanish refineries it operates to increase its use of bio feedstock as the business was starting to give positive impetus to its refining margins. Mild hydrocracker units at A Coruna, Bilbao and Puertollano as well as hydrocrackers at Cartagena and Tarragona will all be modified with no real capex impact, CEO Josu Jon Imaz said.

Separately, Repsol would take a final investment decision in H2 2023 on 350 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity spread across Cartagena, Tarragona and Bilbao, all of which are entering their engineering phase.

** The European Commission has approved a Eur158 million Polish green hydrogen support package for Poland's Gdansk refinery under state aid rules, it said in April 2023. PKN Orlen via its LOTOS Green H2 subsidiary plans a 100 MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen used in refinery processes as well as a 50 MW solar power plant and 20 MWh battery storage, it said. The electrolyzer is expected to start operating in 2027 and gradually increase production to 13,600 mt/year.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a hydrotreated vegetable oils installation at Plock. PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery. The unit will process used rapeseed oil to produce an additive to diesel or aviation fuel. The annual production of the unit will be 300,000 mt of biodiesel or aviation biofuel. The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a bioethanol unit at the company's small Polish biofuels plant, Orlen Poludnie. PKN Orlen is also constructing a hydrogen plant at its Poludnie biorefinery in Trzebinia. Annual production will be 16 million cu m, and three-quarters of that will be used to produce glycol. The remainder will be used to produce 45 kg/h of fuel-grade hydrogen for use in transport.

** PKN Orlen said its subsidiary Orlen Poludnie has signed an agreement to build a "complex of units for production of II generation bioethanol" at its biofuel refinery in Jedlicze, southern Poland. The B2G complex will include a main unit for bioethanol production and will have the capacity to produce 25,000 mt/year of bioethanol from biomass. In the next stage, a biogas plant will be built. The biomass will be mainly cereals straw sourced from Polish farmers. The bioethanol complex will also include a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant, which will generate heat for bioethanol production. The Jedlicze refinery is a small former petroleum refinery, which together with the Trzebinia refinery, was incorporated into Orlen Poludnie, the company's biofuels subsidiary.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

In Oct. 2021, Gunvor said it had agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Phillips 66 is looking at carbon capture and storage as well as electrolytic green hydrogen production to decarbonize operations at its Humber refinery in the UK, Commercial Manager for Emerging Energy Mike Wailes said Feb. 2023. The initial focus is on post-combustion capture from the refining process, including from the crude topping unit, fluid catalytic cracker and hydro-desulfurization unit, with further more expensive options coming from refueling to use hydrogen, he said.

Phillips 66 is developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to be powered by offshore wind which can be scalable to 300 MW.

The Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways in early 2022.

Phillips 66 has said previously its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Spain's Repsol is to build a new 25,000 mt/year production line for recycled polyethylene at its Puertollano site. The new line, which will produce high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) with a recycled plastic content of 10%-80%, was expected to come into operation by the end of 2024. Current capacity for the plastics production at the site is 16,000 mt/year. Puertollano is also due to start a first polyurethane foam recovery plant this year at Puertollano while it also has plans to build a new unit to produce 15,000 mt/year of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) to come online in 2024 with an investment of Eur105 million.

** Renewable hydrogen company Everfuel has signed an agreement in Jan. 2023 to supply oxygen to an undisclosed company from its HySynergy electrolyzer in Fredericia, Denmark, enabling a higher utilization of the plant. The conditional agreement will improve the overall utilization and efficiency of the second phase of the electrolyzer, providing a long-term revenue stream, Everfuel said. HySynergy 2.0 will extend the existing 20 MW electrolyzer with 300 MW of additional capacity by 2025. It will be developed with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia and will produce hydrogen to decarbonize industrial processes and transportation. The first 20-MW phase started hydrogen production in December, with first commercial deliveries due in 2023. The plant, adjacent to the Fredericia oil refinery, will supply renewable hydrogen to the facility and for local zero-emissions transport, Everfuel said. The plant will send 80% of the hydrogen produced to the refinery for use as a feedstock in the refining process. The remaining 20% will go to hydrogen mobility applications. Phase two is to be built in three 100-MW stages.

Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen at Gdansk. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

LAUNCHES

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Turkey's Ersan Petrol is still hopeful of its plans for a 1.4 million mt/year refinery at Kahramanmaras in southeast Turkey will be able to go ahead despite repeated delays and a difficult investment climate. Project coordinator Cenk Pala said Ersan was in talks with prospective partners and sources of finance for the project and hopes to start work on the FEED study this year. The refinery is planned for a 300,000 sq m site in Kahramanmaras which holds a defunct mini refinery that will be dismantled. A pre-feasibility study by Axens has defined the configuration and capacity of the plant which will produce mainly Euro 5 diesel, Euro 5 gasoline, jet and bitumen.

** A new greenfield Porto Romano refinery in Albania will be oriented to export markets but will also be able to cover Albania's domestic demand, Helmut Mayrhofer, consultant at Larkalis said. Austria-based consultancy Larkalis is leading an international consortium working on the project which will involve building the refinery in the port town of Durres. The refinery has a two-year construction authorization and could be commissioned by end-2025, depending on international developments.

** Azeri state oil company Socar is considering developing a second refinery in Turkey, in addition to its existing 214,000 b/d Star refinery at Aliaga on Turkey's central Aegean coast.

A number of companies have recently announced plastic recycling projects.

ExxonMobil has appointed engineering firm Kent as its front end engineering design contractor, to expand advanced plastic recycling capacity across seven sites. Kent will provide FEED services for ExxonMobil's advanced recycling facilities in Baytown, Texas; Beaumont, Texas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Joliet, Illinois; Sarnia, Canada; Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and Antwerp, Belgium, Kent said in a statement June 27. The roll-out of recycling capacity follows successful trials at ExxonMobil's facility at Baytown, where Kent designed the plastics recycling program.

Meanwhile, petrochemicals producer Ineos aims to incorporate at least 850,000 mt of recycled and bio-attributed material in its polymers by 2030, the company said June 29 in a sustainability report. The fresh target comes on top of existing ones, including offering polyolefin products for packaging with at least 50% recycled content by 2025 and using 30% recycled content on average in polystyrene packaging in Europe by 2025, but comes amid headwinds in plastic recycling. While the announcement aligns with increasing momentum among companies to beef up their environmental credentials, petrochemicals market sources are expecting weak recycled polymer demand to persist through the second half of 2023 following an unexpectedly underwhelming start to the summer buying season.

Separately, Ineos Group has announced a potential reorganization of its aromatics production operations at its Doel site near Antwerp, Belgium, citing "difficult market conditions" and a need to strengthen the competitiveness of its phenol business. The Doel facility is the world's largest phenol production plant, with a nameplate capacity of 680,000 mt/year, according to Ineos. The plant produces phenol, acetone and alpha-methylstyrene (AMS), using feedstock cumene. Production operations at Doel were not restarted following the completion of a maintenance turnaround at the plant in the fall of 2022, Ineos said. "A combination of unprecedented energy prices, high inflation and a cyclical slowdown have considerably weakened industrial demand for chemical products. End-users of phenol and acetone have substantially reduced their production. Customers are also facing increased competition and imports from suppliers from Asia," it said in a statement June 29.

In other news, the UK should introduce a carbon border tax to boost the country's competitiveness in the energy transition and to reduce risk of carbon leakage, amid headwinds for refiners in the region, the UK Petroleum Industry Association said June 30. The UK has higher carbon and energy costs than most competitor countries, poorer incentives to develop low carbon technologies, and a policy environment that does not offer enough investor certainty, the UKPIA said June 30.

"A well-designed carbon levy in the form of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), is needed to ensure importers have equivalent costs for carbon emissions as UK manufacturers have to face," it said.

In addition, the UK government should match the financial support offered to decarbonization projects in the EU, US and other competitor jurisdictions, the UKPIA said. "The UK's refiners are vital to the UK's plans to meet net zero by producing the low carbon liquid fuels, hydrogen and industrial carbon capture the country needs," UKPIA CEO Elizabeth de Jong said in its statement. "But to invest at the scale required, they need a level playing field with countries with less stringent environmental standards or who have more financial support."

CONVENTIONAL UPGRADES

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Greece's Motor Oil Hellas said in April 2023 that an investment in a new propylene splitter unit is "about to begin". The unit will have 100,000 mt annual capacity and is expected to be completed by 2026. It will use the existing infrastructure of the FCC unit which will switch part of the gasoline production into propylene.

** Croatia's Rijeka refinery completed planned activities during a shutdown and was starting up, it said in early May 2023. The refinery halted operations for five months between November 2022 and April 2023 while it continues with its upgrade project. During the shutdown, works will be carried out on "connecting existing units with new systems", the company said. It also clarified that "several suspensions" of operations are planned for the duration of the upgrade project, in which it is investing more than HRK4 billion ($524 million), as "the refinery cannot operate continuously while work is being carried out" on the existing and new units. The upgrade involves construction of a new residue complex, which includes a delayed coker. Works on the new residue complex started in 2020. Commissioning of the new complex is planned for 2024.

** UK-based Petrofac has secured a new EPC contract for the modernization and expansion of Orlen Lietuva's refinery in Lithuania, it said in April 2023.

"Petrofac's scope of work encompasses the design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of new facilities, as ORLEN Lietuva invests to expand the existing refinery complex," it said, adding that it has previously secured an EPC for the addition of a new residue hydrocracking unit at the refinery.

In October 2021, Petrofac was awarded another EPC contract to build a bottom of the barrel unit at the Mazeikiai refinery in Lithuania, due to be completed by the end of 2024. The construction started in August 2022. The new EPC includes the installation of a new amine regeneration unit and stabilization tower, interconnecting pipework and tie-ins to the existing refinery units, Petrofac said.

** Slovakia's Slovnaft has awarded an engineering, procurement services and construction management (EPSCM) contract for an off-gas upgrade at its Bratislava steam cracker to McDermott. The project will upgrade the existing steam cracker unit by adding a low-pressure recovery unit, increasing ethylene production capacity utilizing the off-gas from the existing production, McDermott said in a statement. Following the expansion, the capacity of the PP3 unit will increase by 33,000 mt/year to 300,000 mt/year. Construction was expected to start in the summer of 2023 and be completed in October 2024.

** Romania's Rompetrol said the cogeneration plant at the Petromidia refinery has reached "over 80%" general progress, including "around 95% progress on the engineering side, more than 96% on the procurement side and the actual construction is approaching 72%." The Kazakh-Romanian Energy Investment Fund (KREIF) "has made considerable progress in commissioning the cogeneration plant," the company said in March 2023. The project, which started in May 2021, will ensure the refinery's energy needs "exclusively from the cogeneration plant," it said. The new facility will generate approximately 80 MW of electricity. The KREIF is owned by KMG International, a subsidiary of Kazakhstan's state-owned KazMunaiGaz, and the Romanian state.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a visbreaking unit at Plock. The visbreaking unit refinery will have a capacity to produce 200,000 mt/year of diesel. Ongoing modernization of the hydrocracking and diesel hydrodesulfurization units at Plock will also increase the refinery's diesel production capacity.

PKN Orlen has bought a license and base design from US engineering company KBR for a potential bottom-of-the-barrel project. If PKN takes a final investment decision, it will construct a production complex using solvent de-asphalting and fluid catalytic cracking technologies.

Separately, PKN Orlen has signed a contract with Linde to build a new oxygen and nitrogen production unit at its Plock refinery. The unit will produce 38,500 cu m/hour of oxygen and 75,000 cu m/hour of nitrogen, supplying gas feedstock for the new Olefin III complex and other installations at Plock. The project is due to be completed by the start of 2025.

** Poland's PKN Orlen said it would invest around Zloty 2 billion ($460 million) to build a hydrocracking unit with a capacity of 400,000 mt/year and an oil product loading terminal in Gdansk. PKN said both investments are scheduled to be commissioned by mid-2025. The hydrocracking base oils project will help the company diversify into second- and third-generation base oils.

** The expansion of Orlen Unipetrol's steam cracker at Litvinov is still ongoing, the company said Dec. 2022. The company said in October 2021 it was contracting Technip Energies to build a new steam cracker furnace to be commissioned in 2022. The construction of an 11th furnace is set to boost production capacity to 585,000 mt/year of ethylene from 545,000 mt/year. The company plans to increase total petrochemical production capacity to 1.4 million mt/year by 2030 from 900,000 mt/year.

PKN Orlen has completed the Czech Koruna 9.6 billion ($410 million) polyethylene 3 unit investment at Litvinov. The refinery's owner, Unipetrol, a 100%-owned PKN subsidiary, has taken charge of the black polyethylene unit, the second part of the investment. The first part, the natural polyethylene unit, was completed in April 2020. The polyethylene 3 unit, which can produce 270,000 mt/year of high density polyethylene, will replace production of one of the two existing production units with a capacity of 120,000 mt/year. Litvinov's polyethylene capacity will increase from 320,000 mt/year to 470,000 mt/year. PKN Orlen was launching construction of a unit at Litvinov to produce up to 26,000 mt/year of dicyclopentadiene, or DCPC, used in the automotive, construction and electronic industries. Separately, McDermott International has been awarded a contract for engineering, procurement and construction management services for an upgrade of the hydrocracker at the Litvinov refinery.

** France's Donges refinery is building a new hydrodesulfurization unit due to start up in the fourth quarter of 2023.

** OMV Petrom will build a new unit for aromatics products at its Petrobrazi refinery. The company said it will invest Eur130 million ($142 million) on the new unit whose processing capacity will be around 1,500 mt/day of reformed gasoline. The existing aromatics unit, which started production in 1961, will be replaced over 2023-2025, and the new unit will be put in operation in 2026. OMV also said it has "successfully completed the transportation of four coke drums." The new drums will replace the current ones, which have been in use since 1989, and will be operational in 2023. The company is also considering other significant investments at Petrobrazi, "both in the technological efficiency of the refinery as well as in the production of second-generation biofuels," the company said.

BIOFUEL, HYDROGEN UPGRADES

NEW AND REVISED ENTRIES

** France's TotalEnergies said June 28 that it will invest Eur70 million in its La Mede biorefinery during its first big maintenance in 2024. The aim of the investment is to enable the refinery to process more used cooking oil and animal fat into biofuels. Since 2019, La Mede has been capable of producing 500,000 mt/year of renewable diesel. The investment is part of the company's objective to achieve 75% waste from circular economy as well as the acceleration of production of sustainable aviation fuel.

** Italy's Sarpom refinery has inaugurated the start of production of advanced biofuel will be produced from second-generation biomass, local media reported.

** France's TotalEnergies said in late June it was inaugurating a solar power plant at its former Grandpuits refinery as well as a battery energy storage park. The two projects are part of its strategy to transform Grandpuits into a multi-energy and zero crude platform. The solar plant generates 31 GWh of green electricity annually. The storage system has 43 MWh capacity.

TotalEnergies said it is "stepping up" production of sustainable aviation fuel at the site of its former Grandpuits refinery in France to 285,000 mt/year, "more than double the capacity announced in 2020." TotalEnergies will also construct biomethane production unit at the zero-crude platform at Grandpuits, with annual capacity of 80 GWh, which will be supplied with organic waste from the biorefinery.

The company said the bioplastic production project will not be pursued following the decision by its partner Cobrion.

Grandpuits, near Paris, stopped refining in the first quarter of 2021 and will be converted to a zero-oil platform.

Technip Energies has been awarded a contract by TotalEnergies for the production of sustainable aviation fuel at the Grandpuits refinery.

Separately, Air Liquide is to invest over Eur130 million in a low-carbon hydrogen unit at the Grandpuits biorefinery. TotalEnergies has committed to buy the hydrogen under a long-term contract to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The new reforming unit, with capacity to produce over 20,000 mt/year of hydrogen, will partly recycle residual biogas from the Grandpuits biorefinery, in place of the natural gas it normally uses.

** Spain's Repsol plans to commission the country's largest hydrogen electrolyzer at its Tarragona refinery in 2026 after the project was granted European financing from the Innovation Fund program, the company said July 2023.

The 150-MW project is part of the Hydrogen Valley of Catalonia and the Ebro Hydrogen Corridor and is included in the Repsol-led SHYNE consortium. Repsol leads the consortium which counts Enagas Renovable, Iqoxe and Messer as partners.

Following the first phase of the project, a second phase starting from 2027 could boost renewable hydrogen production capacity to 1 GW, Repsol said.

Repsol has previously said it would take a final investment decision in H2 2023 on 350 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity spread across Cartagena, Tarragona and Bilbao, all of which are entering their engineering phase.

** Lummus Technology said June 2023 that it has agreed with Hungary's MOL Group to cooperate in "the deployment and integration of chemical recycling of plastics at MOL's assets in Hungary and Slovakia." "Chemical recycling of plastics is part of MOL's commitment to collect close to 5 million tonnes of municipal solid waste, which includes the treatment and related investments," the companies said in a statement.

Lummus will provide MOL "its advanced waste plastic pyrolysis technology, which effectively converts plastic waste into high-value chemicals and feedstocks, creating circularity," the statement said, adding that MOL plans to build a production portfolio of over 100,000 mt/yr recycled plastic materials.

Separately, MOL will build a 10-MW electrolyzer for renewable hydrogen production at its Danube refinery in Szazhalombatta, Hungary. The electrolyzers from US company Plug Power will produce 1,600 mt/year of green hydrogen, with operations starting in 2023.

EXISTING ENTRIES

** French President Emmanuel Macron has announced the construction of a bio-refinery in Lacq in southwest France as part of a series of investments to decarbonize aviation, according to French media reports. The start-up Elyse Energy will build the plant with partners Avril, Axens, Bionext et IFP Investissements. The plant will have a total capacity of 110,000 mt/year of biofuels including 75,000 mt/year of sustainable aviation fuel and 35,000 mt/year of bio-naphtha.

** France's TotalEnergies said it has signed an agreement with VNG, a German natural gas distribution company, to start green hydrogen supply to its Leuna refinery in Germany which will contribute to its decarbonization. The hydrogen will be produced from renewable electricity at a 30 MW electrolyzer operated by VNG with its partner Uniper. The pipeline connection with the electrolyzer in Bad Lauchstadt will "give the Leuna refinery access to the future European hydrogen infrastructure and the international markets for green hydrogen."

** France's TotalEnergies said June 2023 it is "actively responding to a call from its aviation customers to increase production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)" and from 2028 will produce 500,000 mt/year of SAF at its sites in France. The volume, which will come from its Grandpuits, Gonfreville and La Mede plants, will be "enough to cover the gradual increase in the European SAF blending mandate, set at 6% for 2030."

Grandpuits will be able to produce 210,000 mt/year of SAF as of 2025 and further 75,000 mt/year by 2027. At the Gonfreville refinery in Normandy the company started coprocessing SAF from used cooking oil. It plans to increase annual production to 40,000 mt from 2025. It will also produce additional 150,000 mt/year by coprocessing HVO biodiesel produced at La Mede.

Biodiesel produced at the biorefinery La Mede is already used at the Oudalle plant near Le Havre to make SAF.

Meanwhile TotalEnergies is studying a new investment to have the capacity to process by 2024 at La Mede 100% waste from circular economy, such as used cooking oil and animal fat to produce biofuels and SAF by coprocessing.

La Mede stopped processing crude oil at the end of 2016 and was converted into a bio plant in 2019.

** Finland's Neste said in June 2023 it is ramping up production at its recently expanded Singapore renewables facility and expects to reach its design capacity in the coming months. The Singapore expansion, which started up in the second half of April, will bring the full design capacity of the site to 2.6 million mt/year, including up to 1 million mt/year SAF.

Its joint venture with Marathon Petroleum for renewable diesel production at Martinez, California, which started up its first phase in February, is moving towards the second phase, which will bring a wider pool of feedstocks, Neste officials said during a Capital Markets Day June 20.

The plant will reach full capacity as the third phase is ramped up towards the end of 2023 and early 2024.

It has previously said Martinez' nameplate capacity is 2.1 million mt/year.

Neste has also decided to expand the Rotterdam facility and the construction is "well underway."

The expansion is set to add 1.3 million mt/year to a total of 2.7 million mt/year.

By increasing its SAF capabilities it expects to produce up to 1.5 million mt/year of SAF in 2024, which will reach 2.2 million mt/year by the end of 2026.

Neste's production capacity for renewable products is set to increase to 5.5 million mt/year at the beginning of 2024 due to the expansion at Singapore and the Martinez joint venture.

When completed, the Rotterdam expansion project will further increase the total capacity to 6.8 million mt/year by the end of 2026.

** Finland's Neste has made the final investment decision to build upgrading facilities for liquefied plastic waste at its Porvoo refinery, it said June 2023. The facility will have a capacity to upgrade 150,000 mt/year of liquefied plastic waste which can then be used as high-quality feedstock for new plastics. It is due to be finalized in the first half of 2025.

"We have developed our capability to process circular raw material at the Porvoo refinery over the recent years and are now set to build a respective facility," said Markku Korvenranta, Executive Vice President in Neste's Oil Products.

Neste started processing liquefied waste plastic at Porvoo in 2020 as trial runs. The company has said it aims to process more than 1 million mt/year of plastic waste from 2030.

Neste aims to make its Porvoo refinery the most sustainable in Europe by 2030 and possibly end crude refining by the mid-2030s. The transformation of the Porvoo refinery would start with coprocessing of renewable and circular feedstock and could continue with the retrofit of existing units at a later stage.

Neste is also developing a lignocellulosics project which aims to convert "forestry-based waste and residue raw materials into advanced biofuels" at Porvoo.

Separately, Neste said it has decided to "proceed to the basic engineering phase" of a 120 MW electrolyzer project at Porvoo aimed to produce green hydrogen. If an investment decision is made in 2024, production could start in 2026. The green hydrogen would be used primarily in Porvoo to replace hydrogen produced from fossil fuel and will support the company's goal "to transform the Porvoo refinery to the most sustainable refinery in Europe by 2030," it said.

** Galp's Sines refinery has received a favorable environmental impact assessment from Portugal's Environment Agency (APA) for its proposed 100 MW green hydrogen electrolyzer and associated storage. The unit will be able to produce up to 14,000 mt/year of hydrogen, according to the specifications.

Construction was expected to take two years at a cost of Eur217 million. The company said in May it expected to take a final investment decision on the unit during 2023.

The hydrogen would be used principally for internal refinery use, but Galp's plans include a potential expansion to 600 MW, which it would integrate into a wider hydrogen project for the region, GreenH2Atlantic, which includes a separate 100 MW electrolyzer together with EDP as part of a conversion of the nearby halted coal plant.

Portugal's Galp has also said it expects to sanction key projects in 2023, including 270,000 mt/year production of HVO capacity for producing advanced biodiesel and SAF, with a final investment decision expected in the year. Galp said that the Sines industrial site around the refinery will undergo a gradual transformation into a green energy hub.

** Cepsa has signed a partnership agreement to incorporate Norway's Yara Clean Ammonia in the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley in southern Spain. The company will be involved with a new green ammonia plant at San Roque, where it plans to invest Eur1 billion. The plant will be the largest in Europe, Cepsa said, with production capacity of 750,000 mt/year, which will prevent 3 million mt/year of CO2 emissions.

Under the agreement, Yara Clean Ammonia will supply Cepsa with green ammonia, allowing Cepsa to establish a green hydrogen corridor and serve industrial and maritime customers in Rotterdam and Central Europe. Cepsa has already signed a deal with Netherlands' Gasunie to gain access to its hydrogen network connecting Rotterdam to industrial clusters in Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.

The partnership is the first that Cepsa has announced for San Roque, where it has announced a target of reaching 1 GW of electrolyzer capacity by 2028.

** BP's Castellon and Cepsa's Huelva refineries have been awarded around Eur15 million apiece from Spanish energy transition funds to build hydrogen electrolyzers. The project at Castellon is a 25 MW electrolyzer (named gH2 project), which will be developed together with Spain's Iberdrola at a total cost of around Eur43 million. BP previously said it plans to have 60 MW of electrolyzer capacity in operation at the site by 2025, 200 MW by 2027 and 2 GW by 2030.

BP also plans Castellon's production of biofuels triple to 650,000 mt/year by 2030 with the green hydrogen used as a feedstock in biofuel production, specifically of SAF. The refinery also has a target to triple sustainable jet fuel output to 15,000 b/d as part of its overall decarbonization program.

The project at Huelva is for 52.5 MW of electrolysis capacity in a project costing Eur59 million. During Q1 Cepsa announced agreements with fertilizer group Fertiberia and domestic gas and renewable groups Enagas and Alter Enersun to reach 400 MW of hydrogen capacity at Huelva by 2026. The company is seeking more partners to reach a target of 1 GW of capacity by 2030 under its Andalusia Hydrogen Valley project.

The company is expected to start work soon on a new Eur100-million dock at Huelva for its export operations of biofuels from 2026 and green hydrogen from 2027.

Cepsa said March 2023 it will build a new unit to produce second generation biofuel at the Huelva refinery with an investment of Eur1 billion. The plant will produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. The biofuels will be produced from organic waste, including used cooking oil and agricultural residues.

The plant will contribute to Cepsa's strategy to reach 2.5 million mt/year of biofuel production by 2030, making it a leader in the Iberian peninsula. The total will include 800,000 mt/year of SAF.

** Operator Petronor said May 2023 that owner Repsol and Saudi Aramco have taken a final investment decision to construct a synthetic biofuel plant at Bilbao that will be completed in 2025. The project was previously targeted for 2024.

The companies will invest Eur103 million between them to produce the fuel, which can be used in any combustion engine for road, air and sea vehicles.

The plant will be the first at industrial scale to use CO2 and green hydrogen as feedstock to output 2,100 mt/year of fuel, equal to 18,000 barrels. The project includes a 10 MW electrolyzer, which will have Enagas and Ente Vasco de Energia as partners. Bilbao has been approved as a recipient of EU funding for a planned 100 MW of hydrogen electrolyzer capacity. The refinery is due to conclude the first phase in 2023 with 2.5 MW before scaling it up to 100 MW by 2025.

** Greece's Helleniq Energy said in May 2023 that the pilot investment in "green" hydrogen at the Elefsis refinery "edges closer to the final investment decision," while projects for the production of biofuels, such as HVO and SAF at its refineries, are "in the implementation phase."

** OMV Petrom said May 2023 that it has signed a financing contract through the National Plan for Recovery and Resilience for the production of green hydrogen at the Petrobrazi refinery in Romania. The project involves putting into operation a capacity of 20 MW for production of hydrogen by water electrolysis, which will be powered by renewable energy. It is estimated to produce over 2,600 mt/year. The final investment decision is due to be made in 2024 with completion expected for 2025.

** Germany's Schwedt refinery will halt fossil fuel processing and be transformed into a "hydrogen hub" producing synthetic and biofuels and other products by 2045, the refinery's management said at a press conference, according to local media reports. The refinery, which can currently produce around 11 million mt/year of oil products, would be able to make about 1 million mt/year of synthetic aviation fuels, 1 million mt/year of methanol and high-value chemical products, and 1 million mt/year of biodiesel, ethanol and biomethane, according to the reports. In order to produce synthetic hydrocarbons, the refinery will need 800,000 mt/year of green hydrogen from 2045. By 2027 it is expected to have electrolyzer capacity of 400 MW which would be able to produce 30,000 mt/year of hydrogen, with production reaching 160,000 mt/year in 2030 and increasing further to 240,000 mt/year, renewable energy services provider Enertrag, which is working on the feasibility study for the plant's transformation together with the refinery's management, said in a statement May 9.

** Repsol said it was retrofitting the hydro units in all five Spanish refineries it operates to increase its use of bio feedstock as the business was starting to give positive impetus to its refining margins. Mild hydrocracker units at A Coruna, Bilbao and Puertollano as well as hydrocrackers at Cartagena and Tarragona will all be modified with no real capex impact, CEO Josu Jon Imaz said.

** The European Commission has approved a Eur158 million Polish green hydrogen support package for Poland's Gdansk refinery under state aid rules, it said in April 2023. PKN Orlen via its LOTOS Green H2 subsidiary plans a 100 MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen used in refinery processes as well as a 50 MW solar power plant and 20 MWh battery storage, it said. The electrolyzer is expected to start operating in 2027 and gradually increase production to 13,600 mt/year.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a hydrotreated vegetable oils installation at Plock. PKN Orlen had approved a Zloty 600 million investment to build a HVO unit to produce biofuels at its Plock refinery. The unit will process used rapeseed oil to produce an additive to diesel or aviation fuel. The annual production of the unit will be 300,000 mt of biodiesel or aviation biofuel. The start of production is scheduled for mid-2024.

** Poland's PKN said its 2022 investments included the construction of a bioethanol unit at the company's small Polish biofuels plant, Orlen Poludnie. PKN Orlen is also constructing a hydrogen plant at its Poludnie biorefinery in Trzebinia. Annual production will be 16 million cu m, and three-quarters of that will be used to produce glycol. The remainder will be used to produce 45 kg/h of fuel-grade hydrogen for use in transport.

** PKN Orlen said its subsidiary Orlen Poludnie has signed an agreement to build a "complex of units for production of II generation bioethanol" at its biofuel refinery in Jedlicze, southern Poland. The B2G complex will include a main unit for bioethanol production and will have the capacity to produce 25,000 mt/year of bioethanol from biomass. In the next stage, a biogas plant will be built. The biomass will be mainly cereals straw sourced from Polish farmers. The bioethanol complex will also include a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant, which will generate heat for bioethanol production. The Jedlicze refinery is a small former petroleum refinery, which together with the Trzebinia refinery, was incorporated into Orlen Poludnie, the company's biofuels subsidiary.

** Gunvor Group said that as part of its Rotterdam refinery starting a "journey to a sustainable future" it has been renamed from Gunvor Petroleum Rotterdam to Gunvor Energy Rotterdam, "a name that is more inclusive of the increasing number of energy transition projects that are underway." The new programs underway at the site include "plastics recycling and a proposed green hydrogen import terminal", it said adding that more projects are being planned. Gunvor had already closed the two crude processing units at the refinery, one in 2019 and the other in 2020, saying that it was developing new processes around hydrogen and co-processing of vegetable oil.

In Oct. 2021, Gunvor said it had agreed to partner with petrochemical group Dow to purify pyrolysis oil feedstocks derived from plastic waste, using an existing unit at its refinery site in Rotterdam. The venture will purify pyrolysis oil feedstock derived from plastic waste that are of sufficient quality to produce new polymers. Under the deal, Gunvor will supply cracker-ready feedstock to Dow in Europe, which will be used to produce circular plastics for customers.

** Phillips 66 is looking at carbon capture and storage as well as electrolytic green hydrogen production to decarbonize operations at its Humber refinery in the UK, Commercial Manager for Emerging Energy Mike Wailes said Feb. 2023. The initial focus is on post-combustion capture from the refining process, including from the crude topping unit, fluid catalytic cracker and hydro-desulfurization unit, with further more expensive options coming from refueling to use hydrogen, he said.

Phillips 66 is developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to be powered by offshore wind which can be scalable to 300 MW.

The Humber refinery completed its first delivery of SAF under a supply agreement with British Airways in early 2022.

Phillips 66 has said previously its UK refinery was moving to produce 5,000 b/d renewable diesel by 2024 after expanding capacity to 3,000 b/d from 1,000 b/d. Humber produced 1,000 b/d of renewable diesel in 2020, after starting production in 2019.

** Spain's Repsol is to build a new 25,000 mt/year production line for recycled polyethylene at its Puertollano site. The new line, which will produce high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) with a recycled plastic content of 10%-80%, was expected to come into operation by the end of 2024. Current capacity for the plastics production at the site is 16,000 mt/year. Puertollano is also due to start a first polyurethane foam recovery plant this year at Puertollano while it also has plans to build a new unit to produce 15,000 mt/year of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) to come online in 2024 with an investment of Eur105 million.

** Renewable hydrogen company Everfuel has signed an agreement in Jan. 2023 to supply oxygen to an undisclosed company from its HySynergy electrolyzer in Fredericia, Denmark, enabling a higher utilization of the plant. The conditional agreement will improve the overall utilization and efficiency of the second phase of the electrolyzer, providing a long-term revenue stream, Everfuel said. HySynergy 2.0 will extend the existing 20 MW electrolyzer with 300 MW of additional capacity by 2025. It will be developed with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia and will produce hydrogen to decarbonize industrial processes and transportation. The first 20-MW phase started hydrogen production in December, with first commercial deliveries due in 2023. The plant, adjacent to the Fredericia oil refinery, will supply renewable hydrogen to the facility and for local zero-emissions transport, Everfuel said. The plant will send 80% of the hydrogen produced to the refinery for use as a feedstock in the refining process. The remaining 20% will go to hydrogen mobility applications. Phase two is to be built in three 100-MW stages.

** OMV said that together with AEG Fuels it will supply SAF from its Schwechat refinery on-demand for the "general aviation segment" to be used as an alternative to conventional jet fuel at the Vienna International Airport. SAF is produced at Schwechat by co-processing Austrian used cooking oil and is supplied via a direct pipeline connection to Vienna's international airport. OMV had also supplied the first batch of SAF to Vienna International Airport for fueling Austrian Airlines aircraft. Schwechat has received the two main components for producing SAF -- the reactor and column. From mid-2023 up to 160,000 mt of liquid biomass will be converted into SAF using an innovative co-processing method, it said. "The new reactor will process substances including vegetable oil together with other feedstocks in a procedure known as co-processing. This innovative process involves refining the biogenic feedstock via a hydrogenation process using hydrogen," OMV said. In the future, the process can be used for processing other feedstock such as used cooking oil or advanced biofuels. OMV plans to increase its SAF sales to more than 700,000 mt/year by 2030. Separately, OMV will build the country's largest electrolysis plant at the Schwechat refinery through a joint investment with Kommunalkredit Austria AG. The plant is expected to start in H2 2023. The 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis will produce up to 1,500 mt/year of green hydrogen.

** Germany's Bayernoil is looking at producing SAF from sewage sludge. It could convert 100,000 mt of sewage sludge into SAF annually under Project Bayosine. The processing, which involves pyrolisis, can be done in a new unit at the Vohburg site of the plant.

** Sweden's Preem aims to expand the HVO capacity at its Gothenburg plant from 320,000 cu m/year to 1.3 million cu m/year in 2026. "This is planned to take place in a completely new facility designed to produce renewable vehicle fuels and aviation fuels with great flexibility," it said. In its Lysekil plant, production of HVO from the Synsat plant "was the highest to date," the company said. Preem is rebuilding the existing Synsat plant, so it can produce renewable raw materials and replace part of the fossil production. It is expected to reach renewable production capacity of 950,000 cu m/year by 2024.

** Finland's UPM expects its Leuna biorefinery in Germany to be operational by the end of 2023 and ramp up in 2024. Construction of the facility, which will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals, started in 2020. Its total annual capacity will be 220,000 mt bio-monoethylene glycol and lignin-based renewable functional fillers. It will also produce monopropylene glycol and industrial sugars made from sustainably harvested beechwood sourced regionally in Germany.

** Greece's Motor Oil Hellas said its Corinth refinery by 2030 aims to enhance its pure hydrogen infrastructure through demonstration and scale-up of green hydrogen. In the long term, it aims to be a "large producer of clean hydrogen".

** Repsol's Cartagena has started construction of its planned second-generation biofuel plant at the nearby to the refinery Escombreras facility, which should result in the production of 250,000 mt/year of biodiesel from waste from mid-2023. The company will invest Eur200 million in the project that would output biodiesel, biojet, bionaphtha and biopropane, allowing an overall CO2 reduction of 900,000 mt/year. As part of its drive to decarbonize the refinery, Repsol also plans to build a 100 MW hydrogen electrolyzer at Cartagena, with a target date of 2025.

** Orsted and BP are to jointly develop a 50 MW renewable hydrogen project at BP's Lingen refinery in Germany. The project, expected to be operational in 2024, would comprise a 50 MW electrolyzer capable of generating 9,000 mt/year of hydrogen, 20% of the refinery's current fossil-based hydrogen consumption. The electrolyzer is expected to be powered by an Orsted North Sea offshore wind farm. The partners have a longer-term ambition to build more than 500 MW of renewable hydrogen capacity at Lingen, providing renewable hydrogen to meet all the refinery's hydrogen demand and provide feedstock for future synthetic fuel production.

** Italian energy company Eni and SEA, the operator of Milan's Malpensa and Linate airports, have signed an agreement to supply SAF for commercial flights, as a step towards accelerating the "ecological transition" of the two airports. Eni plans to develop Eni Biojet which will be made "exclusively" from used cooking oil or animal fats and can be "used in a blend with conventional jet fuel of up to 50%," Umberto Carrara, Director of Green/Traditional Refining and Market at Eni said. The company plans to produce around 200,000 mt/year by 2024 and double the production by 2030.

** BP has partnered with Dutch green hydrogen company HyCC to develop its 250-MW H2-Fifty electrolyzer project in Rotterdam. The companies will next select a technology partner for the previously announced renewable hydrogen project and begin environmental studies, with a final investment decision expected in 2023. The project is expected to come online in 2025. The renewable hydrogen produced at the facility will replace fossil-based feedstock at BP's Rotterdam refinery and other industries in the area. The plant will be situated in the Maasvlakte area of Rotterdam.

** Russia's Lukoil said in December 2021 that it has signed memorandum of intent with Rusatom Overseas, part of the Rosatom Group, to cooperate in the production and supply of green hydrogen for the company's Petrotel refinery in Ploesti, Romania.

** Varo Energy's Cressier refinery in Switzerland will use solar panel generated electricity by 19,000 photovoltaic panels for a "significant portion" of the electricity it consumes. Varo Energy Group and Groupe E will build the "most powerful ground-mounted solar facility in Switzerland" with an installed capacity of 7.7 MW. It will be built in the industrial zone east of the refinery. At full power, the park will be able to supply more than 60% of the refinery's needs.

** ExxonMobil, Macquarie's Green Investment Group, and SGN are studying the potential for a low-carbon hydrogen hub centered around ExxonMobil's Fawley refinery on the UK's south coast. Initial hydrogen production could be around 4.3 TWh/year from 2030. Hydrogen demand in the Southampton industrial cluster around the refinery could reach 37 TWh by 2050.

** Italy's Saras is working on activating a green hydrogen plant for a total of 20 MW. Saras is building the green hydrogen plant with Italian utility Enel. The hydrogen produced would be used at the Sarroch refinery. It is currently provided by the IGCC complex and two reforming units on the industrial site.

** The Refhyne II consortium, developing a 100-MW electrolyzer to produce renewable hydrogen for Shell's Rheinland refinery in Germany at its Wesseling site, has received a Eur32.4 million grant from the EU. The project follows on from the 10-MW Refhyne I at the refinery, Europe's largest proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, which started operations in July 2021, producing up to 1,300 mt/year of renewable hydrogen. The five electrolyzer modules, with a total 10 MW of capacity, have been installed at the Wesseling site. The refinery comprises the Wesseling (south) and Godorf (north) sites. Shell plans to end crude processing at the Wesseling site in 2025. Delivery of the Refhyne II is expected for 2024. Separately, Shell is planning to produce sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel using renewable power and biogenic sources.

** Honeywell said that a trial to co-process biomass-based pyrolysis oil in the Lysekil FCC has been completed producing partially renewable transportation fuel. The refinery used Honeywell UOP's proprietary bioliquid feed system. Swedish refiner Preem announced carrying out the first tests at Lysekil to produce renewable gasoline from sawdust as it has started to process pyrolysis oil at the FCC. Separately, a study by Preem and state-owned utility Vattenfall has shown "very good conditions" for an electrolysis plant at the Lysekil refinery which will produce hydrogen for biofuels. Preem aims to ramp up biofuels production to approximately 5 million cu m/year by 2030, which "requires a large-scale supply of hydrogen, where the expansion of one or more electrolyzers can play an important role." In October 2020, Preem had started a conversion of Lysekil that will make it the biggest producer of renewable fuels in Scandinavia. The company had abandoned an upgrade of the conventional oil refinery.

** TotalEnergies has launched a research project with French waste and water utility Veolia to accelerate the development of advanced biofuels made from microalgae fed by CO2, the companies said. Under the agreement, the companies will set up a four-year research and testing project to grow microalgae at TotalEnergies La Mede biorefinery in southern France, with the long-term goal of producing biofuel. Separately, TotalEnergies and utility Engie have signed a cooperation agreement to design, develop, build and operate France's largest renewable hydrogen production site near Total's La Mede biorefinery. Production could start in 2024. The Masshylia project at Martigues, west of Marseilles, will be powered by a 100-MW solar farm with a 40-MW electrolyzer set to produce 5 mt/day of green hydrogen to meet the needs of the biofuel production process at Total's nearby biorefinery.

** Germany's Heide refinery aims to scale its 30 MW electrolyzer project to 300 MW by end 2025. The 30 MW pilot project is part of the Westkueste 100 consortium with Orsted, while the 300 MW expansion project is part of the HyScale 100 project. A final investment decision of the 30 MW pilot is to be taken with a view to a 2023 start date. Output from the electrolyzers will replace conventional hydrogen generated on-site. Using hydrogen blended with CO2 to make methanol, the Klesch-owned refinery aims to be supplying 5% of the jet fuel used at the nearby Hamburg airport as SAF by 2024.

** In Q1 2021, Polish refiner Grupa Lotos, majority owned by PKN Orlen, launched its Pure H2 project, which includes the construction of a hydrogen purification unit and a system for supplying hydrogen to vehicles that haul compressed hydrogen at Gdansk. The project is scheduled to be completed in Q4 2023. Lotos plans to build a pilot 100 MW electrolysis installation and 20 MW power generation unit by 2025. The first stage of the investment will be a pilot project in 2020-25, including a 100 MW electrolysis installation, a 20 MW power generation unit, hydrogen storage and fuel cells. The company said its location in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea coastline was favorable for cooperation with planned offshore wind farms to produce renewable hydrogen. In the second stage between 2025-30, Lotos would look to expand the capacity of the electrolysis installation to 1 GW, and the associated gas-fired generation unit to 200 MW. Storage capacity would be increased to 2,500 mt of hydrogen. In a third stage to 2040, Lotos aimed to become the regional leader in the production and distribution of green hydrogen with plans to supply the gas to refineries and power generation plants, as well as injecting hydrogen into the gas grid. The electrolysis installation would be expanded to 4 GW with a 1 GW gas-fired generation unit, it said.

** TotalEnergies' Antwerp refinery is interested in adding co-processing biofuel units to the refinery. The company said it was considering adding units to its existing refinery. There is no timeline for deciding about the project. De Standard newspaper cited Jacques Beuckelaers, CEO of Total Antwerp, as saying the units would have capacity of 150,000 mt/year and would process cooking oil and animal fats.

** Germany's MiRo refinery in Karlsruhe is considering launching production of synthetic fuels, pending approval by the local government. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg plans a large renewable fuels pilot project at the MiRo refinery.

LAUNCHES

EXISTING ENTRIES

** Turkey's Ersan Petrol is still hopeful of its plans for a 1.4 million mt/year refinery at Kahramanmaras in southeast Turkey will be able to go ahead despite repeated delays and a difficult investment climate. Project coordinator Cenk Pala said Ersan was in talks with prospective partners and sources of finance for the project and hopes to start work on the FEED study this year. The refinery is planned for a 300,000 sq m site in Kahramanmaras which holds a defunct mini refinery that will be dismantled. A pre-feasibility study by Axens has defined the configuration and capacity of the plant which will produce mainly Euro 5 diesel, Euro 5 gasoline, jet and bitumen.

** A new greenfield Porto Romano refinery in Albania will be oriented to export markets but will also be able to cover Albania's domestic demand, Helmut Mayrhofer, consultant at Larkalis said. Austria-based consultancy Larkalis is leading an international consortium working on the project which will involve building the refinery in the port town of Durres. The refinery has a two-year construction authorization and could be commissioned by end-2025, depending on international developments.

** Azeri state oil company Socar is considering developing a second refinery in Turkey, in addition to its existing 214,000 b/d Star refinery at Aliaga on Turkey's central Aegean coast.

Austria supported[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austria-backs-eu-russia-sanctions-after-ukraine-removes-raiffeisen-blacklist-2023-12-16/] the EU's 12th sanction package against Russia after Ukraine suspended the inclusion of the Raiffeisen Bank in the war sponsors list, Reuters reported on Dec. 16, citing an EU diplomat.

Media reports emerged[https://kyivindependent.com/media-austria-posing-obstacle-to-eus-12th-sanctions-package-against-russia/] ahead of the Dec. 14-15 European Council summit that Vienna is delaying the newest package in an effort to remove the Austrian Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) from Kyiv's blacklist.

Even though EU countries publicly announced[https://kyivindependent.com/eu-agrees-to-12th-sanctions-package-against-russia/] the 12th package during the summit, EUObserver wrote that Austria continues[https://euobserver.com/world/157838] to hold out on account of the RBI.

The website of Ukraine's National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NAZK) now reads[https://sanctions.nazk.gov.ua/en/boycott/] that the inclusion of the RBI in the international sponsors of war list is "suspended for the period of bilateral consultations involving representatives of the European Commission."

"Austria has now lifted its reserve. Sanctions (against Russia) should now be formally adopted this coming week," Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist Rikard Jozwiak reported[https://twitter.com/RikardJozwiak/status/1736097603412971528].

Despite the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the RBI, Austria's second-largest bank lender, has continued to operate in Russia.

The bank has long-standing ties with Russia and is only one of only two foreign banks classified as "systemically important" by the Russian central bank.

Czechia opened[https://kyivindependent.com/czechia-investigates-raiffeisen-bank-due-to-its-russia-activities/] an investigation of the RBI in August over its ongoing business activities in Russia after the Czech Association for the Rights of Citizens and Entrepreneurs highlighted that Raiffeisen's Russia-based companies had paid up to $720 million from their profits to the Russian state budget in taxes.

The European Central Bank (ECB) urged[https://kyivindependent.com/reuters-european-central-bank-pushing-raiffeisen-to-exit-russian-market/] Raiffeisen on March 24 to devise an exit strategy for selling or shutting down the group's Russia branch of operations.

The bank responded to the criticism by saying that it is reducing its business activity in the country, minimizing "the RBI Group's cross-border exposure to Russia," and exploring ways of selling or spinning off its Russian branch, but no further updates have been provided.

Raiffeisen and Deripaska skirt Russia sanctions with €1.5bn deal

Asset swap will hand oligarch cash in exchange for his stake in Austria’s Strabag construction firm

Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank International has concluded a complex asset swap arrangement with Oleg Deripaska that skirts EU sanctions restrictions to hand the Russian oligarch roubles worth €1.5bn.

In a statement on Tuesday, RBI said its Russian subsidiary would make the cash payment to Deripaska in exchange for his 28 per cent shareholding in Austria’s Strabag, one of the largest construction companies in Europe.

Deripaska’s stake in Strabag — held through his company Rasperia — was frozen last year by the EU in response to what the bloc said was his complicity in Russia’s brutal war of aggression in Ukraine.

“In pursuing this transaction, RBI has diligently abided by and will continue to diligently abide by all sanction requirements,” the bank said in a statement.

It noted that closing of the acquisition was subject to conditions including regulatory approval and “satisfactory completion of the sanctions compliance due diligence by RBI”.

Deripaska did not respond to a request for comment.

RBI’s Russian subsidiary will transfer Rasperia’s holding in Strabag to its parent company via a dividend in kind, the bank added. That will require the subsidiary securing special approval from the Kremlin.

RBI has raked in vast profits since Russia’s war in Ukraine began, thanks to its position as the biggest European lender remaining in Russia.

In the first nine months of this year, more than half of the bank’s profits came from its Russian division. The bank is one of the biggest lenders in central and eastern Europe.

Moscow’s increasingly onerous restrictions on foreign businesses operating in its territory have meant that until now all of RBI’s earnings there have been marooned in the country.

RBI has come under mounting pressure to scale back its operations but has insisted it has few viable options for doing so without unnecessarily harming its shareholders.

The bank has previously explored complicated asset swaps with Russian entities under sanctions. The Financial Times reported in March that RBI had begun work on a possible €400mn deal with Sberbank’s frozen European holdings. The deal fell through after the state-owned Russian bank sold its assets to another party.

Deripaska was one of very few oligarchs in Russia to publicly criticise Russia’s war in Ukraine during its early phases — albeit indirectly. As Vladimir Putin’s domestic crackdown on dissent has grown in strength, however, Deripaska has become less vocal.

In an interview with the FT, in September, he said European sanctions against Russia were failing in their goals.

“I always doubted this Wunderwaffe [wonder-weapon], as Germans used to say, of the sanctions — weaponising the financial system as a kind of tool to negotiate,” he said.

The billionaire, who made his money through the aluminium smelter Rusal and energy company EN+, has long had strong business connections in Austria.

A crucial ally in the country is Siegfried “Sigi” Wolf, who served as chair of Deripaska’s engineering conglomerate Russian Machines. Wolf was also a long-serving former board member of Strabag and of the European subsidiary of Sberbank, which was headquartered in Vienna.

Wolf has also been a strong critic of sanctions against Russian businesses by Europe. He wrote a personal letter to Putin in April offering to use his experience as a member of the supervisory board of the Porsche Group to help rebuild Russia’s car industry, if the government would give him a big enough loan.

Miles Johnson talks to law enforcers who dealt a big blow to the super cartel

This is an audio transcript of Hot Money podcast Episode 8: The Red Notebook

Miles Johnson

Previously on Hot Money. The pressure on Daniel Kinahan is rising. His partners in the Dubai super cartel are starting to fall. And police around the world are working on a secret plan to take him down for good. 

It’s the morning of April 12th, 2022 and reporters and TV crews arrive at a press conference in Dublin that’s been called by the Irish police. Officially, there’ll be an update on how law enforcement agencies are working together to collaborate against international organised crime. But it’s a bit vague, perhaps suspiciously vague, and journalists are starting to speculate about what this press conference is really about.

Behind the scenes, John O’Driscoll, is getting nervous. John’s the assistant commissioner in charge of serious organised crime. Ever since his meeting with US officials three years before he’s been working on a single objective. And the press conference this morning in Dublin is going to be the moment he finally gets to announce it to the world. 

But John knows that if word gets out, it could all fall apart. He’s chosen the venue carefully.

John O’Driscoll

I said that beyond any doubt it was not going to take place in those rooms that we may have had press conferences relating to the Kinahans previously.

Miles Johnson

Instead it would take place in Dublin’s city hall. It’s the right sort of setting for a historic announcement, marble floors, huge classical pillars and statues on ancient Roman-style plinths.

John O’Driscoll

The holding of the event in city hall was important, first of all, because it is that wonderful building that it is, but also it is situated in south inner city, Dublin, which is where the Kinahan organisation emerged from.

Miles Johnson

Quietly, senior officials from various foreign police forces have been flying into Dublin. People from the US Treasury, DEA, and Customs and Border Protection. Officials from Europol, and the UK’s national crime agency, including deputy director of investigations, Matt Horne.

Matt Horne

We’d arrived the day before from the UK, and had been extremely well looked after by the Garda from the airport.  And you know, they were keeping a very close eye on us to make sure that all the, all of us representatives of the international law enforcement community were sort of well looked after and well protected.

Miles Johnson

And despite all these high profile police officers arriving in Dublin at exactly the same time, John’s been able to kept things under wraps. Everyone is now seated. The hall falls quiet in anticipation. And John walks out onto the stage. Within minutes the Kinahans will become some of the most wanted men on the planet.

I’m Miles Johnson, and from the Financial Times and Pushkin Industries this is Hot Money: The New Narcos. Episode 8: The Red Notebook.

Back when I started at the FT as a trainee reporter 15 years ago, I never expected I’d end up writing about organised crime. We covered things like the stock market, and mergers and acquisitions. There was this very clear boundary back then between the world we wrote about, the world of business, CEOs, and politicians and the underworld. But something’s changed since then. The line between criminal activity and state backed enterprise, between big business and gangsters, it’s become fuzzier.

We live in a time where some heads of state increasingly act like crime bosses, and the crime bosses, they act like the heads of multinational companies. It could be a world leader investing billions into startups and tech companies, but at the same time ordering the murder of dissidents abroad. It could be North Korean state hackers stealing bitcoins to fund missile programmes, or Kremlin-backed tycoons using mercenary armies to mine for gold in Africa. Or it could be a cocaine cartel, hiding out in Dubai while carrying out contract killings in Europe for a sanctioned regime.

It’s all part of the rise of a new type of criminal boss, one backed by authoritarian governments. I call them state-backed gangsters. And they’re thriving at a time when the world is becoming more fragmented, and more chaotic.

Reporting on the Dubai super cartel, I’ve discovered that European drug traffickers have been taking advantage of the same money laundering channels that Iran uses to evade western sanctions. That seems to be the reason why international criminals have become unlikely bedfellows with a theocratic regime. 

That press conference that John’s arranged, he knows it could be the beginning of the end for the super cartel. But before we get to that, I want to take a little detour.

Because there’s an important question from the start of this series that we still don’t have an answer to. The murder broker was convicted for arranging the assassination of Ali Motamed, the electrician who was on the run from Iran.

But no one has ever been able to find out who in Iran gave the murder broker his orders. And during the reporting of this series, I came across something that might help us get one step closer. It was a case that revealed a tonne of new information about the way that Iran secretly pursues its enemies in Europe, people like Ali Motamed.

And there’s someone I want to talk to because he was directly involved in that case. Someone who has first hand experience of the long history of violence against enemies of the Iranian regime, wherever they are in the world.

Hossein Abedini was born in Iran, but he now lives in London. He’s in his late 50s and he’s quietly spoken, but he’s been fighting for most of his life.

Hossein Abedini

I have been with the resistance over three decades now, nearly four decades. 

Miles Johnson

In the Spring of 1990, Hossein was a young activist. And he was in Turkey. He says he traveled there to try and stop the deportation of Iranian refugees who’d crossed the border illegally. One day In Istanbul, he’s in a car with two colleagues. They’re on the motorway when suddenly something blocks the road ahead. The traffic slows down. Hossein is up front, sitting next to the driver.

Hossein Abedini

And all of a sudden, we heard, you know, the sound of bullets. They riddled our car from the back.

Miles Johnson

Hossein barely has time to take in that someone is shooting at them, when a car smashes into the front of their vehicle. They can’t drive away.

Hossein Abedini

And another car pinned us from behind. It was then which I realized, you know, this was a, this was an assassination or kidnapping.

Miles Johnson

A man jumps out of the vehicle in front, the one that’s just plowed into their car. He’s holding a revolver. 

Hossein Abedini

And it was only, I think, a couple of meters before he reached our car. I tried to do something. There was a briefcase belonging to my female colleague who was sitting the back of the car, so I just took that, opened the door, and went to stop him. 

Miles Johnson

He’s clutching the briefcase like a shield as the man starts shooting.

Hossein Abedini

The first bullet hit my chest, and uh, I didn’t know how many bullets, you know, I received then. And, uh I just, fell down, fell down in the street. 

Miles Johnson

Hossein’s lying on the ground, bleeding and he can see the man walk up to him. He’s preparing to take a final shot. But nothing happens. 

Hossein Abedini

The bullet jammed in the muzzle of the gun. 

Miles Johnson

That’s Hossein’s first lucky break. 

The traffic starts to move again and the assassins take off. Hossein desperately needs to get to the hospital, but the car he was in is smashed up and everyone else on the motorway, they seem to be trying to run away as quickly as they can. 

Hossein Abedini

I remember very vaguely that my colleague threw herself, you know, in front of one of the cars. And, there was a taxi which stopped. And I was put at the back of the taxi. And I, I just got unconscious. The hospital was only three minutes away. If it was farther than that, I wouldn’t make it.

Miles Johnson

Hossein fell into a coma. It would be 50 days before he woke up. He was told that one bullet had passed very close to his heart and another had destroyed his liver. But even at the hospital, he’s not safe. The killers, they come back, and this time they’re posing as his friends

Hossein Abedini

But my true friends arrived and they were told, you know, that there are other people who wanted to come and see me. And then those people escaped from the scene when they realised, you know, there were people, my true friends, you know, were there. 

Miles Johnson

That’s Hossein’s second stroke of luck. 

And there will be a third one as well, when the killers call up, pretending to be the police. They tell the hospital staff that they know Hossein is now conscious, and they want to interview him about what happened.

Hossein Abedini

But the president of Turkey in those days was Turgut Özal and his mother, you know, was in the same hospital. The president wanted to come and visit his mother and they sealed off the whole area, the hospital. And they realised there was another branch of police who wanted to come and see me. And they found out that was a bogus call, it was the Iranian regime who wanted to get rid of me because they didn’t want me to speak. That was very pure luck.

Miles Johnson

That was more than 30 years ago. Hossein tells me that he’s still affected every day by the damage done to his liver in that attack. But he’s one of the rare survivors of an assassination attempt by the Iranian regime. Several of his friends and colleagues have been murdered since then.

Today Hossein is a senior member of Iran’s main foreign opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran or the NCRI. 

Hossein Abedini

So the main objective of the National Council of Resistance of Iran is to establish a democratic and a secular government in Iran.  Its main principle, of course, has been against any dictatorship, whether it’s the former dictatorship of the Shah or the present medieval dictatorship of the mullahs.

Miles Johnson

The NCRI, its an umbrella organisation and one of the largest groups within it is called the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, known by its Farsi initials, MEK.

Now the MEK, it hasn’t always had the west’s approval. It was implicated in several terrorist attacks against Iran, including the 1981 bombing that Tehran claimed was carried out by Ali Motamed, the quiet electrician in the Netherlands. From 1997 to 2012 the MEK was designated as a terror organisation by the US government. But over the past decade it’s refashioned itself. And now it’s a pretty influential opposition voice on Iran. But for all its acceptance by western powers, the NCRI remains a top target of the Iranian regime. 

In June 2018, Hossein and his colleagues are in Paris. They’re holding a huge meeting, a rally called the Free Iran World Summit.

Hossein Abedini

Tens of thousands of Iranians with many non Iranian supporters of the resistance who came from 67 different countries throughout the world.

Miles Johnson

Dozens of foreign politicians are invited as well, and everyone convenes in a vast conference centre. It’s only afterwards that Hossein finds out what very nearly happened.

Hossein Abedini

I think it was on the 1st of July, the next day, I was told by a friend that the Belgian federal police, you know, they had arrested two Iranians who were trying, you know, to bring a bomb.  

Miles Johnson

Belgian police had arrested two Iranians who were on their way to the Paris conference centre with a bomb. It’s another lucky escape for Hossein and hundreds of other people. And as police investigate the failed bomb plot, they’re going to discover something that I believe could shed new light on the murder of Ali Motamed. It’s the most important discovery in decades about how Iran targets its enemies abroad. And this time, the clues aren’t just glimpses, hints, or encrypted messages. They are in a battered red notebook filled with handwritten notes, sitting in the back of a car.

So Hossein and his colleagues, they discover that someone had tried to plant a bomb at the rally in Paris. And at the same time, police in Germany arrest an Iranian man on a highway in Bavaria.

His name is Assadollah Assadi, and officially, he’s the third counsellor of the Iranian embassy in Vienna. He arrived in Europe in 2014. But in reality, he’s a top spy for Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security. It’s Iran’s equivalent of the CIA or MI6. Assadi is running a network of agents across Europe, meeting them in cafes in small medieval towns handing over secret instructions or bundles of cash. And months before the Paris rally he traveled to Tehran, returning to Europe with a sophisticated bomb hidden in his diplomatic luggage.  

The bomb’s made from an explosive known as TATP or “Mother of Satan”.  It’s extremely volatile. 

Assadi carries it on to Luxembourg and hands it over to his agents. And this part of the story, it’s a bit less like a Le Carré novel, because the venue he chooses, it’s a Pizza Hut.

He gives them the bomb, with instructions for planting it at the Paris rally. And the codeword he uses is “playstation”. But what Assadi doesn’t know, is that European intelligence agencies have been watching his every move, and know exactly what he’s been planning. They even disabled the airport security scanner so he could get through. The two agents are arrested as they travel from Brussels to Paris. 

Assadi is pulled over by the police on a motorway in Germany. And in the back of his car, they find the battered red notebook filled with handwritten notes. Notes that reveal that Assadi was involved in way more than one bomb plot.

Assadi has listed hundreds of different meetings with agents across Europe. He’s itemised cash payments he’s made to spies, and he’s listed more than 200 places he’s visited as part of his work in 11 different countries. Because Assadi, according to the findings of a Belgian criminal court, is part of a secret unit of Iranian foreign intelligence, a sort of murder squad in Europe. It’s called Department 312. And its role is to kill opponents of the regime abroad.

There’s not much public information about Department 312. But what we do know, its pretty terrifying. It’s thought to be a top secret unit that specialises in spying on human rights activists, journalists and others who the Iranian regime believe to be a threat. 

But was Ali Motamed one of their targets?

We know that Assadi arrived in his new job in June 2014. A little over a year before Ali Motamed was killed outside his house in Almere. It was the first successful targeted assassination carried out by Iran in western Europe in over 23 years. And then two years later, in 2017, while Assadi was still free, another Iranian opposition member was gunned down in the Netherlands. So we can say that Assadi arrives in Vienna in late 2014 and then suddenly Iran is linked to several assassinations in Europe.

This isn’t conclusive evidence. But according to the Belgian criminal court documents, targeting dissidents, that was Assadi’s job. So it makes sense that he would at least be a suspect in the Motamed murder.

And we also know that Assadi, he was reporting into really top people in Iran, including the deputy minister of intelligence. After his arrest for the bomb plot, Assadi is put on trial in Belgium, and he gets prison visits from some of Iran’s most senior spies, and other officials from its foreign ministry. They clearly cared a lot about this case. 

The criminal case against Assadi was brought by the Belgian government, but there were also 25 others who joined as private plaintiffs. They were all at that Paris rally and Hossein was one of them, and it gave him access to all the prosecution’s evidence. He sent me the files.

This is hundreds of pages of documents, in several European languages and there’s also extracts from Assadi’s red notebook. And there’s something else, something that I think could be important. Assadi’s job meant that he had to travel a lot on work trips across Europe to meet with his various agents. And it turns out that even spies use Booking.com, the huge online travel agent, to book their hotels or at least Assadi did. And the details of all of those bookings, they’re in the files.

So I am sat here, in the offices of the Financial Times, looking at these records every hotel Assadi stayed in over his four years operating in Europe.

For some of the bookings, he used his official Iranian foreign ministry email address. For others it was burner accounts from Yahoo and Gmail. He seems to have met his agents in some pretty low-key locations. And he often seemed to book two hotels in different places for the same night, maybe thinking it would throw off anyone who was following him. And the records, they do show that he traveled to the Netherlands. On the 6th of September 2016, less than a year after Motamed was murdered, he stayed at the Best Western in The Hague for one night. 

The next evening Assadi booked two hotel rooms, one in the Dutch town of Meppel, and another in Zwartsluis, both really small towns. And in April 2017, Assadi booked a room at the Savoy Amsterdam for one of his agents. So we know he was working in the Netherlands at around the same time that Ali Motamed was murdered. It’s far from a smoking gun, but it’s enough, enough for me to ask Hossein, does he think that Assadi could have been connected to the murder of Mohamed Reza Kolahi, also known as Ali Motamed? I lay out what we know.

So he arrives, Asadi arrives in Austria in 2014. And then in 2015 a man called Mohamed Reza Kalahi, who was living in a town Almere, was shot and killed outside his house.

The murder has never been solved. They know who shot him. They know who told those people to shoot him. The Dutch government then said, we believe the Iranian regime was behind this murder and they expelled two diplomats. But there’s never been any, any further information about who could have co-ordinated a plot like that.

Do you think it’s reasonable to assume that Assadi could have been behind something like that?

Hossein Abedini

Well I don’t have precise information about this case, but I think it makes sense to believe that, of course, I mean, when Assadi was the, you know, the head of this intelligence section in mainly the western Europe, I think that is, this could very well be, I mean, Assadi could very well be behind that.

Miles Johnson

So its reasonable to assume you know, that we have a spy working under diplomatic cover who is in charge of all of western Europe and his focus is effectively organising assassination attempts against opposition figures. So it’s a reasonable assumption, to think that, of the assassinations, or attempted assassinations that occurred in western Europe after 2014, he presumably would have had to have some, had a hand in it?

Hossein Abedini

He’s had a hand in it. Absolutely. 

Miles Johnson

What Hossein says of course it doesn’t prove anything. But at the very least, Assadi has to be considered a suspect. There is this new wave of assassinations in Europe, all connected to the Iranian state, and they begin just after Assadi is posted to Vienna in 2014. 

And the first, it’s the murder of an electrician in a small Dutch town a year later. Assadi’s convicted for the attempted bombing in Paris and he’s sentenced to 20 years for attempted murder and plotting a terrorist attack. Iran denies any involvement. But we’ll never know if he was involved in Ali Motamed’s death. Because after Assadi’s convicted, a Belgian aid worker is arrested in Iran on these trumped up charges of espionage and sentenced to 40 years in prison and 74 lashes.

Then, in May 2023, the Belgian government agreed to exchange Assadi for the aid worker. So Assadi, he’s now back in Iran. And, his notebook aside, he’s taken his secrets with him.

It’s the 12th of April 2022 and we’re back in Dublin’s City Hall. The entire time John O’Driscoll has been working on a plan to sanction the Kinahans, he’s been worried about it leaking. Because he knows that if the news gets out, they’ll quickly be able to hide their assets before they are frozen.

[VOICE CLIP OF DREW HARRIS]

Today is a landmark day in the fight against organised crime

Miles Johnson

But now the Kinahans have run out of time. 

[VOICE CLIP OF DREW HARRIS]

And in particular against the Kinahan organised crime gang. 

Miles Johnson

John’s boss Drew Harris, commissioner of the Irish police, steps up to the podium. 

[VOICE CLIP OF DREW HARRIS]

This organised crime gang started life as a south inner city Dublin drug dealers but has grown over the decades to become a transnational crime cartel . . . that is estimated to have generated over €1bn for them.

Miles Johnson

Then a senior official from the US Treasury announces the news that will make headlines around the world. 

[VOICE CLIP OF GREG GATJANIS]

So as of today, the Kinahan Transnational Criminal Organisation joins the ranks of Italy’s Camorra, Mexico’s Los Zetas, Japan’s Yakuza and Russia’s Thieves in Law. Also as of today as a result of these sanctions these individuals are immediately severed from the US financial system and any assets, property under US jurisdiction are immediately blocked at this moment.   

Miles Johnson

We have to stop here for a minute just to take this all in. It’s utterly remarkable. A criminal family that began in a Dublin flat in the 1980s, is now being compared to the Yakuza and Camorra crime groups whose origins date back hundreds of years. They’ve been sanctioned by the US government, one of a handful of organised crime groups to ever face that kind of penalty.  And the US also puts a $5mn bounty on the heads of Christy, Daniel and his brother Christopher Junior, calling their organisation “a threat to the entire licit economy through its role in international money laundering”. 

Detective Chief Superintendent Seamus Boland, he knows that the US sanctions will destroy the Kinahans’ chance of continuing their life of luxury in Dubai.

Seamus Boland

Because the dangers with sanctions is that if any legitimate business engages with somebody who’s on a sanctions list, they’re actually the people who are committing the criminal offenses and they risk all their assets being seized and they risk being prosecuted. So you know, avenues to live the high life that you would’ve had before are closed down very, very quickly.

You know, people end up with so much money from cocaine trafficking. Behind all this, it’s all about greed. You have money to try and live in your big house, drive your fancy car. Fly business class all across the world. Stay in the best hotels. What the sanctions actually does is it removes a lot of the facilitation that would be possible for people to live their lives and to benefit from the illicit wealth that they’ve actually achieved. 

Miles Johnson

Soon, the United Arab Emirates freeze Daniel’s assets too, and they impose their own sanctions on the Kinahans in Dubai, removing one of the last places on earth they can hide. The Kinahans, they go on the run.

Seamus Boland

Significant parties within the Kinahan organised crime group all went to ground, and have been attempting to evade justice, and hide in the shadows since that date. But from our own information and intelligence and, and conversations with other criminals as well. You know, I think this, this took it to, to a different level because the criminal underworld in Europe didn’t anticipate that sanctions was something that would happen on this side of the Atlantic.

Miles Johnson

But the strange thing is, it’s been more than a year since that big announcement in Dublin, and the Kinahans, they’re all still at large. It’s not clear where they are. 

I’ve heard multiple rumors. Some think that they are still in the UAE, living under false identities. Others think they are somewhere else in the Middle East, laying low. I’ve even heard speculation that they’re building connections with Putin’s Russia.  

So I asked Seamus, why haven’t the police been able to bring them in yet?

Seamus Boland

Well, investigations are still ongoing as well at the moment. So the sanctions was only one phase of a much wider investigation that’s continuously ongoing and, and taking place. And as was announced in, in April 2022 at the designation as well, you know, extradition warrants were, were in place for one of the principals, who’s sought for, for charges in relation to murder and, and directing organized crime. And that’s still outstanding as well. But you can rest assured that investigations are continuing actively across many different jurisdictions. 

Miles Johnson

For a few years, the men who gathered at Daniel Kinahan’s wedding in 2017 seemed almost invincible. They created a new model, stateless gangsters, using modern technology to run global mafias in ways that were impossible a few decades before. 

But eventually, their reputation caught up with them. They made the mistake of becoming too public, too brazen. I began reporting on this story because I think it tells us something important about how the world is changing. And the global shifts that made the Dubai super cartel possible, they’re only accelerating. 

The criminals of the future, I think they’re going to be more global, more sophisticated and more dangerous. And I think it’s going to get harder to tell if someone is a gangster, a businessman, or both.

The story of the super cartel, for me, it’s an ominous sign of these new, hybrid threats that democracies face, and of governments’ weakening ability to fight them. The sanctions against the Kinahans, they’ve been hailed as a victory, a landmark in co-ordinated action by western governments to take down a major crime group. But there’s something I’ve kept asking myself, were the sanctions a show of strength, or really just a sign of weakness?

Some of the world’s most powerful governments have teamed up to go after the Kinahans, but a year later, they are still out there. So the Dubai super cartel may be finished, but its model will live on. And perhaps, something new, and maybe worse, will take its place. In fact, somewhere out there, it probably already has. 

Not long before the sanctions were announced, Rafaelle Imperiale, the Van Gogh boss, was arrested in Dubai and sent to Italy. He’s since agreed to become a state’s witness. And in November 2023 he told Italian prosecutors he would sell off his $80mn private island in Dubai, in the hope of his sentence being reduced.

MTK, the boxing company that Daniel Kinahan co-founded, it closes. And back in the Netherlands, where we began our story, Paul Vugts, the crime reporter, has been able to come out of police protection and return to his normal life. 

Paul Vugts

We wanted our life back in full. So not riding an armored car, but riding a bike and sitting on a terrace.

Miles Johnson

Ulysse Ellian, the local councilor in Almere who campaigned about the Ali Motamed murder, well he’s now a national politician. In 2021 he was elected to the Dutch parliament.

Ulysse Ellian

Look, you know, I was like this baby when I got here, my father had like $20 in his pocket. The honor of representing the Dutch people, it’s massive for me. My goal in life is defending democracy, defending freedom. And that relates to the story of my dad and also this story, look how dangerous the world around us can be.  

Miles Johnson

And the Kinahans, they have to live every day knowing they are being hunted by police. For Michael O’Sullivan, the man who first arrested Christy Kinahan in a Dublin flat back in the 1980s, it’s only a matter of time.

Michael O’Sullivan

You feel like saying to them, did you not think this day would come by doing what you’re doing? Better people than them have been caught. And they have made themselves a global target. And with the DEA on your case, the world is a small place and it gets smaller.

Austria is said to sanction blackmail to keep Raiffeisen in Russia

Austria is seeking to remove Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) from a Ukrainian blacklist of sponsors of the full-scale military invasion of Ukraine in return for supporting the latest EU sanctions on Russia, Reuters reports citing unnamed sources.

Reportedly, Austria and RBI are pushing for the bank to be taken off a Ukrainian list dubbed "international sponsors of war" – which puts pressure on companies to stop doing business in Russia and indirectly supporting the war effort by paying taxes and otherwise contributing to the aggressor’s economy.

As covered in detail by bne IntelliNews, RBI came under heavy regulatory pressure to come up with an exit plan from Russia, the country where it made 60% of its net profit last year.

Earlier in October, Austria's foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, openly criticised that blacklist as arbitrary at a meeting of European ministers in Kyiv, one of the unnamed sources told Reuters. Raiffeisen is the only Austrian company on the list.

Reportedly RBI envoys also met representatives of Ukraine's National Agency of Corruption Prevention, which drew up the list, to discuss how to get the group off it, the sources said. Notably, such tactics have apparently helped to remove Hungary's OTP Bank from the list.

RBI has scaled down its Russian business and is reportedly considering the sale of the business as a whole, or the splitting off of the Russian business into a separate entity, as well as a controversial swap of its loans for those of Russia’s Sberbank that are trapped in Europe by sanctions.

But most recent reports suggested that in reality RBI is delaying plans to leave Russia, hoping that the full-scale military invasion of Ukraine will end before the bank will have to cave in to sanctions pressure and scrap its presence in the country.

“Russian authorities made it clear to RBI that they wish it to stay because it enables international payments,” sources told Reuters back in July.

Austrian campaigners target secret Abramovich villa

Russia sanctions

In Austria's picturesque Salzkammergut, a scandal has erupted over a luxury villa secretly bought by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and why official documents relating to the transaction might have been shredded. Nearly two years into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the affair is shining an unflattering light on how Austria became a playground for Kremlinconnected billionaires, some of Vladimir Putin's most loyal lieutenants, taking advantage of poor oversight and offshore structures to secretly acquire palatial properties across the country.

With sweeping EU sanctions now in force against many of the Russians, a handful of opposition Austrian politicians and campaigners are trying to expose, and in some cases oust, their unwanted guests.

In November, details of the purchase in 2007 of the Fisherman's House on the Fuschlsee, an emerald alpine lake just east of Salzburg, came to light in a leak of offshore documents from Cyprus.

They showed that the property's buyer, a British woman whom locals believed to be an investment banker, was in fact a proxy for Abramovich.

Abramovich was placed under sanction by the EU in March 2022 for his "long and close ties" to the Russian president. The measures mean his assets across the bloc have been frozen.

The Fisherman's House, however, is owned by his daughter Anna, who is not subject to sanctions and was "gifted" the villa in 2017. The property's modest name belies its value. It was bought in a rundown state for €11mn 16 years ago and millions have since been spent on the buildings, which date back to 1637.

Now the local Green party is campaigning to have the Fisherman's House taken back and believes it can do so using the technicalities of local property law. Green MPs allege that laws regulating property sales to non-EU citizens, which demand disclosure of ownership and usage, were circumvented when the house was acquired. They say the sale should be voided.

They have just one problem: the official documents from 2007, which detail what was said about the property's owners, have been destroyed.

"The paper[s] may have been accidentally thrown away when the department moved," said Martin Zauner, a far-right politician who is a member of the Salzburg regional coalition government and is responsible for property matters, to the astonishment of parliamentarians last month.

Legal experts and opposition politicians have questioned the discrepancy and highlighted "mysterious" inconsistencies in the regional government's explanations. "The coincidence [of the files disappearing] has crooked optics," Lukas Hock, a lawyer told Der Standard newspaper.

"We now know that the British woman who bought the house had never really been buying it for herself. She was lent the money by Abramovich's trusts and she was only ever acting as his agent," said Simon Heilig-Hofbauer., a local Green MP.

But, he added, to take back the property they needed to prove that misstatements were made on the record at the time. "That's where the problem begins. My wish would be that the whole sale of this property can be unwound."

Abramovich's representatives did not respond to a request for comment.

The Fisherman's House was not even the most opulent property locally connected to Russian oligarchs under sanction, Heilig-Hofbauer said.

On the Attersee, 10km east, is the Waldschlössl, a pocket palace that belongs to Igor Shuvalov, Russia's former first deputy prime minister.

Technically, the Attersee property is owned by a Liechtenstein trust, which exploits a quirk of Austrian law. But its ties to the Kremlin are clear.

"Even Putin used to come and visit it," said Heilig-Hofbauer.

A Teodor Currentzis concert at the Wiener Festwochen was canceled after the Ukrainian conductor Oksana Lyniv, also on the program, raised concerns about his ties to Russia.

When the Wiener Festwochen, a prestigious festival that brings leading international artists to Vienna, announced this spring’s lineup, the backlash was swift and fierce.

The festival had planned to make the Russian invasion of Ukraine a focus of its programming, juxtaposing an appearance by the Ukrainian conductor Oksana Lyniv with a concert by the maestro Teodor Currentzis[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/arts/music/teodor-currentzis-shed-verdi-requiem.html], who has faced scrutiny over his connections to Russia[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/arts/music/teodor-currentzis-musicaeterna.html]. Critics, including Lyniv, had argued that the pairing was insensitive and ignored the suffering of Ukrainians.

Now, after weeks of pressure, the festival has abandoned its plan, saying that it would cancel[https://www.festwochen.at/en/presseaussendung-12-februar] the appearance by Currentzis while moving forward with the one by Lyniv.

“The decision was clear and there was no alternative,” Milo Rau, the festival’s artistic director, said in an interview on Tuesday. “This was the best solution from bad ones.”

Since Russia invaded Ukraine, many cultural organizations have severed ties with close associates of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the government there. Some institutions have been criticized for overreach after canceling performances by Russian artists with no known connections to the government. Others have grappled with how to handle artists who had less clear-cut allegiances.

Currentzis, a Greek-born, Russian-trained maestro whose leadership of the Russian ensemble MusicAeterna turned him into one of the world’s most prominent conductors, has been at the center of the discussion because of his relationship with VTB Bank, a Russian state-owned institution that has been under sanction[https://www.nytimes.com/article/russia-us-ukraine-sanctions.html]s by the United States and other countries. VTB Bank was the main sponsor of MusicAeterna. Currentzis has also drawn scrutiny for his association with Russian officials: In 2014, Putin awarded Currentzis citizenship by presidential decree.

Currentzis has refrained from publicly commenting on the war. But as criticism has mounted, he announced[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/01/arts/music/teodor-currentzis-utopia-musicaeterna.html] in 2022 that he would form a new international ensemble, Utopia, with the support of donors outside Russia. He continues to conduct in Russia, according to MusicAeterna’s website[https://musicaeterna.org/participant/teodor-currentzis/].

His appearance in Vienna was to be part of a tour in June with the SWR Symphony Orchestra of Germany, which he leads as chief conductor[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/arts/music/teodor-currentzis-swr-orchestra.html], performing Benjamin Britten’s “War Requiem.” He was to appear with the Vienna Boys’ Choir and the London Symphony Chorus.

Representatives for Currentzis did not respond to requests for comment. Anke Mai, the SWR program director, said in a statement that she regretted the Wiener Festwochen’s decision to cancel the performance. She said the orchestra had never asked Currentzis to make a statement on the war “in view of the consequences that such a statement would have for Currentzis in Russia.” She added that she believed Currentzis and the orchestra were “sending a message that cannot be misunderstood” by choosing to perform the “War Requiem,” which is a call for peace.

“All those involved would have liked to bring this message to Vienna,” Mai said. “Nevertheless, we accept the decision of the Wiener Festwochen and hope to meet again in more peaceful times.”

Rau, the festival’s artistic director, who has a reputation as a provocative stage director[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/theater/milo-rau-ntgent-controversy.html], said he had invited Currentzis to perform[https://www.festwochen.at/en/war-requiem] in part because he was interested in the idea of starting a conversation about art in wartime. Lyniv was also invited to lead the Kyiv Symphony Orchestra and the National Choir of Ukraine in a performance[https://www.festwochen.at/en/kaddish-requiem] of the Ukrainian composer Yevhen Stankovych’s oratorio “Kaddish Requiem,” written to remember the 1941 massacre of Jews near Kyiv by Nazis[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/movies/babi-yar-context-review.html].

Rau said he was troubled by Currentzis’s ties to Russian institutions. But he said he felt he had created a context in which he could appear.

“We decided this would be a nice thing to try to have this exchange,” he said. “It was very intentional to say that we want to have something that is difficult and that is questionable.”

Soon after the plans were announced, Lyniv issued a statement in protest, saying that she worried about “whitewashing” Currentzis.

“I cannot be responsible to the almost 150 musicians who are traveling to Vienna from the war in Ukraine to be put in the same context as Teodor Currentzis,” she said in a statement at the time. “Currentzis’s connections to Russia and his silence on this war of aggression against my homeland make it impossible for me to appear in a context with him at the moment.”

Lyniv, who is in New York this month preparing to conduct “Turandot” at the Metropolitan Opera, said she was pleased by the festival’s decision but declined to comment further.

As he searched for a solution, Rau spoke in recent days with artists and administrators. He said that he had received more than 50 messages about his decision to cancel the performance by Currentzis, many of them critical.

“The festival is big; we have 35 productions,” he said. “But in this specific case I failed, and I’m sad about it. But I’ve failed so many times. It’s part of the job.”

NAOMI O’LEARY Europe Correspondent The balance of power in the European Parliament is set for a hard shift to the right after elections in June, according to a study forecasting results from across the continent.

Populist parties critical of the European Union are set to come first in nine countries, including Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland, and to come either second or third in a further nine countries including Germany and Spain, according to the study commissioned by the European Council on Foreign Relations.

The forecasts indicate that a coalition of conservatives, the centre-right, and hard-right populists may hold a majority in the parliament for the first time, with far-reaching implications for the EU’s ability to pass laws, particularly on green, progressive and foreign policy issues.

“In general, it’s going to be significantly more difficult for the European Parliament to pass legislation, because you have more and more people who are essentially opposed to the very idea of the European Union passing legislation in the first place,” said Kevin Cunningham, a lecturer in politics and a lead author of the study.

‘Regrettable casualties’ “Climate action may be one of the more regrettable casualties,” he said.

The centre-right European People’s Party, of which Fine Gael is a member, is still forecast to be the largest political group, though with a reduced number of seats.

The centre-left group, the Greens, and the centrist Renew Europe party of Fianna Fáil are all set to shrink.

Far-right candidates are expected to be elected in large numbers in France, Germany and Italy, potentially tipping the balance of power in the parliament into new territory.

Based on voting records, the forecast predicts that a majority in the new parliament will support very restrictive immigration policies, while potentially also blocking legislation on addressing climate change or attempts to sanction countries such as Hungary for backsliding on the rule of law.

Sympathetic to Russia There is also set to be a larger number of MEPs who are sympathetic to Russia.

The study forecasts that a majority in the parliament will still favour helping Ukraine, though national parties may soften their support as they respond to how the electorate has voted.

The forecast for Ireland is somewhat out of step with much of the EU, with the largest number of MEPs forecast to be elected in the Left group, in a mix of Sinn Féin and Independent candidates.

The number of Fine Gael MEPs is forecast to fall, while Labour is projected to win back one seat and the Green Party to drop from two seats to one.

“Ireland is slightly different,” Cunningham said, putting this down to constituency dynamics, the role of Independents and the strong advantage of incumbent candidates.

“It will remain the case that the Irish MEPs are more progressive.”

Nevertheless, current polling and voting history suggests there is a “clear opportunity” for a conservative-minded, anti-immigration candidate in the constituency of Midlands-North-West, and potentially also in the Connacht-Ulster region, according to Mr Cunningham.

The election will take place from June 6th-9th with voting across the EU and will be held in Ireland on June 7th, in tandem with local elections.

BRUSSELS, Feb. 1, 2024 /CNW/ -- Results for the year ending 31 December 2023

Financial highlights

Euroclear continues to separate Russian sanction-related earnings from the underlying financial results and retain these profits until further guidance is provided on the distribution or management of such profits.

* Underlying business income reached a record EUR 1,658 million, an increase of 3% year-on-year.

* Underlying net profit increased by 63% to almost EUR 1 billion, driven by a robust business performance and a high interest rates environment.

* Underlying operating expenses increased by 14% to EUR 1,290 million, on higher inflation and increased investments in line with our strategic ambition to develop digital capabilities and IT infrastructure. The impact of inflation on the group's workforce and non-payroll related costs accounted for an increase of around 5% compared to 2022.

* Net interest earnings amounted to EUR 5.5 billion, of which EUR 4.4 billion relate to interests linked to Russian sanctions.

* The Russian sanctions and countermeasures resulted in direct costs of EUR 62 million and a loss of business income of EUR 24 million.

* Group impairments were recorded in 2023 totalling EUR 125 million, principally related to the impairment of part of the goodwill of our Swedish CSD. The harsher economic conditions and reduced volumes combined with an increase in costs are expected to persist, leading to reduced long-term projections. This has resulted in an impairment of EUR 100 million of the goodwill of the group's Swedish CSD.

* Euroclear achieved an underlying EBITDA margin of 57.4%, an increase of 9.7 percentage points compared to 2022.

* Underlying earnings per share rose by 63% to EUR 312.1 per share, reflecting the continued increase in net profit.

* The Board proposes to pay a dividend per share of EUR 210 in the third quarter of 2024. This represents an increase of 82% and maintains the pay-out ratio at 60% of the underlying earnings.

Lieve Mostrey, Chief Executive Officer of Euroclear Group, commented:

"2023 was another turbulent year, with geopolitical tensions impacting our macro-economic reality and the global capital markets. In times of complexity and market uncertainty, it is rewarding to know that our diverse client base continues to rely on us for safety and efficiency in processing and safeguarding their assets.

In 2023, we reached a record underlying business income of EUR 1,658 million and an underlying net profit of almost EUR 1 billion, driven by a robust business performance and a high interest rates environment. We also made solid progress in delivering on our strategic objectives, maintaining our focus on clients, while further developing ESG, data and digital capabilities, and continuing to grow our business internationally. Key achievements include the launch of the Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) service, the successful connection of Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Finland to the European Central Bank's T2S settlement system and the opening of a new Tech Hub in Krakow, allowing us to create 400 new jobs.

As we recently announced a leadership transition and the selection of Valérie Urbain as my successor, this is my last set of full-year results as CEO of Euroclear. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our colleagues across the entire group for their commitment and dedication in delivering another robust performance, servicing our clients and contributing to preserve the certainty, fluidity, and safety of our markets."

Robust business performance in subdued market conditions

With a record underlying business income of EUR 1,658 million (+ 3% year-on-year), Euroclear continues to deliver growth despite subdued market conditions. In contrast with 2022, which was characterised by volatile markets following the invasion of Ukraine, 2023 saw market activity slightly decrease while equities valuations recovered. Fixed-income issuance performed well. The diversification of Euroclear's business continues to provide resilience thanks to its subscription-like model as approximately three quarters of the group's business income is decoupled from financial market valuation.

* Eurobond and European assets performance resulted from solid issuance and partial recovery of equities valuations, in spite of lower levels of trading compared to last year in most markets.

* The investment funds business also suffered from lower activity mainly impacting mutual funds. ETF investment remained strong.

* Revenue emanating from the Collateral Highway increased despite reduced volumes for lending and borrowing.

* Global and Emerging Markets performance remained solid amid interest in new, emerging markets.

In 2023, Euroclear progressed the renewed Group Strategy announced in 2022, laying the foundations for the next phase of Euroclear's diversification and growth.

Embracing digital assets

In line with Euroclear's aspiration to become a digital and data-enabled financial market infrastructure, a D²-FMI, it launched its new Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) service in September 2023.

The service enables the issuance, distribution and settlement of fully digital international securities - Digitally Native Notes (DNN) - on distributed ledger technology (DLT). The inaugural DNN was issued by the World Bank, raising EUR 100 million to support its sustainable development activities. The DNN is automatically linked to the traditional settlement platform of Euroclear for secondary market operations, ensuring investors full access to liquidity.

Separately, in December 2023, Fnality, an international consortium of banks and financial institutions, including Euroclear, announced it had completed the first blockchain payments at the Bank of England. Fnality aims to bring central bank money in a digital tokenized form with near-real-time 24/7 settlement capability to allow banks to significantly reduce their intraday liquidity requirements.

Growing the funds business

Building on its acquisitions of MFEX and Goji, Euroclear has continued to enhance its service offering in investment funds with the launch of a new service targeting private market funds. Leveraging Goji's capabilities and the FundSettle platform, the new service complements Euroclear's existing money market, mutual and alternative fund offerings. The launch of the new service also follows the gradual inclusion of MFEX's distribution and data services into the FundSettle platform.

To further streamline Euroclear's funds offering and reflect its ambition to create a true one-stop-shop offering to clients across the full spectrum of funds products, Euroclear's funds offering transitioned to a new brand name, Euroclear FundsPlace.

Euroclear also continued to deploy innovative services for fund distributors globally. In 2023, several clients from Europe and Asia chose Euroclear's fund platform for the onboarding of their investment funds. Euroclear provides a one-stop-shop solution for fund distribution and execution services via its extensive network, allowing these clients to have access to more than 100,000 funds.

Forging stronger connections

Euroclear fully supports the need for integrated, deep and liquid capital markets within the European Union. As a common settlement platform for Europe, the European Central Bank's TARGET2-Securities (T2S) system underpins this harmonised environment.

Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Finland successfully completed the connection to the European Central Bank's T2S settlement system in late 2023. By joining this common infrastructure, the Finnish CSD can offer its users delivery-versus-payment settlement of securities and cash in euro and Danish krone central bank money.

Euroclear also continues to grow its international ecosystem in Asia. Euroclear Bank and the Korea Securities Depository took further step in making the Korean market "Euroclearable" by signing an agreement to open an omnibus account structure in August 2023. The link will allow international investors efficient post-trade access to KTBs.

Acting responsibly

In 2023, Euroclear continued to build on its strong ESG foundations established in previous years. It has started work on implementing the principles laid out in its ESG Board policy and begun to measure progress against the ESG KPIs which were approved in early 2023. Euroclear has made progress against its commitments in many areas, meeting its supply-chain screening targets, receiving approval for its targets from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and broadening its training offer. Actions are ongoing to integrate ESG into its current service offering, together with its business partners Impact Cubed and Greenomy.

Within its workplace, Euroclear aims to foster a healthy, performant and learning-orientated corporate culture. Last year, Euroclear onboarded 800 new employees and started to work with the World Economic Forum as one of its partners for 'The Good Work Alliance' which commits to building a more resilient, equitable, inclusive and just future of work.

Shareholder evolution

In recent years, Euroclear's shareholder base has evolved from its traditional "user-owned" model to include a greater proportion of longer-term institutional investors. In 2023, the group welcomed two new shareholders: New Zealand Super Fund and Novo Holdings, each holding 4.99% and 3.22% respectively.

Furthermore, two of Euroclear's main shareholders reinforced their holding last year. Société Fédérale de Participations et d'Investissement (SFPI/FPIM) acquired 1.79% from various sellers, and now holds 12.92%, while Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (CDC) increased its holding by 4.19%, and now holds 10.91%.

The long-term investment vision and commitment of this increasingly diversified shareholder base strengthens Euroclear's position as a neutral and open financial market infrastructure.

As announced on 15 January 2024, Valérie Urbain has been chosen by the Board as the successor to Lieve Mostrey as Chief Executive Officer of the Euroclear group. Having received the relevant regulatory approvals, Lieve Mostrey and Valérie Urbain will ensure a smooth and orderly transition period until the renewal of the Euroclear Board member mandates at the General Meeting on 3 May 2024.

Lieve Mostrey has led Euroclear as group CEO since January 2017. Under her tenure, Euroclear grew its business, expanded its global footprint, enriched its funds offering notably through the acquisitions of MFEX and Goji and accelerated value creation for shareholders, while at the same time securing CSDR licenses for each of its operating entities.

With over 30 years of experience at Euroclear in a variety of senior roles, including as Head of Human Resources of Euroclear Group, CEO of Euroclear Bank and most recently as Chief Business Officer, Valérie brings unparalleled knowledge of Euroclear, clients and market trends. She has been a key architect of its successful business strategy.

Update on Russian sanctions and countermeasures

The number of sanctions and countersanctions that have been introduced since February 2022 are unprecedented and continue to have a significant impact on the daily operations of Euroclear. While new sanctions were issued at a declining pace in 2023, these still resulted in more breakage of straight-through process and increased manual interventions.

Well-established processes are in place which allow the group to implement the sanctions, while maintaining the normal course of business. However, one consequence of the sanctions is that blocked coupon payments and redemptions owed to sanctioned entities results in an accumulation of cash on Euroclear Bank's balance sheet. At the end of 2023, Euroclear Bank's balance sheet had increased by EUR 38 billion year-on-year to a total of EUR 162 billion.

Euroclear's priority has been to manage the sanctions according to the spirit and letter of the law. As per Euroclear's standard procedures, Euroclear does not remunerate cash balances and such cash balances are re-invested to minimise risk and capital requirements. Prudent management of such risks is a requirement under Euroclear's Risk Appetite and Policies and expected by the EU Capital Requirements Regulation. The interest received on the reinvestment of cash balances is net interest income earned by Euroclear.

In 2023, interest arising on cash balances from Russia-sanctioned assets was approx. EUR 4.4 billion. Such interest earnings are driven by two factors: (i) the prevailing interest rates and (ii) the amount of cash balances that Euroclear is required to invest. Subject to Belgian corporate tax, these earnings will generate EUR 1,085 million tax revenue for the Belgian State in 2023. As such, future earnings will be influenced by the evolving interest rate environment and the size of cash balances as the sanctions evolve.

Since considerable uncertainties persist, Euroclear considers it necessary to separate the estimated sanction-related earnings from the underlying financial results when assessing the company's performance and resources.

Euroclear is faced with a high level of complexity in managing both the wide-ranging package of sanctions and a set of countermeasures, which Russia has implemented to try to mitigate the impact of the sanctions. Euroclear allocates considerable time, resources and capital to manage market issues, potential risks and implications of these countermeasures, while maintaining regular dialogue with clients and other stakeholders.

Overall, Euroclear incurred additional direct costs from the management of Russian sanctions of EUR 62 million in 2023, with considerable senior management and Board focus on the topic. Additionally, the international sanctions and Russian countermeasures have resulted in a loss of activities from sanctioned clients and Russian securities, which negatively impacted business income by EUR 24 million.

2023 also saw various parties contest the consequences of the application of sanctions, with a significant number of legal proceedings ongoing, almost exclusively in Russian courts. Claimants have initiated legal proceeding aiming mainly to access the assets blocked in Euroclear's books. Despite all legal actions taken by Euroclear and the considerable resources mobilised, the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions. Euroclear will continue to defend itself against all legal claims.

In parallel, the Board notes that the European Commission is contemplating various options to use the profits generated by the reinvestment of sanctioned amounts held by financial institutions, including Euroclear, for the financing of Ukraine's reconstruction.

Euroclear is focused on minimising potential legal and operational risks that may arise for itself and its clients from the implementation of any proposals from the European Commission. The company continues to act in a transparent manner with all authorities involved and to retain profits related to the international sanctions applicable on Russian assets until further guidance is provided on the distribution or management of such profits.

Euroclear continues to monitor and assess the potential impact of post balance sheet events on its 2023 financial statements.

Roman Ivanov on the development and modernization of UAVs

The Orlan-10 reconnaissance aerial vehicle has been holding a title of the bedrock of unmanned aviation of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation for many years already. Chief Designer of the Special Technology Center (STC) Roman Ivanov explained how the Orlan-10 and Orlan-30 drones were being improved in the course of the special military operation in Ukraine and how the designers feel about attempts of the western specialists to replicate Russia's multifunctional unmanned aerial vehicle.

Question: Roman Vyacheslavovich, the Orlan is often referred to as the most wildly used reconnaissance drone during the special military operation. Is this true?

Roman Ivanov: A huge number of various short-range drones are available nowadays and these aerial vehicles are really wildly used - we see thousands of them. However, there are not so many Orlan drones in the zone of the special military operation - fewer than a thousand. If we consider their massive involvement in combat operations, the Orlan drone does not see extensive combat. But at the same time, the difference between our unmanned aerial vehicles and the whole army of various FPV-drones that have recently appeared, is that the Orlan can stay aloft for a long time and perform more tasks during one flight than any other electric drone. The military reports about 60-70% of reconnaissance data is due to our drones.

Question: The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation took on strength the Orlan-10 drones back in 2012 and since then their choice remains unchanged. Why do you think other more modern drones did not replace them over these years?

Roman Ivanov: Over the past 10-12 years, our aerial vehicles have been seriously upgraded. Despite the fact that the drone has the same name and its design remained unchanged, a lot of changes have been made and we are constantly improving our UAVs. The latest Orlan-10 is not the same drone that it was in 2012. Many functions have been added and mission equipment has been also seriously upgraded. As a matter of fact, it is actually a basic platform. The Orlan-10 platform used to build new complexes, their difference lies not only in tactical and technical characteristics but they also have different set of functions: some of them are equipped with electronic warfare systems, others fulfill reconnaissance and strike functions - these are our recent developments.

Question: How were the unmanned aerial vehicles produced by the Special Technological Center being upgraded during the special military operation? It is known that the enemy has already studied the Orlan drones and is constantly improving its technologies and looking for our points of vulnerability.

Roman Ivanov: I can hardly answer many questions until the special military operation is over but we have worked over the communications control system. When during the battle of Kharkiv, the Orlan-10 drone with the ground station and all documentation was lost, it became quite clear that we would not be able to use previous communications control systems. After that we improved the communications control system in regard to the data transmission channels. They were modernized and we made them jam-resistant.

Question: How many Orlan drones do you make now?

Roman Ivanov: More than a thousand drones a year.

Question: Do you continue upgrading the Orlan drones?

Roman Ivanov: Yes, we do. This is a never ending process. We see how we are being countered and of course we are looking for various ways to protect ourselves. STC also produces anti-drone systems.

Question: The international press said that Russia's strategy to use the Orlan together with the Lantset loitering drone is "a nightmare for the Ukrainian armed forces". The unmanned aerial vehicle has been equipped with laser designation and correction of high-precision munitions systems. How is the interaction between the Orlan and Lantset drones being established?

Roman Ivanov: We are making an instrument - a multifunctional reconnaissance complex. Radio-technical reconnaissance (capability to locate the radio emitter) is not executed on small-sized tactical unmanned aerial vehicles. That is why our customer - the military, in particular, is carrying out this interaction rather than we are as a designer. As far as I know, the Orlan and Lantset does not interact directly much. The Orlan allows determining the position of the enemy to be hit. We usually employ artillery systems to conduct a strike but when the target is too far, the Lantset can, probably, be used.

Question: The Orlan UAV was used in Syria, it is a very well-known drone. What countries are procuring this drone?

Roman Ivanov: It is not easy to acquire this drone. This is mainly due to the fact that the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation knows that this is high-grade military equipment and is using it on the battlefield. As a matter of fact, it is banned to export these drones. However, we are demonstrating the Orlan UAV at various international military-technical forums. We are assessing demand today - it is swelling substantially. We hope when the active phase of the operation is over and the supply exceeds the demand, we shall deliver the drones to other countries as well. But we still have only a few direct supplies abroad.

Question: Some designers say that the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation is now discussing the possibility of making the Orlan under license on the capacities of other Russian design bureaus. Since, let us say, 100 vehicles are produced every month while the Ministry of Defense needs 1,000. Is it true?

Roman Ivanov: There is a severe problem here, it is mainly related to the supply dynamics in a certain period of time. The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation needs these unmanned aerial vehicles to appear yesterday. In the worst-case scenario - tomorrow. STC has received such requests, and we hope to find contractors, who would be able to help ramp up volume of drones production but this is quite a difficult task from technological point of view and only a few contractors can fulfill it. It is extremely difficult to meet the deadline, it will take about a year to set up our production. Indeed, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, as a possessor of these developments, would like to diversify the production process but no one sees when it can be done. It goes without saying, they may set a task to produce the Orlan-10 drones somewhere else but I do not think they will be able to do it quicker than to ramp up production at our capacities.

The Special Technology Center has tried to produce its Orlan drones at other enterprises. None of the companies managed to demonstrate the similar results. There were three or four attempts in Russia and now I have heard about three attempts in Ukraine. A Czech-Ukrainian company has exhibited a mockup of the Orlan-10 drone at the recent exhibition in Abu Dhabi. Let's see what they can do. We are likely to get these drones soon because they are being handed over to the Armed Forces of Ukraine to fight against Russia and we will inevitably capture them.

Question: You are successful when you see you are being replicated. Does it make you happy or not?

Roman Ivanov: That is good to know. It is nice that in 2023 they are replicating our unmanned aerial vehicle designed in 2010. What they can take, they will take but I should say again the situation is that the basic technical solutions are very sophisticated and even if they have all technical documents and our designer supervision, it is difficult to replicate these engineering solutions. The fact that the Orlan drones are being replicated means that they do not have enough competence to design their own drone and cannot outperform Russia. It will be a replica that will be eventually worse than the original drone.

Question: Does STC have plans to expand its own production capacities?

Roman Ivanov: It goes without saying we are expanding our production capacities several-fold. We were tasked to multiply production of our drones. We tripled production of the Orlan-10 drones, while production of the Orlan-30 has been increased 25 times compared to 2021.

We are also delivering our components for communication systems to the Kalashnikov Concern and other production facilities. Someone will likely start buying our components because they are made well and perform successfully rather than they will take our military equipment and decide to make it.

Question: Is STC now designing any advanced unmanned systems?

Roman Ivanov: I usually say that we will have new Orlan drones. Our entire line is dubbed Orlan and they are absolutely different. Technical requirements and documents are classified and I can hardly give you any details. There will be both airplane and copter solutions and probably some other unmanned aerial vehicles that will not be demonstrated soon. This is our future.

We are putting all our efforts into production and modernization of our serial products amid special military operation and it is almost impossible to design something new. The Special Technology Center produces a very large volume of military equipment. Ideally, there is a lot of R&D works because we are losing many components due to western sanction issues and we need to redesign our equipment.

The most vivid example is engines. We are using Japanese engines and the last batch was purchased in 2020. Until 2023, we used Japanese engines from our stocks but in 2023 they ran out. Still in 2023, we engineered new engines. We used to have four-stroke engines but now we have a two-stroke engine that runs almost on par with the Japanese one. Moreover, we are making it almost by ourselves. STC is producing new military equipment and it will look like the existing Orlan-10 and Orlan-30 but inner components of the vehicles will be completely different.

Question: Will STC's future advanced systems be also designed to fulfill reconnaissance and fire adjustment tasks or they will have new capabilities?

Roman Ivanov: As of today, the Orlan-10 drone comprises about 60 mission equipment and fire adjustment variants and this is 1-3% of what it is capable for. We are expanding this range. Our target loads, in many respects, are getting old. And the enemy is also moving forward, building up some capabilities: somewhere it goes into other ranges and we have to upgrade our military equipment. But the drones should have at least visual reconnaissance and optics. Meanwhile, other options that we do not usually talk about and that nobody knows about are performing their functions exceptionally well. I should say we are quiet forces doing their work.

Question: STC has a training center where various unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations specialists are being trained. Do you train personnel to be deployed to the zone of the special military operation?

Roman Ivanov: This is rather a sensitive matter for our customer and for us as well. It is associated with the fact that the customer needs people today and they need them well trained. But in order to train them well, a number of conditions must be fulfilled. They should have material and technical means in the course of training and they also need enough time to polish their skills. We do not do simple things. They say a week is enough to learn how to operate a drone. Yes, it can be enough but you will learn how to rise it in the air and bring it back under simple conditions without counterwork. Our systems are more sophisticated.

The state unmanned aircraft systems operators course requires 3.5 months of training if you already have initial vocational or higher education. After completion of 3.5-month training and from 25 to 40 flying hours, you will be able to get a certificate. Given the current situation, the customer says that it is a very long training period and is not ready to freeze his people for a 3.5-month period because the military does not have enough UAV operators. And they initiate some accelerated courses with vague results.

Graduates of our center are, of course, better trained than graduates of other training centers. It can be explained that we have a really good base but the training process is not cheap. We are running into an issue when the customer feels upset that the tuition fee goes beyond RUB 1 million. It seems incorrect that such training course costs so much money. In fact, students are exhausting aircraft resource just for 2-3 months.

The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation has flagged the need to train UAV operators on a mass scale. We are now considering various ways of fulfilling their initiative. We will therefore be trying to launch this training course.

The Head of State and the head of the Italian government discussed the cooperation between the countries and agreed on further steps during Italy's presidency of the Group of Seven (G7). The President thanked Italy for its support of defense capabilities and the reconstruction of Ukraine, which are identified as priority issues during Italy's presidency, as well as for its decision to continue providing military-technical assistance to our state until the end of 2024.

"Italy holds the presidency of the G7 this year. Therefore, we highly value its presence here today with us," said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Separately, the President thanked the Prime Minister of Italy for organizing a G7+Ukraine meeting on the occasion of the second anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion. Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted Italy's role in bringing Ukraine closer to full membership in the EU.

The Head of State also expressed gratitude for Italy's patronage over Odesa and the Italian government's plans for the reconstruction of Ukrainian historical monuments damaged in hostilities.

Following the meeting, the President of Ukraine and the Prime Minister of the Italian Republic signed a Security Cooperation Agreement between the two countries.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy summarized that this document lays a solid foundation for a long-term security partnership between Ukraine and Italy.

The agreement was signed to extend the provisions of the Joint Declaration adopted by Ukraine and G7 members in Vilnius on July 12, 2023.

The agreement outlines the main components of Italy's security commitments, including long-term military and financial assistance throughout its duration. The agreement identifies priority areas for bilateral security cooperation between Ukraine and Italy in military and non-military spheres, including political, financial, humanitarian, and reform sectors.

The document specifies that Italy will continue to address Ukraine's most urgent needs to strengthen its security capabilities. The Italian Republic has already extended the relevant legislation for 2024, allowing for further military support, and will provide assistance to Ukraine for ten years under this agreement.

Additionally, Italy will continue to contribute to the EU Mission providing military assistance to Ukraine by conducting training for servicemen.

Furthermore, the Italian Republic will continue its partnership with Odesa and the region to provide support, reconstruction, enhance resilience, and implement reforms.

Specific sections of the document outline cooperation on issues such as sanction pressure on the aggressor and holding Russia accountable.

The agreement specifies the concrete amounts of financial support and military packages provided to Ukraine by Italy since the beginning of the full-scale Russian aggression, with the commitment of the Italian Republic to continue providing such assistance throughout the ten years of the agreement's validity.

Moreover, the document confirms Italy's support for Ukraine's future NATO membership, particularly by supporting Ukrainian reforms and compatibility of Ukraine's Security and Defense Forces with the Alliance.

The agreement establishes a mechanism for 24-hour emergency response in case of renewed military aggression against Ukraine.

The document is valid for ten years from the date of signing and allows for review by the partners if Ukraine joins NATO before its expiration.

"On the day of the second anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, we once again prove that despite all the difficulties and challenges, Ukraine will only grow stronger and will always be, together with its partners, in the free world," said Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a meeting with representatives of the media following negotiations with foreign leaders at the Mariyinsky Palace in Kyiv.

The Head of State thanked everyone who helps Ukraine, all leaders, public and political figures, entrepreneurs, and all the people of the world who are with Ukraine in heart and deed, with our soldiers and our people.

"Thank you to each of you, dear friends! And I am proud that today so many people in the world support our country," said the President.

Separately, Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the Prime Minister of Canada for signing a bilateral security agreement, which opens up new opportunities for cooperation between Ukraine and Canada in the security sphere.

"Defense support is formalized for a year, and the agreement, like all others, will work until our accession to NATO. The principled position of Canada's support for Ukraine's membership in the Alliance is recorded. Concrete opportunities for cooperation in defense production, intelligence, cyber security, demining, and protection of our critical infrastructure are also recorded. And this is far from the entire content of the agreement," said the Head of State.

Additionally, as the President said, the security agreement concluded today between Ukraine and Italy contains key aspects of interaction, particularly at the European and Euro-Atlantic levels.

"We appreciate Italy's decision to continue supporting Ukraine, our people, and our soldiers until the end of 2024 and throughout the duration of our agreement. And I am grateful that security issues will continue to be a priority in the activities of the largest democracies - in the G7," said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

"We must do everything possible and within our power to make 2024 a decisive year for restoring real and long-term security for Ukraine, Europe, and the world," the Head of State said.

President of Ukraine also held a trilateral meeting with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and Alexander De Croo, the Prime Minister of Belgium, which currently holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union.

"We have reached a political decision to open negotiations on membership. And we are ready to receive a negotiation framework and then start negotiations on Ukraine's accession to the EU. We can do all this during Belgium's presidency - together with you, Mr. Prime Minister. This will not only be a clear indication that a united Europe does not succumb to any Putin's blackmail, but also evidence that Europe recognizes and respects the full commitment of the Ukrainian people to European values and solidarity. Together, we must address each of the existing disagreements in Europe, and we must together defend our Europe against all forms of Russian aggression against Europe. Our Europe is and will remain among the global leaders," noted Volodymyr Zelensky and expressed gratitude to Ursula von der Leyen and Alexander De Croo.

Prime Minister of Italy Giorgia Meloni said that her country provides military and humanitarian support to Ukraine. Additionally, she highlighted the cooperation between the two countries in the economic sector, various industrial sectors, and the energy sector.

"Today's signing of the agreement confirms that Italy will continue to provide necessary support for the freedom and independence of Ukraine - a country against which aggression has been committed - helping it to build its future," said Giorgia Meloni.

The Prime Minister of Italy emphasized support for negotiations on Ukraine's accession to the European Union.

"I want to say to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the entire Ukrainian people: you are not alone. We are deeply grateful to you for continuing the fight to defend Europe and our security. Because the security of Ukraine and the security of Europe truly coincide," she affirmed.

President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen emphasized the continuation of support for Ukraine, particularly through providing military, financial assistance, and further sanction pressure on the military-political leadership of Russia.

"We have already provided half a million units of ammunition, and by the end of the year, we will reach the level of one million. Also, 60,000 soldiers are trained with our assistance," she said.

The President of the European Commission said that Ukraine must be capable of successfully defending itself in the future, so the EU wants to strengthen the defense capabilities of our state as part of the European system.

"We are developing a strategy for the defense industry, which we will present in three weeks. This will be the first step in integrating Ukraine into our defense industrial programs. At the same time, we are learning from you, from your experience on the battlefield. We want to intensify this cooperation and open an innovative defense office in Kyiv," Ursula von der Leyen said.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emphasized that the security agreement between Ukraine and Canada involves providing our state with financial assistance of CAD 3 billion.

"This support will continue what we have been doing since 2022; we will continue to provide it. It includes serious support for the armored coalition - this is our strong point - and will allow us to demonstrate leadership among partners. As well as support for the fighter jet coalition, continuing our commitments we made in July. We are focused on the long-term perspective so that Ukraine can achieve a complete victory over Putin," said the head of the Canadian government.

Prime Minister of Belgium Alexander De Croo assured of the continuation of support for Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.

"This year, Belgium's military contribution will be over one billion. We are part of the F-16 coalition and are training your pilots so that they can deploy fighters to protect your skies as quickly as possible," he said.

Alexander De Croo announced that Belgium has decided to open offices of the Belgian Development Agency in Kyiv and Kharkiv. According to him, the issue of rebuilding Ukraine is extremely important, and Russia must pay for it. The Prime Minister of Belgium also said that the issue of using frozen Russian assets is currently being worked out.

Main themes on selected current affairs programmes on German TV on 19-21 February

During the period under review, the German broadcasters focused on the the second anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the death of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny.

War in Ukraine

As the war in Ukraine enters a third year, Russian forces have gone back on the offensive and, after months of intense fighting, captured the eastern city of Avdiivka

"At this point, the Russians are advancing along the front in 17 locations," said Col Markus Reisner from the Austrian army, in his weekly analysis on commercial broadcaster n-tv's weekly programme Ukraine Spezial on 19 February at 15:00 GMT. "The breaches in the Ukrainian defensive positions are mostly still locally limited, but they show that Ukraine is on the defensive." At the same time, Reisner said it was too early to say that the war was being lost for Ukraine. Much depended on whether the promised ammunition from Ukraine's partners would arrive there soon. "At the moment, Ukraine's biggest problem is not morale, but ammunition."

On the tactical level, he explained, the problem of Ukraine receiving too little ammunition had clearly been evident in Avdiivka in recent weeks. The shortage of artillery ammunition was particularly glaring, where "we observe the superiority of the Russian side over Ukraine along the front at a ratio of one to six to one to ten". The latter was especially evident in heavyweight areas, and Avdiivka was a heavyweight area for the Russians.

The inferiority in artillery ammunition was particularly glaring because this ammunition would give the Ukrainians the ability to target Russian artillery groupings. So far, the Russians had been kept to some extent in check because of the massive Ukrainian shelling. "This is no longer possible now: because the massive Ukrainian shelling is absent, the Russians can form artillery groupings that act effectively," the Austrian military expert continued. Due to the massive artillery barrage by the Russians, the Ukrainians in Avdiivka were also no longer able to launch a counterattack with the third Azov storm brigade.

Kamikaze drones to compensate for ammunition shortage

Ukraine had tried to compensate for its inferiority in artillery ammunition with kamikaze drones. But these first-person-view drones have very limited range, only reaching up to two or three kilometers. Artillery reached targets at distances of 25 to 30 kilometers or even more. "So, the loss of Avdiivka can certainly be attributed to the fact that there simply wasn't enough ammunition available in the end," Reisner said.

Reisner also spoke about the defence lines behind Avdiivka, to which the Ukrainian armed forces had to retreat. He sai that in the next days we would see whether they were holding up against the renewed Russian attacks. But, "the question also is whether the Russian side is capable of immediately following up", he emphasised. After the capture of the contested area, there was talk of an operational pause, during which, for example, new units could be brought in. The Ukrainians had essentially established three defence lines in Donbas - not just now, but already in the years after 2014.

According to the colonel, the cities along these defence lines, such as Avdiivka, but also Bakhmut, had been effectively turned into "fortresses". That's why there was such prolonged and intense fighting around these cities. "Because if they fall, an important defence stronghold is lost. Over the past two years, the Russians have repeatedly managed to achieve breakthroughs, mainly through massive artillery fire. The first time was in May 2022 in Popasna. There, the first line was breached. Almost a year later, in Soledar and Bakhmut, a breakthrough of the second line was achieved. Avdiivka, on the other hand, was a fortress of the first line," Reisner recalled. The question now is whether the Ukrainians were quick enough to fortify their positions west of Avdiivka in order to hold them. Especially since the second line was by no means as heavily fortified as the first line. "The Ukraine had eight years to build bunkers of steel and concrete there. After February 2022, this was hardly possible for the second line anymore, as attention was focused on the fighting directly at the front," he explained.

Momentum now on Russian side

The momentum is clearly with the Russians at the moment. This is evident from the fact that they are advancing in 17 locations in five sectors. The breaches in the Ukrainian defensive positions are mostly still locally limited, but they show that Ukraine is on the defensive. "With the fall of Avdiivka, this has escalated in the last fourteen days. The Ukrainians have tried to get as many soldiers and equipment out as possible and even tried to launch a counterattack. But it was caught in the fire of the Russians, partly with heavy losses," Resiner said.

"A similar situation is currently unfolding in Zaporizhzhya Region, where Ukraine attempted in the summer to advance towards Tokmak and ultimately Melitopol to conquer the area up to the Sea of Azov. There, between the villages of Robotyne and Verbove, is the only place where Ukraine has managed to break through the first line of Rusisan defensive positions. It can be assumed that the Russians are exerting pressure there at the moment, possibly to advance beyond the breach towards Orikhiv," the Austrian military analyst explained.

Too early to speak of Ukraine's defeat

However, according to Reisner, "it would be too early" to say that Ukraine is losing the war. "It cannot be said now. It depends crucially on how capable the new commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces is of stopping these advances," he said. On the Russian side, there are around 500,000 men deployed. These 500,000 soldiers were essentially divided along the front into six main groupings. There was still a secondary grouping in Crimea and other secondary groupings north of Kyiv. These main groupings have a total of approximately 3,000 tanks, 7,000 infantry fighting vehicles, probably around 5,000 artillery systems, and 1,200 multiple rocket launchers, according to Reisner. And they are supported by approximately 300 warplanes and 300 helicopters. "These figures are obtained by analyzing publicly available information and the current Russian order of battle. With these massive forces, Russia is trying to break through. In a month, presidential elections will take place in Russia, and they want to present results beyond Avdiivka. In Ukraine's partner countries, ammunition production is being increased, but Ukraine needs it now to repel a looming Russian advance," Reisner said.

After the interviewer, n-tv reporter Hubertus Volmer suggested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky didn't seem very confident during his appearance at the Munich Security Conference. Reisner responded: "President Zelensky is trying to convey that the situation is really serious. We must not forget that this war is also an information war. At the beginning of the war, it was important for Ukraine to signal that the momentum was on its side. But I argue that Ukraine missed the point where it should have shown: 'It's serious. We have achieved some initial successes against the Russians, but we can't do it without massive support.' At the same time, there was an impression on the Western side that the Russian forces were amateurish and poorly equipped. Since the failure of the Ukrainian summer offensive, it should have been clear that the opponent is to be taken seriously, that everything necessary must be provided to the Ukrainians. On the tactical-operational level, especially artillery ammunition, but also everything needed to conduct an offensive. And at the strategic level, air defence systems and ammunition to counter the Russian strategic air campaign," Reisner explained. That's why, the military expert said, Zelensky had looked so "crestfallen" at the Munich Security Conference. There were indeed very significant agreements with Germany and France on security assurances. But this was overshadowed by the news of Navalny's assassination.

Sense of resignation at Munich Security Conference

Reisner recalled that the news of Navalny's death had been received with shock at the security conference, especially because shortly after, Alexei Navalny's wife tearfully gave a statement on stage. "My personal impression of the conference was that, unlike last year, there was a sense of resignation. There are increasingly more voices considering the possibility of a ceasefire. At the same time, it is communicated clearly that support for Ukraine is unwavering - hence the signing of the agreements with Germany and France," he emphasised. However, he continued, a war of attrition was primarily decided by resources and the key questions now are: Would these resources arrive in time or not? And could the West deliver the necessary quantities?

"Historians will later explain how this came about and why it was entirely clear. But right now, we don't have enough detailed information about the situations in the individual sections along the front. At the moment, Ukraine's biggest problem is not morale, but ammunition," Reisner said.

When talking about casualties and confronted with numbers reported by Russian exiled media outlet Mediazona that as of 14 February, at least 44,654 Russian soldiers had been killed in Ukraine, Reisner said: "I always rely on the numbers that come from the USA - I think they are very realistic. We can assume that so far, on both sides, a total of around 500,000 soldiers have fallen or been wounded: about 300,000 dead and wounded on the Russian side, and about 200,000 on the Ukrainian side. In addition, there are about 50,000, in the worst case up to 100,000, killed and injured civilians. It's difficult to say exactly."

Russia has better partners

Remarking on the anniversary of the large-scale invasion of Russia into Ukraine and assessing the situation after two years, Reisner commented that Russia had completely miscalculated its invasion. "The mistaken belief that Ukraine would not hold out for long has been shared by many in the West, including in the USA. It must be clearly stated that Ukraine accomplished incredible feats, especially at the beginning of the war. Regardless of the outcome of the war, this defensive success will go down in history," he emphasised.

But Russia has learned from this and begun to adapt, he stressed. "The result was the transition to a war of attrition, in which the Russians try to impose positional warfare on the Ukrainians time and again."

Navalny's death

The world marked the second anniversary of Russia's invasion on Ukraine, which occurred in February 2022. Around this date, the situation of the Ukrainian army on the battlefield is as dire as it has been since the early weeks of the war, especially after the Ukrainian soldiers retreated from the city of Avdiivka.

The lack of manpower and ammunition is particularly troubling for Kyiv. On the public broadcaster ARD's political talk show Maischberger on 20 February at 21:50 GMT, host Sandra Maischberger discussed with her guests the bloody war and further German support for the Ukraine. Another topic was the death of Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny.

Navalny endured the worst Stalinists methods

Exiled Russian pundit Irina Scherbakova described the terrible conditions of Alexei Navalny's imprisonment, where he had to endure "the worst Stalinist methods" and "torture through hunger."

For the former head of the ARD studio in Moscow, Thomas Roth, Navalny's death was "of course not a surprise." It was a "slow-motion murder" due to the conditions of his imprisonment. Navalny's death, in his view, was a sign of weakness and a sign of the "moral and ethical depravity" of the Putin regime. Roth argued for not labeling and recognizing the next presidential elections in Russia as such. "These are not elections, it's a theater." He also advocated for strengthening the sanction regime and confronting Putin militarily in Ukraine with strength, "or else he'll be at the next doorstep."

Taurus missiles not listed

Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, defence policy spokeswoman for the FDP, explained why she supported the CDU/CSU faction's proposal for arms deliveries to Ukraine. "I want to call a spade a spade, and that is the Taurus cruise missile. In the government's proposal, the requested weapon system from Ukraine is not mentioned."

Strack-Zimmermann dismissed concerns that the Kyiv government could bomb civilian targets far into Russia with Taurus, which had a range of up to Moscow. "It's deep mistrust to assume that they want to bomb Moscow." But it should be possible for Ukraine to more effectively target Russian supply routes.

The former party leader of the Left Party, Amira Mohamed Ali, who recently switched to the Buendnis Sahra Wagenknecht, said that Ukraine could not win this war. Morally, she could understand this desire, but militarily, Kyiv was losing ground. She said that the conflict would escalate further and Nato would continue to intervene. "Then we'll have the third world war." She therefore called for a ceasefire, peace negotiations, and a peace order involving Russia. She considered a Russian attack on a NATO country possible "if the situation continues like this."

Deeply moving speech

Celebrity chef Christian Rach found the speech by Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, at the Munich Security Conference "incredibly moving": specifically, her explanation why she stayed in Munich and did not immediately go back to her children, as she stated in her speech, because her husband would have done the same. Rach advocated for increased military spending and rearmament in Germany.

The deputy editor-in-chief of Bild and war reporter Paul Ronzheimer explained that many intelligence agents believed something would happen to Navalny in prison. He reported on his latest visit to the front lines in eastern Ukraine. Soldiers were increasingly desperate because there was no new mobilization and they lackedcweapons. Nevertheless, the majority said they had to continue fighting. Ronzheimer criticized Germany and Europe for not having adjusted to the war in terms of arms production, while Russia has succeeded in it.

He was annoyed with some people in Germany who were complaining about the ongoing war in Ukraine. "The only ones who have the right to be war-weary are the Ukrainians," he said in a fiery monologue.

Germany in danger

The correspondent in the ARD capital studio Iris Sayram did not want to dismiss the danger that Germany could become a party to the war by delivering Taurus cruise missiles as "nonsense." In addition to hard power, such as arms deliveries to Kyiv, she missed soft power: attempts to end the war through negotiations. Sayram compared Navalny's case to the detention of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who faced decades of imprisonment if extradited to the US. It was a question of credibility when advocating for the rule of law, democracy, and press freedom. In Assange's case, "politics is very quiet currentl,," she criticized.

The entire twenty-five-minute conversation between Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann and Amira Mohamed Ali was filled with annoyed head shaking, talking over each other, and the raising of voices. Strack-Zimmermann, in particular, became increasingly loud when she tried to make Mohamed Ali understand how absurd she found her demand to end arms deliveries to Ukraine.

"Straight to the point. What do you want? Do you want Ukraine to give up its eastern part? Do you want Crimea to remain with Russia?" Mohamed Ali defended herself: "I want it to stop, that people die in Ukraine every day!" Strack-Zimmermann reacted, with maximum incomprehension to every sentence uttered by the Left Party politician: "Then call Moscow, not Kyiv. That's where it happens!", she exclaimed indignantly. Mohamed Ali replied: "These are always such tough words, my goodness. But that's not the reality."

Flower sales after Navalny's death seen as encouraging sign

Speaking about her expectations from the future of Russia after the death of Alexei Navalny, Irina Scherbakova called the silent commemorations and flower-laying for Navalny in dozens of Russian cities "an encouraging sign." Scherbakova spoke of the "largest mass reactions since the beginning of the war". Flowers were sold out everywhere in Moscow and St Petersburg. "Anger, despair, mourning have defeated fear in this situation."

The discussion offered little hope regarding the war in Ukraine. The guests agreed that the situation for Kyiv is extremely difficult at the moment. And it could become dramatic in the coming months due to a shortage of new military personnel and ammunition. Paul Ronzheimer's conclusion from his latest visit to the frontline: "The situation has never been as dramatic as since the beginning of the war."

War in Ukraine

The military conflict in Ukraine was escalating further - and after two years of war, there was still no end in sight. Most recently, Ukrainian troops suffered a setback in the fiercely contested city of Avdiivka. According to some observers, the capture of Avdiivka was the most significant military success for Moscow since the takeover of Bakhmut in May 2023.

On the public broadcaster ZDF's socio-political talk show Markus Lanz on 20 February at 21:55 GMT, an expert discussed the latest developments at the front and the further course of the war as well as the possibility of a Russian attack on a Nato member state.

Asked by Markus Lanz if Russia could attack a Nato member state in the near future, military expert Florence Gaub replied: "War against Russia is now seen by almost everyone as a real possibility." At the same time, she added: "We must face the fact (...) but we also have solutions to it." According to Gaub, one solution was the determination and cooperation of individual Nato members: "The more we come together - all invest, all get ready - then, of course, it sends the message to Russia: 'We resist.'"

Russian attack on Nato possible

At this point in time, however, an attack by Russia would be devastating, as Gaub had to admit: "Yes, the situation is serious!" If Russia were to attack today, according to the military expert, "we would really have a problem. But we still have some time. And we have resources, and above all, we are not alone."

Moderator Markus Lanz further inquired about where a Russian attack could be possible. Gaub cautiously responded that the "cheapest scenario for Russia" would be to launch a missile onto German soil and see how the Allies reacted. In this context, the expert noted that Russia had already been violating German airspace "for some time". According to Gaub, the "trick behind" was to "unsettle us", to make us "aware of our own weakness" and to give us the feeling of "you are not safe."

Gaub also stated that Russia excelled in exploiting "gray zones". When it came to cyber-attacks and the like, it was difficult for Nato to intervene accordingly and draw boundaries; "These are the areas that concern us." However, Germany's reaction to this should not be panic, but according to Gaub, the answer was to continue investing in the Bundeswehr and in Nato.

Nuclear bomb for Germany inconceivable

Lanz then asked if Germany having its own nuclear bomb would be conceivable. The military expert dismissed this, saying that nobody wanted this because the German DNA was politically deeply "anti-nuclear".

In a similar vein, Markus Lanz also spoke about the precarious situation in Ukraine and said, "This war continues with incredible harshness and brutality." With the fall of the city of Avdiivka, Ukraine lost, as ZDF correspondent Katrin Eigendorf explained from Kyiv, not only an "important bridgehead" in the east of the country, but the fall also had serious "moral consequences" for Ukrainians because it created the impression that they could not even "defend the country".

Eigendorf painted a frightening picture when she said, "There is a lack of soldiers, there is (...) a lack of ammunition in many areas of the army, there is a lack of equipment."

Ukrainians with their backs against the wall

The correspondent further explained on "Markus Lanz" that the war had now reached a phase where Ukrainians are "with their backs against the wall". "The situation is very dramatic," said Eigendorf. She added with concern that the Ukrainian population had begun to resign, as the war now also had a "major impact on people's living conditions". More and more Ukrainians were "impoverished" and have been living "in a situation of terror" for two years. Eigendorf elaborated: "At some point (...) you are worn out by this constant air raid alarm. And the situation has now worsened significantly because Russia is increasingly using drones."

Meanwhile, the Ukrainians could no longer achieve "really significant successes". Therefore, according to Eigendorf, the popularity of Zelensky has significantly decreased, and there was even an "open power struggle" between the opposition, the military leadership, and the Ukrainian president.

Crumbling image of unity

The image of a "united country" is starting to "crumble significantly." However, the alarming words of the ZDF correspondent caused Florence Gaub to shake her head. "Pessimism doesn't win wars," said the military expert. Lanz dryly countered, "But without ammunition, neither." Gaub was not deterred by this and continued to explain: "Of course, you have to acknowledge the facts as negative." Nevertheless, war was always "terrible" and caused "a lot of suffering".

According to Gaub, it was therefore "ultimately counterproductive" to look pessimistically at Ukraine because it suggested to Russia, "we will soon abandon the Ukrainians because there is nothing more to gain". Instead, it was much more important to offer "continued support" to Ukraine and promise the country "everything necessary" to achieve the goal in the end." Gaub added: "For every dead Ukrainian, there are seven dead Russians."

The ZDF reporter could not agree with that. She warned, "The country cannot endure the conflict much longer." Eigendorf added: "Russia has a lot of potential in terms of people that they can use in this war. And Russia had a very well-functioning war machine."

Outcome of war still open

"I do not see that Ukraine is so convinced here of being able to win this war anytime soon. To be honest, I also don't see any signs on the ground that this is happening," said Eigendorf. Meanwhile, Florence Gaub vigorously shook her head and explained that even ceding territories could be considered a victory because: "Military victory is always a scale."

How the war in Ukraine will end is still unclear. Katrin Eigendorf said on "Markus Lanz" that Ukraine was considering negotiations with Russia behind closed doors. However, she also made it clear: "I still see (...) the determination to defend oneself." Eventually, according to Eigendorf, there has to be "a peace treaty", but so far, there is "no simple solution and no clear goal".

In this context, journalist Martin Machowecz warned that Putin "is no longer willing any compromises". CDU politician Mike Mohring agreed with this and made it clear that the aggressive war "must not become a matter of right" and Putin must not be allowed to win the war. In conclusion, Machowecz stated: "What happens in the autumn will completely change the country."

Federal president's call for more confidence

In a special edition of the commercial broadcaster RTL's current affairs programme RTL DIREKT SPEZIAL aired on 21 February at 21:15 GMT, Germany's head of state Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) warned against pessimism: "Crisis is not fate. We should not pretend that we cannot escape it."

The federal president called on Germans to be more confident in the face of widespread crisis sentiment. He said that like many people, he too was worried "and the situation is damn difficult". Steinmeier referred to the successive crises, the war in Europe, and "thus also the diminishing certainties that we have become accustomed to".

Nevertheless, he would not join the cacophony of those "who talk our country towards the abyss", said Steinmeier in a conversation with journalists Pinar Atalay and Nikolaus Blome. "Crisis is not fate. We should not pretend that we cannot escape it. That's why I say: pessimism is paralyzing. What we need is attitude and reflection on our own strengths."

Protests could be 'turning point'

The ongoing protests against right-wing extremism since mid-January gave him courage, said Steinmeier: "When tens of thousands - old and young - are on the streets, not positioning themselves against something, but for democracy", then this could "be a turning point that ultimately also affects politics".

Steinmeier recalled that over the past two years, society had been "like the rabbit staring at the snake" and observed that "radical voices, extremist voices were getting louder and louder." "We will not let this country be taken away from us by radicals and extremists; we want to draw a clear line between democrats and those who despise or even attack democracy, he said.

Division of Ukraine could end the war

Two years ago, on February 24, 2022, the Russian army attacked Ukraine. The goal was to occupy the neighbouring country and overthrow the government within days. But Russian President Vladimir Putin's plan failed across the board. Ukraine exists, and so does its government. For two years, the war has been raging in this country, infrastructure is destroyed, and thousands of people have died on both sides.

Many German politicians insist that Ukraine must win the war. But according to political scientist Claudia Major, who was a guest on public broadcaster ARD's political talk show Maischberger on 21 February at 21:50 GMT, this goal seems far-fetched.

Ukrainian forces lack material, equipment, soldiers, and money. "They will likely lose more territories this year that they liberated last year." Western support was lacking in many areas, and the year 2024 would be very difficult, Major predicted. According to the military analyst, the supporting states started their production too late, and another Ukrainian offensive would not be possible until the end of this year at the earliest.

Proposal for a quick end to the war

Claudia Major didn't believe in imminent peace negotiations. "That assumes there would be an interest in negotiations. And currently, if you look at the Russian positions, there is no interest in negotiations," said the scientist. Russia didn't want a compromise; it wanted to win the war and abolish Ukraine as an independent state, Major stated.

American historian Mary Sarotte who was also a guest on Maischberger said she might have a viable plan. In an article for Foreign Affairs, she proposed a division of Ukraine, similar to Germany after World War Two. "I have respect for the Ukrainians, and I would prefer Ukraine to win," she said on the show. Under the current conditions, a division of Ukraine would not be ideal but would be the only feasible option among those available today.

Sarotte went into details: "Ukraine defines a new frontline that can be defended militarily. It then enters Nato within these borders, like the Federal Republic did during the Cold War, but still hopes for unity."

Ukraine should become part of the West, with membership of Nato and the EU. Then it would have the opportunity to become militarily and economically strong, similar to West Germany. "This idea has the advantage: We achieve peace without Putin. Because I don't think we can negotiate with Putin (...) We say, 'This is the end for now, and this part now joins NATO. On day X, we will retaliate because that is what Article 5 stipulates.'"

The pitfalls of the proposal

The idea sounds plausible at first, but it also has its pitfalls, which Claudia Major addresses. First, she pointed out the brutal Russification of the occupied Ukrainian territories. Ukrainians were deported from there, making reunification, unlike in 1990 in Germany, very difficult. "Then these territories are lost," said Major. On the other hand, she found the discussion about Nato membership for Western Ukraine "excellent," but the expert doubted that all Nato members would ratify the accession. "Currently, this is not the case," the expert stressed. "We saw last summer at the Nato conference in Vilnius that the USA and Germany did not want this and that they were very much against it."

However, of course, the stance of the two Nato countries could change under new conditions. At least that's how Sarotte saw it: "Better an end with horror than a horror without end. At least the fighting would be over."

Paul Pogba suspended for four years after violating anti-doping rules, uncertainty over his professional future

Italy's Anti-Doping Court has imposed a four-year ban on Juventus player Paul Pogba after he tested positive for the hormone Dhea in a doping test. This decision comes after the player was involved in a doping case following a match between the Vecchia Signora and Udinese on August 20.

The French midfielder had tested positive in an anti-doping test conducted after that match, although he did not participate directly in the game, as he remained on the bench. The France midfielder, in his defense, claimed that the intake of the banned substance was accidental. In addition, he refused to accept a previous agreement with the prosecution, which would have halved the duration of his sanction.

This resolution represents a hard blow not only for the athlete, but also for Juventus, a team that will have him absent for a period that exceeds the duration of his current contract with the club. Thus, the 30-year-old Frenchman's future (he will turn 31 on March 15) has become a real question mark. His professional career could depend on a possible appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne.

The doping case is another negative note for the Russia 2018 World Cup winner, who has suffered from injuries since returning to Juventus from Manchester United, missed the World Cup due to a knee injury. This season, Pogba barely added 52 minutes on the pitch (against Bologna and Empoli, on the second and third matchdays of Serie A).

Last season he was more on the sidelines than on the pitch. He played only 10 matches (161 minutes in total). As a result of this conviction, the Turin institution could opt to terminate his contract, which was worth around 8 million euros net per season until 2026, reduced to 2,000 euros per month since the start of the trial at the Anti-Doping Court.
